<p></p>
<p>Shin Sarugoki is a work written by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/FUJIWARA no Akihira.html">FUJIWARA no Akihira</a>, a scholar who lived in the mid-Heian period. This is a kind of mono zukushi (list of things) or shokunin zukushi (list of craftsmen), in which the author listed social conditions, trades, public entertainment, and culture under the pretense of a man who went to see <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Sarugaku.html">sarugaku</a> (a medieval Noh farce) at Kyo one night. Because of its contents, the book is also considered the origin of a textbook for common people. </p>
<p><h3>Completion</h3>
</p>
<p>The precise date of completion is unknown. But there are two widely held views that it was either completed during the Tengi era (1053-1058), when the author <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/FUJIWARA no Akihira.html">FUJIWARA no Akihira</a> was in his later years, during the Kohei era (1058-1065), or the first year of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Chogen.html">Chogen</a> era (1028). Though both of them are pure suppositions. He signed his name and official title of Ukyo no Daibu (Right City Commissioner) on the first page of the book, and if it is true, although there is no record of his being appointed as Ukyo no Daibu, it would be his final title, which is the only reason why many people suppose that the work was written in his later years. <h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>One night, the author goes to see <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Sarugaku.html">sarugaku</a> at Kyo. It is the most splendid play he has ever seen, so he begins to list genres of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Sarugaku.html">sarugaku</a> and make comments on its masters. Among the visitors who come to see <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Sarugaku.html">sarugaku</a>, the author focuses on a family of Uemon no jo (the third rank official of Court Guard of the Right). And he begins to describe three wives of Uemon no jo, sixteen daughters (or their husbands), and nine sons. 
<br/>(The following are summaries of each chapter, and various terms mentioned here will be explained since they are historically important too.)<br/>
<h3><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Sarugaku.html">Sarugaku</a></h3>
</p>
<p>Among <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Sarugaku.html">sarugaku</a>, the following are the ones which provoke explosive laughter. </p>
<p>Noronji (master of curse): a performance in which an actor runs around, brandishing a sword. </p>
<p>Hikiutomai (dwarf dance): a dance performed by dwarfs. </p>
<p>Dengaku: it has something to do with tamai (rice field dance), which was performed at the rice planting. It became very popular in Heiankyo (the former capital of Japan) during the Eicho era (1096-1097). </p>
<p>Kairaishi/Kugutsushi: a wandering group of public entertainers who make a living by hunting. In the group, men not only do a puppet show but also a display of swordsmanship and conjuring tricks. Women sing and work as prostitutes in the performance. </p>
<p>Tojutsu (Chinese-style conjuring): conjuring tricks and magic which were introduced from China. </p>
<p>Shinadama (juggling with various objects): a performance in which a man tosses various objects similar to modern day juggling. </p>
<p>Riugo: a performance of spinning an object resembling an hourglass drum on a string attached to two sticks. </p>
<p>Yatsudama (literally eight balls): it is a variation of shinadama, and a man juggles with balls. </p>
<p>Hitorisumai (one-man mimicry of wrestling): a performance of one-man mimicry of wrestling, which is supposed to be played by two people. </p>
<p>Hitori <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Sugoroku.html">sugoroku</a> (one-man board games): a performance of the game of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Sugoroku.html">sugoroku</a> (Japanese backgammon) with a doll. </p>
<p>Honenashi (literally no bone): there are various interpretations of this performance, but it would probably have been a display of acrobatics. </p>
<p>Honeari (literally having bones): there are two different views about it; one that it is a performance of imposing dancing, and the other that it is a performance of showing strong muscles and superhuman strength. </p>
<p>The following are performances in which two extremes appear or counterparts support the structure of a story. </p>
<p>Endo tairyo no koshihase (hip movement of the district headman): "koshihase" means posture, and it is a performance of mimicking the way of walking of Tairyo, a superintendent of the district. There is a view that 'Endo' is one of the independent public entertainments. </p>
<p>Ebisuki toneri no ashitsukai: a mimicry of the funny footwork of the prawn-fishing lower official. </p>
<p>Hikami sendo no torihakama: "hikami" is a name of place, Hikami, Hikami district, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Tanba Province.html">Tanba Province</a> (the present Tanba City, Hyogo Prefecture), and "sendo" means a functionary of a temple. It is a mimicry of the functionary exposing his thighs with his <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Hakama (pleated and divided skirt made in fine strips).html">hakama</a> (pleated skirt-like Japanese garment) rolled-up. </p>
<p>Yamashiro oigo no sashiogi (an act of covering one's face with a fan): "oigo" means an aged woman, and it is a performance of mimicking the woman who has seen the man's thighs and bashfully covers her face with a fan. </p>
<p>A tale of a biwa-playing minstrel: a mimicry of a biwa-playing minstrel. </p>
<p>Senzumanzai no sakahokai: "Senzumanzai" is a new year's performer who visits houses, pleading for an auspicious year, and receives a gratuity. "Sakahokai" originally meant saying words of congratulations to each other at a banquet. It is a mimicry of the words made while brewing new sake. </p>
<p>Breastbone of a man with full stomach: it would have been a performance showing the funny motion of the rib cage made when a man drums on his full belly. </p>
<p>Imojiri mai no kubisuji (nape): "imojiri" means a mantis. It seems to be a mimicry of a mantis stretching its forelimbs and waving its neck. </p>
<p>Saint Fukuko's begging for a Buddhist stole<br/>
</p>
<p>Nun Myoko's hunting for diapers<br/>

This chapter has counterparts too.

<p>Hyakuta: a person who was admired most along with Jinnan, who will be mentioned next. His achievements were marvelous, and his performance was eminent among players through the ages (although this portrayal is exactly the same as what <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/KAKINOMOTO no Hitomaro.html">KAKINOMOTO no Hitomaro</a> wrote in manajo). </p>
<p>Jinnan: he always appeared on a stage of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Sarugaku.html">sarugaku</a>, and was praised highly by the public. </p>

<h3>The first lawful wife</h3>
</p>
<p>She is sixty years old (her husband Uemon no jo is forty). Uemon no jo got married to her just because her parents were rich, but he is naturally a lecherous man, regretting that he took a wife who is older than he. Now her hair is white, the wrinkles in her face are like waves in the sea, her teeth fell out, and her saggy breasts are like bull's testicles. Still, she puts on makeup, and blames her husband for not having the slightest interest in her. She had better become a nun, but she still feels jealous of her husband as if she were a poisonous snake or a demon. She believes in the following Shintoist and Buddhist deities in order to get her husband's love. </p>
<p>Kankiten (a god of joy): it refers to Great Holy Kankiten. It was considered a god of producing harmony between married couples. </p>
<p>Saenokami/ Funadonokami: it was originally a god of defending villages from external enemies and fending off epidemics, and also of reproduction and relationships between men and women. </p>
<p>The Igatome festival at Kitsunezaka slope: Kitsunezaka was a steep road which runs from the west of Matsugasaki Village, Atago District, Yamashiro Province (the present <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Sakyo Ward.html">Sakyo Ward</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>) to Kitaiwakura. Igatome was an old fox which was deified as a god of matchmaking. It was a festival for the fox to see a man, and people danced, tapping abalones (female genitals). </p>
<p>The festival of love at Akomachi, Inariyama: people prayed to a fox which became a follower of the Inari gracious god in the Fushimi Inaritaisha Shrine for getting love of men, brandishing dried bonito likened to an erect penis. </p>
<p>The travelers' guardian deity of Gojo: unknown. Shitogimochi (rice cakes for a god) were dedicated to a god. </p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/To-ji Temple.html">To-ji Temple</a>'s Yasha (a demon): Kongo yasha myoo was owned by the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/To-ji Temple.html">To-ji Temple</a>, and it was a statue of Sanmen roppi (three faces and six arms and standing on a lotus with one leg raised) whose three faces are Seiten, Dakichiten, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Benzaiten.html">Benzaiten</a> (a Buddhist goddess of music, learning, eloquence, wealth, longevity, and protection from natural disasters). It was also considered a god of love. A porridge of rice and vegetables were dedicated to this god. </p>
<p>As mentioned above, the first lawful wife was described as a lecherous woman, which makes the work lively. <h3>The second wife</h3>
</p>
<p>She is as old as Uemon no jo, and not so beautiful but a person with a good heart, serving her husband. She is good at many kinds of housework, especially spinning, weaving, dying, and sewing. The following are the clothes she prepares. </p>
