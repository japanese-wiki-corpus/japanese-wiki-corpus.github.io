<h1>Choka (long epic song) (長歌)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Choka is a form of waka (Japanese poem). </p>
<p>Choka consists of 5-7 syllables repeated and concludes with a 5-7-7 ending. 5-7 phrases repeated at least three times and 7 syllables are added at the end. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Manyoshu (Collection of Ten Thousand Leaves).html">Manyoshu</a> (the first major anthology of early Japanese poetry) consists of many Choka poems, such poems had ceased to be written by the time of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kokin Wakashu (A Collection of Ancient and Modern Japanese Poetry).html">Kokin Wakashu</a> (A Collection of Ancient and Modern Japanese Poetry). Choka poems were made mainly on official occasions, and they must be followed by Hanka (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Tanka.html">tanka</a> appendix to a Choka poem). </p>
<p>History of Choka<br/>
The origin of Choka is believed to be in ancient ballads. Many choka poems are found in "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan).html">Nihonshoki</a>" (Chronicles of Japan) and "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kojiki (The Records of Ancient Matters).html">Kojiki</a>" (The Records of Ancient Matters), most of them are in the form with 5-7 phrases repeated at least three times. Choka gradually became a fixed form of verse with a 5-7-7 ending. </p>
<p>By the time of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Manyoshu (Collection of Ten Thousand Leaves).html">Manyoshu</a>, a Hanka poem in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Tanka.html">tanka</a> form (5-7-5-7-7 phrases) was often appended to a Choka poem as a summary. </p>
<p>In the Heian period, when <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kokin Wakashu (A Collection of Ancient and Modern Japanese Poetry).html">Kokin Wakashu</a> was assembled, the term "waka" referred to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Tanka.html">tanka</a> poems and choka was on the decline. </p>
<p>In the Edo period, however, as the study of Japanese classical literature focused on <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Manyoshu (Collection of Ten Thousand Leaves).html">Manyoshu</a>, choka poems revived. </p>
<p>The longest choka poem ever written is Utsubo KUBOTA's "Horyo no Shi" (A Song for Dead Captive); Kubota wrote this famous choka after the end of the Pacific War as a lament for his second son who died while detained in Siberia. </p>
<p>An example of Choka<br/>
Heaven and earth:Since the time they parted,Of manifest divinity,Reaching the heights of awe,In Suruga standsThe high peak of Fuji;The field of heaven:On gazing at the distant sightThe coursing sunLight is blocked andThe shining moonLight goes unseen;The white clouds, too,Shrink from passing by asCeaselesslySnow falls:From mouth to mouth will pass the word,Travelling and speakingOf the peak of Fuji. (Manyoshu No. 317 by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/YAMABE no Akahito.html">YAMABE no Akahito</a>)<br/>
