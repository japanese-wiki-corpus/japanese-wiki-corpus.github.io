<p>Summary<br/>
It takes the style of a dialogue between an 83-year-old nun who, at a young age, served Kokamonin's mother, Kitanomandokoro (legal wife of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Regent.html">regent</a> or chief adviser to the Emperor), and young court ladies living at the foot of Mt. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Higashiyama (Kyoto Prefecture).html">Higashiyama</a> with four chapters of "Preface," "Critique of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Monogatari.html">Monogatari</a> (tales)," "Critique of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kashu.html">Kashu</a> (collection of poetry)," and "Critique of Women." </p>
<p>The "Critique of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Monogatari.html">Monogatari</a>" starts with a short review of chapters, characters, and impressive scenes of "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/The Tale of Genji.html">The Tale of Genji</a>," followed by discussions of tsukuri <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Monogatari.html">monogatari</a>" (fictional tales) in the Heian Period, such as "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Sagoromo Monogatari.html">Sagoromo Monogatari</a>" (The Tale of Sagoromo), "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Yowa no Nezame (Awaken at Midnight).html">Yowa no Nezame</a>" (Awaken at the midnight), "Mitsu no Hamamatsu" (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Hamamatsu Chunagon Monogatari (The Tale of Hamamatsu Chunagon).html">Hamamatsu Chunagon Monogatari</a> [The Tale of Hamamatsu <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Chunagon.html">Chunagon</a>]), and "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Torikaebaya Monogatari (The Changelings).html">Torikaebaya Monogatari</a>" (The Changelings). In the next chapter, discussions focus on poetry stories and collections of poetry, such as "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Ise Monogatari.html">Ise Monogatari</a>" (The Tales of Ise) and "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yamato Monogatari.html">Yamato Monogatari</a>" (Tales of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yamato.html">Yamato</a>), and shift to "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Manyoshu (Collection of Ten Thousand Leaves).html">Manyoshu</a>" (the oldest anthology of Japanese poetry), seven major imperial anthologies of poetry, personal anthologies, and poetry contests. In the last chapter on women, stars in the Imperial court such as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Sei Shonagon.html">Sei Shonagon</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Murasaki Shikibu.html">Murasaki Shikibu</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Izumi Shikibu.html">Izumi Shikibu</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Koshikibu no Naishi.html">Koshikibu no Naishi</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yamato.html">Yamato</a> no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Senji (imperial decree).html">Senji</a>, and Kojiju are the topics of discussion, but the author seems to give the highest praise to Ise, who was a poet, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Imperial Princess Senshi (Nobuko).html">Imperial Princess Senshi</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Teishi.html">FUJIWARA no Teishi</a>, and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Kanshi.html">FUJIWARA no Kanshi</a>. Each of the four women had her own attitude toward her life. The book is concluded by stating that it leaves the critique of men to other tales like "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Okagami (The Great Mirror).html">Okagami</a>" (The Great Mirror). </p>
<p>Mumyo Zoshi is a valuable literary work not only for research on scattered and lost tales but also for understanding how people in the early Medieval Period accepted the Heian literature. </p>
