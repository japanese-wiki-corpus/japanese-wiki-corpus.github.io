The scroll was made of kumo-gami (a type of torinoko that has blue cloud patterns on the upper section and purple ones on the lower) sprinkled with gold and silver kirihaku (gold or silver leaves cut into different shapes and dropped onto the base where glue is applied for sticking the leaves into patterns) with flowers and birds being painted in silver. This is a skilled and distinctive style of calligraphy. </p>
