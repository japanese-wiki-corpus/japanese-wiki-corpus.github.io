<h1>Yamaji no Tsuyu (山路の露)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Yamaji no tsuyu (Dew on the Mountain Road) is one of the sequels to "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/The Tale of Genji.html">The Tale of Genji</a>." </p>
<p>This is the earliest existing sequel to "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/The Tale of Genji.html">The Tale of Genji</a>," and famous as well as "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kumogakure.html">Kumogakure</a> rokujo" (six chapters of Genji's demise). That is why it was given the same treatment as "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/The Tale of Genji.html">The Tale of Genji</a>" written by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Murasaki Shikibu.html">Murasaki Shikibu</a>, and some of the books published during the Edo period contained the sequel together with the tale like <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/The Tale of Genji.html">The Tale of Genji</a> with Illustrations. It was also collected in Zoku <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Gunsho Ruiju (Collection of Historical Documents).html">Gunsho Ruiju</a> (New Classified Documents). It is clear that the chapters were not written by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Murasaki Shikibu.html">Murasaki Shikibu</a> (though nobody can tell if it is a forged book or not), so it is often treated equivalent to forgery, and taken up for the study of forged books. </p>
<p>Completion<br/>
It is still unknown when it was completed and who wrote it, but there is an opinion that it was written between 1271 and before the Oei area. There is a view that the author was Kenreimonin Ukyo no daibu, a daughter of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Koreyuki.html">FUJIWARA no Koreyuki</a>, who wrote "Genji <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shaku.html">shaku</a>" (Commentaries of the Tale of Genji). A digest of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/The Tale of Genji.html">The Tale of Genji</a>, "Genji Kokagami" (Little Mirror of Genji) has it as follows. 
<br/>After that a book called Yamaji no tsuyu was made.'<br/>
It was not included in the fifty-four chapters.'<br/>

<p>Contents<br/>
This is a story about <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kaoru.html">Kaoru</a> in later years, who is the main character of Uji jujo (The Ten Quires of Uji), which describes <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kaoru.html">Kaoru</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Ukifune (The Tale of Genji).html">Ukifune</a> meeting each other again. It is considered a sequel to ''<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Yume no Ukihashi.html">Yume no Ukihashi</a>' (The Floating Bridge of Dreams), the last chapter of "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/The Tale of Genji.html">The Tale of Genji</a>." </p>
