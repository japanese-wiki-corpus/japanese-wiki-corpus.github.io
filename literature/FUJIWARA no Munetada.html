</p>
<p>As a court noble during the transition period between the era of rule by regents and advisors (Sekkan seiji) into the era of rule by Retired Emperors (the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Insei.html">Insei</a> period), he recorded the changes in that period, the events that happened in his immediate circle, and his interactions with famous people of the day, and also noted his own opinions and evaluations of these activities in the diary he left behind, making him a person of great historical significance who recorded his first-person grasp of the period in his diary, a historical record of tremendous value, and passed on that understanding to later generations. </p>
<p>His entries on the activities of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/MINAMOTO no Yoshiie.html">MINAMOTO no Yoshiie</a>, as well as his own evaluations of those activities, are of great value, since they are the impressions of a contemporary of Yoshiie's. In particular, the critical remarks and evaluations he included in his diary of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Insei.html">insei</a> (rule by retired emperors) system as well as the internal strife besetting the sekkan seiji (government by regents and advisors), not to mention his commentary on the internal strife facing the Minamoto clan and the rise of the Taira clan, ensure his fame as one who left behind a valuable historical record, and his diary, the "<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Chuyuki.html">Chuyuki</a>" (Diary of Nakamikado, Minister of the Right) remains a precious historical document that captures the essence of the trends in the last days of the Heian period. </p>
