<h1>FUJIWARA no Munetada (藤原宗忠)</h1>
<p>FUJIWARA no Munetada (1062-May 27, 1141) was a Heian-period court noble. He was also known as Munetada NAKAMIKADO. </p>
<p>Munetada was the eldest son of the Dainagon (chief councilor of state) FUJIWARA no Munetoshi, of the Fujiwara Northern House lineage of FUJIWARA no Michinaga's second son FUJIWARA no Yorimune; his mother was FUJIWARA no Sanetsuna's daughter. The highest court rank he achieved was Udaijin (Minister of the Right), Juichii (Junior First Rank). </p>
<p>He had a younger brother, FUJIWARA no Munesuke. He had several children, including Muneyoshi, Munenari, and Muneshige, all Fujiwaras. He left behind a diary, the "Chuyuki" (Diary of Nakamikado, Minister of the Right). The Diary was so named because its author was called Nakamikado, and was serving as Udaijin (Minister of the Right). </p>
<p>The other works he wrote, including works on musical rhythm and meter like "Inkashu" and "Hakuritsuin," are no longer extant. Waka he composed were included in the "Shoku kokin wakashu" (Collection of Ancient and Modern Poetry, Continued) and the "Gyokuha wakashu" (Collection of Jeweled Leaves). </p>

</p>
<p>As a court noble during the transition period between the era of rule by regents and advisors (Sekkan seiji) into the era of rule by Retired Emperors (the Insei period), he recorded the changes in that period, the events that happened in his immediate circle, and his interactions with famous people of the day, and also noted his own opinions and evaluations of these activities in the diary he left behind, making him a person of great historical significance who recorded his first-person grasp of the period in his diary, a historical record of tremendous value, and passed on that understanding to later generations. </p>
<p>His entries on the activities of MINAMOTO no Yoshiie, as well as his own evaluations of those activities, are of great value, since they are the impressions of a contemporary of Yoshiie's. In particular, the critical remarks and evaluations he included in his diary of the insei (rule by retired emperors) system as well as the internal strife besetting the sekkan seiji (government by regents and advisors), not to mention his commentary on the internal strife facing the Minamoto clan and the rise of the Taira clan, ensure his fame as one who left behind a valuable historical record, and his diary, the "Chuyuki" (Diary of Nakamikado, Minister of the Right) remains a precious historical document that captures the essence of the trends in the last days of the Heian period. </p>
