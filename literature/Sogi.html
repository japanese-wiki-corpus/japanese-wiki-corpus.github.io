<h1>Sogi (宗祇)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Sogi (1421－September 1, 1502) was a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Renga.html">renga</a> (linked-verse) poet of the Muromachi period. His literary names were Jinensai and Shugyokuan. His family name is said to be IIO, but it is still unclear. His birthplace is said to be in Kii or <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Omi Province.html">Omi Province</a>. </p>
<p>He entered <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Shokoku-ji Temple.html">Shokoku-ji Temple</a> in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> in his youth, and made up his mind to pursue <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Renga.html">renga</a> around age 30. He studied <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Renga.html">renga</a> under <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Sozei.html">Sozei</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Senjun.html">Senjun</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shinkei.html">Shinkei</a>, and received instruction in the secret traditions of the Kokinshu (Kokin Denju) by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Tsuneyori TO.html">Tsuneyori TO</a>. </p>
<p>After 1473, he made his residence at Shugyokuan in Kamikyo (Upper <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>), where court nobles, the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> and the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kanrei.html">kanrei</a> (shogunal deputy) lived, associating with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Sanetaka SANJONISHI.html">Sanetaka SANJONISHI</a> and other court nobles, as well as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Masamoto HOSOKAWA.html">Masamoto HOSOKAWA</a> and other high-ranking warriors of the Muromachi <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>). </p>
<p>He also visited powerful local lords (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kokujin.html">kokujin</a>) in the Kinai area and the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> of many Provinces, such as the Ouchi clan in Suo Province, the Takeda clan in Wakasa Province, and the Uesugi clan in Echigo Province. In 1488, he was appointed as the Renga Master of Kitano Shrine and became the leading figure in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Renga.html">renga</a> circles in both name and reality. He soon ceded this post to Kensai and compiled the "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinsen (Food and Alcohol Offering to the gods).html">Shinsen</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Tsukubashu.html">Tsukubashu</a>" (New Tsukuba Collection) with Kensai and others in 1495. He frequently travelled to various parts of the country throughout his life, and in 1502, he died at an inn at the Hakone hotsprings while on the way from Echigo to Mino Province with his disciples <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Socho.html">Socho</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Soseki.html">Soseki</a>, and was buried at <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Jorin-ji Temple (Kyoto City).html">Jorin-ji Temple</a> at Momozono, Suruga Province (currently Susono City, Shizuoka Prefecture). </p>
<p>After the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Onin War.html">Onin War</a>, there was a growing trend towards a revival of the classics, and powerful local clans, especially local lords and lords of fiefs, were interested in the culture of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and remarkably enthusiastic about <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Renga.html">renga</a>. Sogi expressed the technical skill of the original <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Renga.html">renga</a> tradition, and the medieval aesthetics of sublimity and truth expressed in the waka poetry anthology "Shinkokin Wakashu." With <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Renga.html">renga</a>'s popularity throughout the country, and the activities of Sogi and his disciples, this period was the golden age of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Renga.html">renga</a>. </p>
<p>Among his <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Renga.html">renga</a> are such works as; "Minase Sangin Hyakuin" (Three poets at Minase), "Yuyama Sangin Hyakuin" (Three poets at Yuyama), and "Hamori senku"; among his collections of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Renga.html">renga</a> stanzas are "Wasuregusa" (The Forgetting-Plant), "Wakuraba" (Aging Leaves) and "Shitakusa" (The Grasses Beneath); his travel records include "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Shirakawa (the surroundings of the old capital, Kyoto).html">Shirakawa</a> kiko" (Journey to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Shirakawa (the surroundings of the old capital, Kyoto).html">Shirakawa</a>) and "Tsukushi michi no ki" (Record of a Journey to Tsukushi); his treatises on <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Renga.html">renga</a> poetry include "Azuma mondo" (East Country Dialogues) and "Asaji" (Cogon grass), and there are also many commentaries on classic literature. He is another wandering poet, representative of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Renga.html">renga</a> poetry like <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Saigyo.html">Saigyo</a> for waka and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Basho MATSUO.html">Basho MATSUO</a> for <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Haiku.html">haiku</a>. </p>
