<h1>Tokinoriki (時範記)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Tokinoriki is a diary written by a court official named TAIRA no Tokinori during the Heian period. The diary is also called Udaiki, Heiyuki and Udaishoki. Through parts of the diary being cited by other sources, it has been confirmed that the diary ran from 1075 to 1108. The actual diary written by Tokinori does not exist anymore. Partial copies of the diary still exist, such as entries from August of 1097 and from January to April of 1099 at the Archives and Mausolea Department of the Imperial Household Agency, as well as an entry for July 1096 at the National Museum of Japanese History. The portion held by the Archives and Mausolea Department of the Imperial Household Agency has been reprinted in the 'Journal of the Archives and Mausolea Department,' No. 14, 17 and 32, by Shohachi HAYAKAWA and Yasumasa MIYAZAKI. </p>
