<h1>Emperor Kiritsubo (桐壺帝)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Emperor Kiritsubo/Kiritsubo-in is the first Emperor in "The Tale of Genji" (the period of reign: from the chapter of 'Kiritsubo' [The Paulownia Court] to 'Hana no En' [The Festival of the Cherry Blossoms]). A fictitious character. Omiya was his sister. 
<br/>Because he favored Kiritsubo no koi (lower class court lady), he was called 'Emperor Kiritsubo.'<br/>
He was the father of Hikaru Genji, the main character of "The Tale of Genji." </p>
<p>He favored Kiritsubo no koi, ignoring other powerful wives, and before long Genji was born, but anxieties made her sick, and she died of disease. Emperor Kiritsubo experienced so much deep grief that those around him could not look on with indifference, and encouraged him to have Fujitsubo (the fourth princess of the previous Emperor), who looked exactly like late Kiritsubo no koi, enter the Imperial court, and he favored her, making her the Empress when she gave birth to the tenth prince (later known as Emperor Reizei). In fact, Emperor Reizei was an illicit child between Hikaru Genji and Fujitsubo, but it is not told in the tale whether Emperor Kiritsubo knew that. His sickness got worse in the chapter 'Sakaki' (The Green Branch), and he passed away when Genji was 23. In the chapter 'Akashi,' his departed spirit appeared, and helped Genji when he was in distress. </p>
