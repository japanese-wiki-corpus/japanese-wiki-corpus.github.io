<h1>MINAMOTO no Kintada (源公忠)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>MINAMOTO no Kintada (889 - December 7, 948) was a Japanese official and poet of the mid-Heian period. His father was MINAMOTO no Kuninori, who was the son of the Emperor Koko. One of his sons was MINAMOTO no Saneakira, who is regarded as one of the Sanjurokkasen (36 Immortal Poets) along with Kintada. He is one of the Sanjurokkasen. </p>
<p>He worked as Kurodo (Chamberlain) in the reigns of the Emperor Daigo and the Emperor Suzaku, and later ended his career as Jushiinoge (Junior Fourth Rank, Lower Grade), Udaiben (Major Controller of the Right). He took a lively role in uta-awase (poetry contests) and byobu-uta (screen poems, poems composed following the pictures on folding screens), and KI no Tsurayuki composed a farewell poem and presented it to him. He excelled at the incense ceremony and falconry. There are some anecdotes about him in the 'Yamato monogatari' (Tales of Yamato) and the 'Okagami' (Great Mirror). </p>
<p>His poems were selected for chokusen wakashu (anthologies of poems collected by Imperial command) starting when 'Goshui Wakashu' (Later Collection of Gleanings of Japanese Poetry) was compiled and onwards. 
<br/>He left a personal collection 'Kintada shu.'<br/>
