<p>KI no Haseo (born 845, died March 6, 912) was a high-ranking court noble and literatus who lived from the early into the mid-Heian period. His father's name was KI no Sadanori.

His Chinese courtesy name (azana) was "<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Kakei.html">Kakei</a>." He was popularly known as Ki no Nagon (Counselor Ki). </p>
<p>In 890 he became Zusho no kami (head of the Documents Office), and thereafter succeeded to the posts of Monjo hakase (Chief Calligrapher to the Court) and Daigaku no kami (Headmaster of the Academy); in 902 he was appointed <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Sangi.html">Sangi</a> (Director of Palace Affairs), and then in 911 (Engi 11) he was promoted to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Chunagon.html">Chunagon</a> (vice-councilor of state).
