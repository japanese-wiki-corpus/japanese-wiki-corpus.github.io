<h1>KI no Haseo (紀長谷雄)</h1>
<p>KI no Haseo (born 845, died March 6, 912) was a high-ranking court noble and literatus who lived from the early into the mid-Heian period. His father's name was KI no Sadanori. Among his children were KI no Yoshimochi, who is thought to have written the Chinese preface to the 'Kokin wakashu' (Collected Waka from Ancient and Modern Times, usually abbreviated as "Kokinshu"), and KI no Yoshito, who served as kami (governor) of Iyo Province. His Chinese courtesy name (azana) was "Kakei." He was popularly known as Ki no Nagon (Counselor Ki). </p>
<p>In 890 he became Zusho no kami (head of the Documents Office), and thereafter succeeded to the posts of Monjo hakase (Chief Calligrapher to the Court) and Daigaku no kami (Headmaster of the Academy); in 902 he was appointed Sangi (Director of Palace Affairs), and then in 911 (Engi 11) he was promoted to Chunagon (vice-councilor of state). The highest court rank he reached was Jusanmi (Junior third rank). He served as jidoku (also rendered "jito"), or Imperial tutor, to Emperor Daigo. Haseo studied under MIYAKO no Yoshika, SUGAWARA no Michizane, and OKURA no Yoshiyuki, and participated in the compilation of the 'Kanke goshu' (Later Collection of the Sugawara family), and was also involved in the compilation of the 'Engi Kyakushiki' (the Engi Codes). Michizane, moreover, recognized Haseo's potential abilities, and at his suggestion Haseo was chosen to serve as vice-envoy in the final diplomatic mission to Tang China, all such missions having been discontinued earlier. </p>
<p>There is an anthology of his Chinese poetry called the 'Kikeshu' (Collected Poems of the Ki family), while some of his waka were included in the 'Gosen wakashu' (Later Selected Waka Anthology). </p>
