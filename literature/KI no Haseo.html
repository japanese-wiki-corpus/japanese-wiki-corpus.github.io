<p>In 890 he became Zusho no kami (head of the Documents Office), and thereafter succeeded to the posts of Monjo hakase (Chief Calligrapher to the Court) and Daigaku no kami (Headmaster of the Academy); in 902 he was appointed <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Sangi.html">Sangi</a> (Director of Palace Affairs), and then in 911 (Engi 11) he was promoted to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Chunagon.html">Chunagon</a> (vice-councilor of state).

He served as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Jidoku (imperial tutor).html">jidoku</a> (also rendered "jito"), or Imperial tutor, to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Daigo.html">Emperor Daigo</a>.
