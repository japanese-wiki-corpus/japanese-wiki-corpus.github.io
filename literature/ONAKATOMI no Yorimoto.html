<h1>ONAKATOMI no Yorimoto (大中臣頼基)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>ONAKATOMI no Yorimoto (c. 886 - c. 958) was a waka poet in the mid-Heian period. His father was Bingo no jo (an officer in Bingo) ONAKATOMI no Sukemichi, and his child ONAKATOMI no Yoshinobu was one of the Nashitsubo no Gonin (Five Gentlemen of the Pear Chamber). He is one of the Sanjurokkasen (36 Immortal Poets). The Onakatomi clan was a family lineage in charge of matters relating to Shintoism. Along with Yoshinobu, ONAKATOMI no Sukechika, and Ise no Taifu, Yorimoto was an originator of waka poems of the Onakatomi clan. He became, ultimately, a chief priest and Jushii Jingi taifu (Junior Fourth Rank, Senior Assistant Head of the Department of Shinto). As he enjoyed the deep confidence of the Emperor Uda, he presented poems in "Oigawa gyoko waka" (the Waka from the Sovereign's Excursion to the Oi-gawa River) and "Teijiin Uta-awase" (the poetry contest held in Teijiin). </p>
<p>In addition, he composed many poems such as byobu-uta (screen poems) and Gaka (Celebration Poetry). His waka poems were selected for chokusen wakashu (anthologies of Japanese poetry compiled by Imperial command) starting when "Shui Wakashu" (Collection of Gleanings of Japanese Poems) was compiled and onwards. </p>
<p><h3>He privately compiled "Yorimoto shu."</h3>
