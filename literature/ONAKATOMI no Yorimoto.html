<h1>ONAKATOMI no Yorimoto (大中臣頼基)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>ONAKATOMI no Yorimoto (c. 886 - c. 958) was a waka poet in the mid-Heian period. His father was Bingo no jo (an officer in Bingo) ONAKATOMI no Sukemichi, and his child <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/ONAKATOMI no Yoshinobu.html">ONAKATOMI no Yoshinobu</a> was one of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Nashitsubo no Gonin (Five Gentlemen of the Pear Chamber).html">Nashitsubo no Gonin</a> (Five Gentlemen of the Pear Chamber). He is one of the Sanjurokkasen (36 Immortal Poets). The <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Onakatomi clan.html">Onakatomi clan</a> was a family lineage in charge of matters relating to Shintoism. Along with Yoshinobu, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/ONAKATOMI no Sukechika.html">ONAKATOMI no Sukechika</a>, and Ise no Taifu, Yorimoto was an originator of waka poems of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Onakatomi clan.html">Onakatomi clan</a>. He became, ultimately, a chief priest and Jushii Jingi taifu (Junior Fourth Rank, Senior Assistant Head of the Department of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a>). As he enjoyed the deep confidence of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Uda.html">Emperor Uda</a>, he presented poems in "Oigawa <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Gyoko.html">gyoko</a> waka" (the Waka from the Sovereign's Excursion to the Oi-gawa River) and "Teijiin <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Uta-awase.html">Uta-awase</a>" (the poetry contest held in Teijiin). </p>
