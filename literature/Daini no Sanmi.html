<h1>Daini no Sanmi (大弐三位)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Daini no Sanmi (ca. 999-ca. 1082) was a female poet who lived during the mid-Heian period. Her father was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Nobutaka.html">FUJIWARA no Nobutaka</a> and her mother was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Murasaki Shikibu.html">Murasaki Shikibu</a>. Her real name was FUJIWARA no Kataiko (also known as Kenshi). She was also called To no Sanmi, Echigo no Ben, or Ben no Menoto (nurse of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Imperial Princess Teishi.html">Imperial Princess Teishi</a>). </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>In 1001, when she was about three, she lost her father. In 1017, age about eighteen, she succeeded her mother and served <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Shoshi.html">FUJIWARA no Shoshi</a> (Jotomonin), the second consort of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Ichijo.html">Emperor Ichijo</a>. At that time, she was called Echigo no Ben after her grandfather's province of assignment, Echigo, and his official title. During this period, it is known that she had relationships with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Yorimune.html">FUJIWARA no Yorimune</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/FUJIWARA no Sadayori.html">FUJIWARA no Sadayori</a>, MINAMOTO no Asato, and so on. Subsequently, she was married to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Kanetaka.html">FUJIWARA no Kanetaka</a>, the second son of the Chancellor (chief adviser to the Emperor) <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Michikane.html">FUJIWARA no Michikane</a>, and bore him a girl. In 1025, when Imperial Prince Chikahito (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Goreizei.html">Emperor Goreizei</a>) was born, she was appointed as his nursemaid. </p>
<p>By 1037, she was married again to Togu Gonnotaijo TAKASHINA no Nariakira, and in 1038 she gave birth to TAKASHINA no Tameie. In 1054, when <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Goreizei.html">Emperor Goreizei</a> ascended the throne, she was promoted to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Jusanmi.html">Jusanmi</a> (Junior Third Rank), and her husband, Nariakira, also took office as Dazai no daini (Senior Assistant Governor-General of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Dazai-fu (local government office in Kyushu region).html">Dazai-fu</a> offices). Her court name, Dazai no Sanmi, was derived from her official court rank and her husband's official title. </p>
<p>Around this period, she composed poems at various utaawase (poetry contest) such as 'Jotomonin Kikuawase' (1028), 'Dairi Utaawase' (the palace poetry contest) (1049), and '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Imperial Princess Yushi.html">Imperial Princess Yushi</a>'s Utaawase' (1050). In 1078, she joined 'Dairi Goban Utaawase' on behalf of her son, Tameie, in spite of her great age, about eighty. </p>
<p>Her collection of poetry is "Daini no Sanmi shu" (also called To no Sanmi shu"). Her thirty-seven poems were collected for "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Goshui Wakashu (Later Collection of Gleanings of Japanese Poetry).html">Goshui Wakashu</a>" (Later Collection of Gleanings of Japanese Poetry). In addition, her poem, 'Near Mt. Arima, the wind blows rustling Ina's bamboo grasses. It is you who forgot me, though I still love you.' was selected for 'Ogura <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Hyakunin Isshu.html">Hyakunin Isshu</a>' (Ogura Anthology of One Hundred Tanka-poems by One Hundred Poets). </p>
<p>She is sometimes mentioned as the author of Uji jujo (The Ten Quires of Uji) of "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/The Tale of Genji.html">The Tale of Genji</a>" and "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Sagoromo Monogatari.html">Sagoromo Monogatari</a>" (The Tale of Sagoromo), though it is not certain whether or not this is true. </p>
