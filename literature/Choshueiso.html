<h1>Choshueiso (長秋詠藻)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Choshueiso is a private poetry collection of FUJIWARA no Toshinari. Three volumes. This is one of the six great private poetry collections. It consists of 729 waka (thirty-one syllable Japanese poem) and 3 choka (long poem). Toshinari selected his own poems to make this collection and presented it to Cloistered Imperial Prince Shukaku in 1178. Toshinari was kotaigo gu no daibu (Master of the Empress Dowager's Household) and kotaigo-gu (the Empress Dowager) was called Choshu-gu, thus this collection was called Choshueiso. </p>
