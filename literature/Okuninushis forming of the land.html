<p>This article describes <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Okuninushi.html">Okuninushi</a>'s forming of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Ashihara no nakatsukuni (葦原中国).html">Ashihara no nakatsukuni</a> (Literally, "Central Land of Reed Plains", which refers to the human world) in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Japanese Mythology.html">Japanese Mythology</a>. </p>

When <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Okuninushi.html">Okuninushi</a> stood at Cape Miho in Izumo, a deity arrived across the ocean, riding on the waves in Amenokagaminofune (a boat made from the pod of the flowering vine called kagami), and wearing the skin of a small bird (it should be a moth, an error of Kanji characters). <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Okuninushi.html">Okuninushi</a> asked the small deity name but it didn't answer. None of his followers knew his name, either. There a toad appeared and said "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Kuebiko.html">Kuebiko</a> should know his name." <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Kuebiko.html">Kuebiko</a> was called and answered, "His name is <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Sukunabikona.html">Sukunabikona</a>, a child of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Kamimusubi.html">Kamimusubi</a> no kami." <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Kuebiko.html">Kuebiko</a> is a Yamada no kakashi (scarecrow) who was incapable of walking but possessing broad knowledge of things in the world. </p>
<p><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Sukunabikona.html">Sukunabikona</a> acknowledged that <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Sukunabikona.html">Sukunabikona</a> was his child, and ordered his son to cooperate <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Okuninushi.html">Okuninushi</a> in the forming of the land. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Okuninushi.html">Okuninushi</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Sukunabikona.html">Sukunabikona</a> cooperated toward the development of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Ashihara no nakatsukuni (葦原中国).html">Ashihara no nakatsukuni</a>. After that, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Sukunabikona.html">Sukunabikona</a> passed to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Tokoyo (eternal night).html">Tokoyo</a> no kuni (the "eternal land"). </p>
<p><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Okuninushi.html">Okuninushi</a> wondered how he could form the land by himself. Then a deity came across the ocean, shedding the light. The deity said, "I am your Sakimitama kushimitama (soul(s) of blessing and auspiciousness), so if you worship me respectfully, I will cooperate with you in the forming of the land." <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Okuninushi.html">Okuninushi</a> asked the procedure of worship, and the soul answered to enshrine it at the top of the mountain in the east of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yamato Province.html">Yamato Province</a>. This deity is <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Omononushi.html">Omononushi</a> that resides in Mt. Mimoro (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Mt. Miwa (a cone-shaped gentle mountain in Sakurai City, Nara Prefecture).html">Mt. Miwa</a>) today. </p>
