<h1>Watsuji Rinrigaku (Ethics) (和辻倫理学)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Watsuji Rinrigaku is the name of the ethical theory developed by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Tetsuro WATSUJI.html">Tetsuro WATSUJI</a>. The theory of ethics established by Watsuji was based on the study of the history of Japanese thought, and is a body of philosophy unique to the Japanese, together with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kitaro NISHIDA.html">Kitaro NISHIDA</a>'s Nishida philosophy. </p>
<p>Categorization<br/>
Watsuji's books on ethics can be roughly divided into two categories. </p>
<p>Books on theory<br/>
</p>
<p>Books in this category refer to the philosophy of Heidegger and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kitaro NISHIDA.html">Kitaro NISHIDA</a> and affirm the concept of 'connection' that is the universal basis of ethics. </p>
<p>"Ningen no gaku to shite no rinrigaku" (Ethics as the Study of Man)<br/>
</p>
<p>"Rinrigaku" (Ethics), is comprised of three volumes (the revised version has two volumes; the Iwanami Bunko version has four volumes)<br/>
</p>
<p>Books on interpretation<br/>
</p>
<p>In this category, he applied the concept of 'connection', described in books on theory, to the history of Japanese thought in an attempt to justify Japanese ethics within a specific context. He diligently analyzed the texts covering the periods between the ancient "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kojiki (The Records of Ancient Matters).html">Kojiki</a>", the "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan).html">Nihonshoki</a>" as well as the study of Japanese classical literature during the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Edo Period.html">Edo Period</a> with this method of interpretation. </p>
<p>"Nihon kodai bunka" (Ancient <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Japanese Culture.html">Japanese Culture</a>)<br/>
</p>
<p>"Nihon seishinshi kenkyu" (A Study of the History of the Japanese Spirit)<br/>
</p>
<p>"Sonno <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Shiso (Perilla).html">shiso</a> to sono dento" (The Idea of Reverence for the Emperor and the Imperial Tradition)<br/>
</p>
<p>"Nihon rinri shisoshi" (History of Japanese Ethical Thought)<br/>
</p>
<p>Characteristics<br/>
One characteristic of Watsuji Rinrigaku is that the two levels described above are blended together so that the ethics that were pursued as theory were harmonized with a specific history. </p>
<p>Along with this characteristic is the concern that it will result in the statement that Japan is the most ethical community. </p>
<p>In other words, the purpose of Watsuji Rinrigaku was to understand the true state of real life by way of interpretation rather than simply constructing a new concept. That is, Watsuji defined rinri (ethics) as 'the basis of existence of human community, or the law of human beings' (on "Rinrigaku"). </p>
