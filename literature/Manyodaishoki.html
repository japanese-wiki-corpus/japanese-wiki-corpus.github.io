<h1>Manyodaishoki (万葉代匠記)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>"Manyodaishoki" is a commentary on "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Manyoshu (Collection of Ten Thousand Leaves).html">Manyoshu</a>" (the oldest anthology of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Tanka.html">tanka</a>) by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Keichu.html">Keichu</a>, who was a scholar of Japanese classical literature during the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Edo Period.html">Edo Period</a>. </p>
<p>The word 'daisho came from "Roshi" (Daodejing) volume two and "Monzen" (Wen-hsuan, ancient Chinese poems) volume 46 "Ode to Heroes", meaning that 'there may be some errors because this book is made on behalf of the original authors.'<br/>
At that time, the lord of the Mito Tokugawa family <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Mitsukuni TOKUGAWA.html">Mitsukuni TOKUGAWA</a> wished to collect transcribed and published books on "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Manyoshu (Collection of Ten Thousand Leaves).html">Manyoshu</a>" to revise them, and Choryu SHIMOKOBE was in charge of making commentary during the Kanbun and Enpo periods. When Choryu became ill and could no longer perform his duty, he recommended <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Keichu.html">Keichu</a> who shared the same interest for the task. </p>
<p>The creation of "Daishoki" started around 1683 and 'the first edition' was completed around 1687 followed by 'the final version' in 1690. After the first edition was completed, various editions such as (四點万葉集 and 中院本) and "Shirin Saiyosho" (Commentary of Leaves from a Forest of Words) were handed to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Keichu.html">Keichu</a>, and he revised the first edition based on these new documents to compose the final version. In the first edition, Choryu's theory was cited in many instances, and the book effectively depicted <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Keichu.html">Keichu</a>'s commentary and criticism in regard to a single poem. The final edition was better in that it proposed a more genuine interpretation of the poem and was precise based on the documents. </p>
<p>As a study on "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Manyoshu (Collection of Ten Thousand Leaves).html">Manyoshu</a>", "Daishoki" has a good reputation as an innovative project following those of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Sengaku.html">Sengaku</a> during the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period and Kigin KITAMURA during the Genroku era. This book is representative of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Keichu.html">Keichu</a>'s commentary and approach supported by his extensive knowledge of Buddhist scriptures and Chinese classic books that was not biased by the author's opinion or ideology. </p>
