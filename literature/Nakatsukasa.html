<h1>Nakatsukasa (中務)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Nakatsukasa (ca. 912-ca. 991) was a female poet who lived in the mid-Heian period. She was one of the 36 Immortal Poets. Because her father, Imperial Prince Atsuyoshi, a son of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Uda.html">Emperor Uda</a>, was Nakatsukasa-kyo (Minister of the Ministry of Central Affairs), she was designated as Nakatsukasa. Her mother was a female poet, Ise. Her parental half-brothers were Gyobukyo (Minister of Justice) MINAMOTO no Koko and MINAMOTO no Hoko. </p>
