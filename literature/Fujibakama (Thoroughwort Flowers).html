<h1>Fujibakama (Thoroughwort Flowers) (藤袴)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Fujibakama is one of the 54 chapters of "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/The Tale of Genji.html">The Tale of Genji</a>." It is the 30th chapter. 
<br/>The title of this chapter was derived from the waka poem that <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Yugiri (The Tale of Genji).html">Yugiri</a> composed: 'I am thoroughwort laden with dew and in the same field as you are; Please have pity on me.'<br/>
</p>
<p>Summary<br/>
<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Hikaru Genji.html">Hikaru Genji</a>, age 37, in autumn. </p>
<p><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Omiya (The Tale of Genji).html">Omiya</a> passed away, and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Tamakazura (The Tale of Genji).html">Tamakazura</a>, who had been appointed to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Naishi no tsukasa.html">Naishi no tsukasa</a> (female palace attendant), was in mourning for her grandmother, and was worried about entering the service. Then <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Yugiri (The Tale of Genji).html">Yugiri</a> appeared as a messenger for his father, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Hikaru Genji.html">Hikaru Genji</a>, and he offered thoroughwort flowers to her on the pretext of kinship, confessing his secret love for her, but she did not take him seriously. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Yugiri (The Tale of Genji).html">Yugiri</a> came back to Genji, and tenaciously questioned him about what he really intended to do with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Tamakazura (The Tale of Genji).html">Tamakazura</a>, saying that there was a rumor that he would take her as one of his concubines. </p>
<p>The period of mourning ended, and it was decided that <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Tamakazura (The Tale of Genji).html">Tamakazura</a> would enter the service in October. Her suitors would not give up, though, and sent letters; Higekuro and Hotaru Hyobukyonomiya were especially infatuated with her. Out of all of them, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Tamakazura (The Tale of Genji).html">Tamakazura</a> only replied to Hotaru Hyobukyonomiya. </p>
