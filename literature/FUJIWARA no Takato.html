<h1>FUJIWARA no Takato (藤原高遠)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>FUJIWARA no Takato (949 - June 22, 1013) was a waka poet in the mid-Heian period. His father was FUJIWARA no Tadatoshi and his grandfather was FUJIWARA no Saneyori. His mother was the daughter of FUJIWARA no Korefumi. FUJIWARA no Sanesuke was his younger brother who wrote 'Shoyuki' (Diary of FUJIWARA no Sanesuke). His official court rank ultimately became Hisangi Shosanmi (an advisor at large, Senior Third Rank). He is regarded as one of the Chuko sanjurokkasen (medieval 36 Immortal Poets). He was accomplished at composing waka poems as well as playing fue (Japanese flute). </p>
<p>In 990, he became Hisangi and then worked for Hyoe-fu (Headquarters of the Middle Palace Guards) and so on. In 1004, he became Dazai no daini (Senior Assistant Governor-General of the Dazai-fu offices) and was conferred Shosanmi the next year. In 1009, he had to give up his post of Dazai no daini because he got sued by Chikuzen no kuni no Kami (Governor of Chikuzen Province) FUJIWARA no Fuminobu. He was a fue teacher of the Emperor Ichijo ("Makura no soshi" (The Pillow Book) 230). The sound of his fue was so beautiful that he was conferred Sanmi (Third Rank) ("Hyakuren sho" (History book from the Kamakura period) February 14, 990). </p>
<p>In September 966, he participated in Sanjosadaijin FUJIWARA no Yoritada senzai-awase (a poetry match held by FUJIWARA no Yoritada). 27 of his poems were selected for chokusen wakashu (anthologies of Japanese poetry compiled by Imperial command) starting when 'Shui Wakashu' (Collection of Gleanings of Japanese Poems) was compiled and onwards. 
<br/>He privately compiled 'Daini Takato shu.'<br/>
