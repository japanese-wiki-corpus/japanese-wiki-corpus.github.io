<p>Hamamatsu <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Chunagon.html">Chunagon</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Monogatari.html">Monogatari</a> is a tale reportedly written by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/SUGAWARA no Takasue.html">SUGAWARA no Takasue</a>'s daughter, who also wrote "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Sarashina Nikki.html">Sarashina Nikki</a>" (Sarashina Diary). It was completed around the middle of the 11th century. It is also called "Mitsu no Hamamatsu." </p>
<p>It is classified as narrative literature of the latter half of the Heian period, born under influence of "Genji <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Monogatari.html">Monogatari</a>" (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/The Tale of Genji.html">The Tale of Genji</a>). Originally, it was composed of six volumes in total, but only five volumes, excluding the first volume, exist now. </p>
<p><h3>Contents</h3>
</p>
<p>The main theme focuses on the love affairs between Hamamatsu <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Chunagon.html">Chunagon</a>, the main character and various ladies; such as a tragic love with Daihime, a daughter of his stepfather, Sadaisho, and then, a love and parting with the empress in Tang (China) where he went to see his dead father who visited his dream and telling him that he reincarnated as a prince of Tang. They are paranormal love stories based on dream visions and Rinne <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Tensho.html">Tensho</a> (all things being in flux through the endless circle of birth, death, and rebirth - the circle of transmigration). </p>
<p>Influence<br/>
Late in his life, Yukio MISHIMA was strongly attracted by this tale and wrote "Hojo no Umi" (The sea of Fertility) based on the theme of Rinne <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Tensho.html">Tensho</a>. </p>
