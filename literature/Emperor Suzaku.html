<p>Emperor <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Suzaku (the Vermilion Bird).html">Suzaku</a> (Suzaku no Mikado), or <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Suzakuin.html">Suzakuin</a>, is the second emperor in "<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/The Tale of Genji.html">The Tale of Genji</a>" (the period of his reign, the chapter of 'Aoi' (Hollyhock) to '<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Miotsukushi (The Tale of Genji).html">Miotsukushi</a>' (Channel Buoys)). A fictitious character. He appears from the chapter of '<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Kiritsubo.html">Kiritsubo</a>' (The Paulownia Court) to '<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Yugiri (The Tale of Genji).html">Yugiri</a>' (Evening Mist). </p>
<p>He was Togu, the first prince, of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Emperor Kiritsubo.html">Emperor Kiritsubo</a>, and his mother was Kokiden no <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Nyogo (rank of court lady).html">nyogo</a> (the Empress Kokiden). He was three years older than <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Hikaru Genji.html">Hikaru Genji</a>, and they had different mothers. At the age of 24, his father <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Emperor Kiritsubo.html">Emperor Kiritsubo</a> abdicated the throne in favor of his son (between the chapters of '<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Hana no En.html">Hana no En</a>' (The Festival of the Cherry Blossoms) and 'Aoi'). </p>
<p>When he was still Togu, he proposed marriage to Aoi no ue (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Lady Aoi.html">Lady Aoi</a>), but <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Sadaijin (Minister of the Left).html">Sadaijin</a> (Minister of the Left) refused him. After that, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Oborozukiyo (The Tale of Genji).html">Oborozukiyo</a> (the misty moon) was scheduled to enter the Imperial court, but it was canceled due to her illicit intercourse with Genji (later <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Oborozukiyo (The Tale of Genji).html">Oborozukiyo</a> served as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Naishi.html">Naishi</a> no Kami (Principal Handmaid)). After all, the Emperor <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Suzaku (the Vermilion Bird).html">Suzaku</a> did not have an influential wife, and there was no Empress in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kokyu (empresss residence).html">kokyu</a> (empress's residence). </p>
<p>He had a mild character, and felt small in the presence of Genji, who was superior to him in everything such as figure and education, so the Emperor <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Suzaku (the Vermilion Bird).html">Suzaku</a> did not blame <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Oborozukiyo (The Tale of Genji).html">Oborozukiyo</a> and loved her even after he knew the illicit intercourse between Genji and she. However, he could not stop her mother, the Empress Kokiden, and others from banishing Genji. After Genji confined himself to his residence at Suma, the Emperor <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Suzaku (the Vermilion Bird).html">Suzaku</a> received a reprimand from Kiritsuboin, who appeared in his dream, and suffered from eye trouble due to the anxiety. His maternal grandfather, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daijo-daijin (Grand minister of state).html">Daijo-daijin</a> (Grand minister of state) (the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Emperor Kiritsubo.html">Emperor Kiritsubo</a>'s <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Udaijin (Minister of the Right).html">Udaijin</a> (Minister of the Right)) passed away, which also led him to call Genji back at last, overcoming the opposition of his mother, and at the age of 32, he abdicated the throne in favor of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Emperor Reizei.html">Emperor Reizei</a>, his younger brother by a different mother (in fact, he was Genji's son). After his retirement, he lived in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Suzakuin.html">Suzakuin</a> (this is why he came to be known by the name of 'Suzakutei' or '<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Suzakuin.html">Suzakuin</a>'), and he lived with <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Oborozukiyo (The Tale of Genji).html">Oborozukiyo</a> happily, but at the same time he loved the Empress Akikonomu, a daughter of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Rokujo no Miyasudokoro.html">Rokujo no Miyasudokoro</a>, though his love was hopeless due to the intention of Genji, who became an adoptive father of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Saigu (a vestal virgin princess serving at the Ise-jingu Shrine and her residence).html">Saigu</a> (Imperial Princess appointed to serve the deities of the Ise-jingu Shrine). </p>
<p>At the age of 42 or 43, his mother passed away, and he became a priest quickly due to his mother's death and his own sickness. Then he made his beloved daughter, Onna Sannomiya, who did not have a supporter, leave the Imperial family and marry Genji. 
<br/>However, this marriage failed, and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Suzakuin.html">Suzakuin</a>, who did not know of the sexual intercourse between Onna Sannomiya and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Kashiwagi (The Tale of Genji).html">Kashiwagi</a>, made Onna Sannomiya become a nun complaining to glacial Genji. ('<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Wakana (new herbs) (The Tale of Genji).html">Wakana</a>' (Spring Shoots) and '<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Kashiwagi (The Tale of Genji).html">Kashiwagi</a>' (The Oak Tree))<br/>
<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Onna Ninomiya.html">Onna Ninomiya</a> (Ochiba no Miya) also hoped to become a nun due to the death of her husband, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Kashiwagi (The Tale of Genji).html">Kashiwagi</a>, and her mother, but he did not allow her, worrying about appearances and what people would think. His later years were not known, and the only thing that is known in the chapter of '<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Yadorigi.html">Yadorigi</a>' (The Ivy), is that he already passed away. </p>
