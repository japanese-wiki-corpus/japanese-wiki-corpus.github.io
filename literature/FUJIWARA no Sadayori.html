<h1>FUJIWARA no Sadayori (藤原定頼)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>FUJIWARA no Sadayori (995 - February 8, 1045) was a court noble and poet in the mid-Heian period. His father was FUJIWARA no Kinto. His mother was the daughter of Imperial Prince Akihira (son of Emperor Murakami). Called Shijo Chunagon (vice-councilor of state of Shijo), he became a Gonchunagon (Acting Great Councillor) with Shonii (Senior Second Rank). He was regarded as one of the medieval 36 Immortal Poets. </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>FUJIWARA no Sadayori submitted his verses to important poetry contests such as the 'Poetry Contest Hosted by Jotomonin Akiko' (1032) and 'Poetry Contest held by FUJIWARA no Yorimichi the Regent Minister of the Left' (1035). There is an anecdote about him in which he was ridiculed by KOSHIKIBU no Naishi for being a little frivolous. He had affairs with Sagami (the poet) and DAINI no Sanmi. He was a gifted musician, reciter of sutras, and calligrapher. </p>
