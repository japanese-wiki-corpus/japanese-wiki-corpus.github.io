<h1>Dewa no ben (出羽弁)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Dewa no ben (around 1007? - date of death unknown) was a female waka poet in the mid Heian period. Her name is also pronounced as Idewa no ben. Some people say her father was Dewa no kami (governer of Dewa Province) TAIRA no Suenobu, but others say it was Kaga no kami (governer of Kaga Province) TAIRA no Hidenobu (Heian period). </p>
<p>She served as the second consort of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Ichijo.html">Emperor Ichijo</a>, FUJIWARA no Akiko (Shoshi), her younger sister, and the second consort of the Emperor Goichijo, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Ishi.html">FUJIWARA no Ishi</a>, and her daughter <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Imperial Princess Shoshi.html">Imperial Princess Shoshi</a>. In 1033, she composed and presented byobu-uta (screen poems) for <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Rinshi.html">MINAMOTO no Rinshi</a> on the celebration of her 70th birthday, as well as flourishing in many Utaawase (poetry competition). </p>
<p>Her poems were selected for Chokusen wakashu (anthology of Japanese poetry compiled by Imperial command) including '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Goshui Wakashu (Later Collection of Gleanings of Japanese Poetry).html">Goshui Wakashu</a>' (4th imperial anthology). 
<br/>One of her personal collections of poetry is 'DEWA no ben shu.'<br/>
