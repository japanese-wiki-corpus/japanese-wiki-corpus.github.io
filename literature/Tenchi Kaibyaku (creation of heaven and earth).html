<h1>Tenchi Kaibyaku (creation of heaven and earth) (天地開闢 (日本神話))</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Tenchi Kaibyaku is a time when the world represented by heaven and earth was first created. </p>
<p>In a narrow sense, it refers to the opening line of "Nihonshoki" (Chronicles of Japan): 'Long, long ago, when the heaven and the earth were not separated yet, and light and darkness were not distinguished...'<br/>
In this article, however, the wide meaning of Tenchi Kaibyaku in the Japanese myths and creation of Japan will be treated. </p>
<p>See the article of Tenchi Kaibyaku (China) to know Tenchi Kaibyaku in the Chinese myths, and see the article of the Creation to know about Genesis in the Christian Old Testament. </p>
<p>How was our world created?<br/>
It was a big problem to the ancient people, too. The opening parts of "Kojiki" (The Records of Ancient Matters) and "Nihonshoki" are tales which tell us around the time when the world was born. However, the contents of "Kojiki" and "Nihonshoki" are quite different. Furthermore, "Nihonshoki" contains a different tale called 'arufumi' (alternate writing) in addition to the tale called 'honjo' (the main text). So there are several myths about the birth of this world. </p>
<p>Summary<br/>
"Kojiki"<br/>
According to "Kojiki," the time when the world was just created was as follows. Ame Tsuchi no hajime no toki' (when the heaven and earth) in the opening line of "Kojiki" refers to the time when the heaven and the earth first appeared, and it does not tell how they were created. Speaking of the scene of Tenchi Kaibyaku in the Japanese mythology, it generally refers to this scene of "Kojiki" after the modern times. For the detail about 'Tenchi Kaibyaku' in the study of mythology, see the next article of "Tenchi Kaibyaku" (Japanese mythology). </p>
<p>At the beginning of the world, three gods (The Three Gods of Creation) were born one after another in Takamanohara (plain of high heaven). </p>
<p>Ame no Minakanushi no Kami<br/>
Takami Musuhi no Kami<br/>
Kami Musuhi no Kami<br/>
Then another two gods were born. </p>
<p>Umashi ashikabi hikoji no Kami<br/>
Ame no Tokotachi no Kami<br/>
These five gods did not have certain sex, and they hide away without getting married and giving birth to children. Therefore they did not visibly appear in the myth, but they were special gods that had fundamental influences. That is why they are called Koto Amatsu Kami (Separate heavenly kami). </p>
<p>Then another two gods were born. </p>
<p>Kuni no Tokotachi no Kami (eternal god of the land)<br/>
Toyokumo no Kami<br/>
Kuni no Tokotachi no Kami and Toyokumo no Kami also did not have sex, and they did not appear in the myth after that. </p>
<p>Subsequently, 10 gods of five pairs were born. These five pairs of gods were couples of male and female gods respectively, and in the following list, the left is a male god, and the right is a female god. </p>
<p>Uhijini no Kami, Suhijini no Kami<br/>
Tsunoguhi no Kami, Ikuguhi no Kami<br/>
Otoji no Kami, Otonobe no Kami<br/>
Omodaru no Kami, Ayakashikone no Kami<br/>
Izanagi no Kami, Izanami no Kami<br/>
These 12 gods of seven pairs previously mentioned are generically called Kaminoyo Nanayo (seven generations of the gods' world, The Primordial Seven). </p>
<p>"Nihonshoki"<br/>
Tenchi Kaibyaku in "Nihonshoki" tells us how the world was created; chaos was separated into light and darkness to become the heaven and the earth. The following scene is that gods without sex appear (the first section of the First Volume), and then male and female gods appear (the second and the third sections of the Volume First Volume). As it was previously mentioned, the contents are quite different from those of Kojiki. Moreover, different tales also exist. </p>
<p>Appearance of the gods of the foundation of the land<br/>
According to the "Nihonshoki," in ancient times, the heaven and the earth were not separated, and they were mixed together, being in a state of chaos. From the chaotic state, however, immaculate things went up and became the heaven, while heavy and muddy things became the earth. Then gods were born among them. </p>
<p>Something like reeds were generated in the heaven and the earth. They became gods. </p>

These gods did not have sex. </p>

The following three gods were born in Takamanohara after these two gods. </p>

<p>Commentary<br/>
Names of gods<br/>
</p>
<p>Influence of Chinese Thought<br/>
The opening line of "Nihonshoki," 'Long, long ago, when the heaven and the earth were not separated yet, and light and darkness were not distinguished...' was derived from 'The heaven and the earth were not separated yet; light and darkness were not distinguished yet; the four seasons were not separated yet; all things were not generated yet....' of a Chinese classic, "Huainanzi" (The Masters/Philosophers of Huainan). </p>
