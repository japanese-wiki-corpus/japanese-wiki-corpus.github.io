<h1>Yomogiu (A Wasteland of Weeds) (蓬生)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Yomogiu is one of the 54 chapters of "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/The Tale of Genji.html">The Tale of Genji</a>." It is the 15th chapter. The title of this chapter is derived from the mugwort that had taken over <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Suetsumuhana (The Tale of Genji).html">Suetsumuhana</a>'s ruined residence. </p>
<p>Summary<br/>
This chapter covers the period from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Hikaru Genji.html">Hikaru Genji</a>'s confinement at Suma to his return to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. </p>
<p>Genji was driven away from the capital, and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Suetsumuhana (The Tale of Genji).html">Suetsumuhana</a>, having lost her guardian, was left destitute. The residence fell into ruin and her maids left, so her aunt, who was a wife of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Zuryo (The Head of The Provincial Governors).html">zuryo</a> (the head of the provincial governors), tried to take in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Suetsumuhana (The Tale of Genji).html">Suetsumuhana</a> as her daughter's court lady, but she would not accept the offer. After a while, Genji returned to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> but, as before, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Suetsumuhana (The Tale of Genji).html">Suetsumuhana</a> was left alone, overcome with grief. Before long, her aunt's husband became Senior Assistant Governor-General of Kyushu, and her aunt took the wet nurse whom <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Suetsumuhana (The Tale of Genji).html">Suetsumuhana</a> depended on with her as housekeeper. </p>
<p>The new year came and then spring; when Genji went out to visit <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Hanachirusato.html">Hanachirusato</a> one night, he noticed that the devastated residence which he saw on his way was Hitachinomiya's. He sent Koremitsu to the residence, and found out that <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Suetsumuhana (The Tale of Genji).html">Suetsumuhana</a> was still waiting for him. Genji, who was deeply touched, visited her. Genji began to take care of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Suetsumuhana (The Tale of Genji).html">Suetsumuhana</a> again, promising that he would protect her for many more years, and two years later he took her in to the east lodge at Nijo. </p>
