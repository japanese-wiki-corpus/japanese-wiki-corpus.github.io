<h1>Domyo (道命)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Domyo (974-July 26, 1020) was a priest and poet in the mid-Heian period. His father was FUJIWARA no Michitsuna. His mother was the daughter of MINAMOTO no Chikahiro. He was regarded as one of the medieval 36 Immortal Poets. </p>
<p>In his earlier years he entered the priesthood and became a disciple of Ryogen, the head priest of Tendai Buddhism. He had a voice for the recitation of sutras. In 1016 he became Betto (Secretary) of the Tendai-ji Temple. As a friend of the Retired Emperor Kazan, he composed a eulogy lamenting his demise. A tale in 'Uji Shui Monogatari' (Tales from the Later Gleanings of Uji) tells us that he had an intimate relationship with Izumi SHIKIBU. </p>
<p>His verses were included in the imperial anthologies from 'Goshui Wakashu' (Later Collection of Gleanings of Japanese Poetry) onwards. He compiled the private anthology 'Domyo Ajari-shu' (the Selected Verses of Master Domyo). </p>
