<h1>Shune (俊恵)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Shune (1113 - ca. 1191) was a priest and poet in the late Heian period. His father was MINAMOTO no Toshiyori. His mother was the daughter of TACHIBANA no Atsutaka. He became a priest at the Todai-ji Temple at an early age and was called Shune-hoshi (Shune the Priest). He frequently hosted poetry gatherings and contests at his residence named 'Karin-en,' inviting a number of poets like FUJIWARA no Kiyosuke, MINAMOTO no Yorimasa, and INBUNMONIN no Taifu (Daifu). He thus greatly inspired the world of poetry. </p>
<p>His poems were included in the imperial anthologies from 'Shika Wakashu' (the Collection of Verbal Flowers) onwards. He compiled some anthologies like 'Kaensho' and 'Karinsho' as well as 'Rinyo Wakashu,' a collection of his own verses. </p>
