<h1>Kotokunikyo ki (言国卿記)</h1>
<p>Kotokunikyo ki is a diary of Kotokuni YAMASHINA, a court noble in the Muromachi period. It covers about 30 years from 1474 to 1502. Although a part of the diary is missing, it is an important historical material to know the movement of the Muromachi bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun), Imperial court, and Kyoto during the Onin War. The diary also contains records concerning music and riots. And it has a description about a picture sugoroku (a game similar to backgammon) too. This diary was collected in the book of "Shiryo Sanshu" (Collected Historical Materials). </p>
