<h1>Ryozen (良暹)</h1>
<p>Ryozen (dates of birth and death unknown) was a monk and a poet who lived during the mid-Heian period. </p>
<p>His origin and personal history are unknown, but it is said that he was a monk on Mt. Hiei (the Tendai Sect), who also served as betto (administrator) at Gion. Then, he is said to have retired to Ohara and lived in Urin-in Temple in his later years. According to one theory, he died around the age of sixty-five during the Kohei era (1058-1065). </p>
<p>His poet friends were KAMO no Narisuke, TSUMORI no Kunimoto, TACHIBANA no Tamenaka, and Soi Hoshi (priest). He joined several uta-awase (poetry contest) such as 'Gon Dainagon (chief councilor of state) Morofusa Family Uta-awase' held in September 1038. He apparently made a personal collection of poetry called 'Ryozen Uchigiki,' but it does not exist at the present time. </p>
<p>His poems were collected in the 'Goshui Wakashu' (Later Collection of Gleanings of Japanese Poetry) and other Chokusen Wakashu (anthology of Japanese poetry compiled by the Imperial command). </p>
