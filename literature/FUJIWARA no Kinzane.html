<h1>FUJIWARA no Kinzane (藤原公実)</h1>
<p>FUJIWARA no Kinzane (1053 - December 29, 1107) was a court noble and poet of Heian period. He ended his career as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Dainagon (chief councilor of state).html">Dainagon</a> (chief councilor of state), senior second rank, and was known as Sanjo <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Dainagon (chief councilor of state).html">Dainagon</a> (chief councilor of state). He was the oldest son of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Sanesue.html">FUJIWARA no Sanesue</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Dainagon (chief councilor of state).html">Dainagon</a> (chief councilor of state), and his mother was the daughter of FUJIWARA no Tsunehira. He was also the great‐great‐grandson of the ancestor of the Kaninke, the grand minister of state <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Kinsue.html">FUJIWARA no Kinsue</a>. Among his brothers and sisters were FUJIWARA no Yasuzane, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Nakazane.html">FUJIWARA no Nakazane</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Ishi.html">FUJIWARA no Ishi</a> (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Horikawa.html">Emperor Horikawa</a>'s concubine and mother of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Toba.html">Emperor Toba</a>). Because Emperor <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Shirakawa (the surroundings of the old capital, Kyoto).html">Shirakawa</a> was his cousin, he was deeply trusted by the Imperial Court and served <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Horikawa.html">Emperor Horikawa</a> as a trusted vassal, while his wife <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Mitsuko.html">FUJIWARA no Mitsuko</a> served as a wet nurse for the emperors Horikawa and Toba. He was also very active in poetry circles, composing a poem for the imperial collection of 1105, "Horikawa-in On-toki Hyakushu Waka" (Horikawa Hundred Poems); additionally, his poem was chosen for the Goshui wakashu, the fourth imperial anthology of waka poetry, which was edited while he was still alive. There is also a private collection called "Kinzane Shu" (which exists as fragments). </p>
<p>According to an anecdote told about Kinzane, when his nephew acceded to the throne as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Toba.html">Emperor Toba</a> in 1107, Kinzane insisted that, as the father of the young Emperor's wife, he himself should become the emperor's <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Regent.html">regent</a> rather than the head of the Fujiwara <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Regent.html">regent</a>'s line, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Tadazane.html">FUJIWARA no Tadazane</a> (who he despised for his youth), but MINAMOTO no Toshiakira, the superintendant of the court of the retired Emperor <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Shirakawa (the surroundings of the old capital, Kyoto).html">Shirakawa</a>, refused his demand, saying, 'How foolish you are to desire to become <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Regent.html">regent</a> now, having held the rank of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shodaibu (aristocracy lower than Kugyo).html">shodaibu</a> through four generations of emperors.'<br/>
However, Kinzane's power and influence were directly reflected in the success of his children （<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Saneyuki SANJO.html">Saneyuki SANJO</a> became the grand minister of state, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Saneyoshi TOKUDAIJI.html">Saneyoshi TOKUDAIJI</a> became the minister of the right and the youngest daughter, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Shoshi.html">FUJIWARA no Shoshi</a>, became the empress to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Toba.html">Emperor Toba</a>). Kinzane was also the common ancestor of three of the nine Seiga court families: the Sanjo family, the Saionji family and the Tokudaiji family. </p>
