<h1>Hanachirusato (花散里)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Hanachirusato is<br/>
one of the chapter titles of Genji <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Monogatari.html">Monogatari</a> (The tale of Genji). It is the 11th Chapter. This is the shortest chapter in the novel. The chapter name is derived from the poem <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Hikaru Genji.html">Hikaru Genji</a> composed, "It catches the scent of memory, and favors the village where the orange blossoms fall." </p>
<p>She is a fictional character who appears in Genji <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Monogatari.html">Monogatari</a>. </p>
<p>It came to be one of the score names of such traditional performing arts as koawase (incense-smelling game) and kisenryu-tosenkyo no meitei (rating of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kisen.html">kisen</a> style fan-tossing game). </p>
<p><h3>Story line</h3>
</p>
<p>It is set in the summer when <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Hikaru Genji.html">Hikaru Genji</a> was 25 years old. </p>
<p>In the early summer rainy season, Genji visited Reikeiden no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Nyogo (rank of court lady).html">nyogo</a> (Lady Reikeiden), one of the Empresses of the late Kiritsubotei (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Emperor Kiritsubo.html">Emperor Kiritsubo</a>). Her younger sister, the third daughter Hanachirusato, was Genji's lover, and the sisters lived in obscurity under the Genji's patronage after the Emperor's death. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Hikaru Genji.html">Hikaru Genji</a>, on his way, wrote a poem to a woman of Nakagawa whom he once met, but who gently rejected him, perhaps because she had already changed her mind. At the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Nyogo (rank of court lady).html">Nyogo</a>'s residence filled with the aroma of tachibana (mandarin orange tree) flowers, Genji talked with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Nyogo (rank of court lady).html">Nyogo</a> quietly about the singing of little cuckoos which reminded him of the old days, and later secretly visited San no kimi. <h3>Personal profile</h3>
</p>
<p>She was one of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Hikaru Genji.html">Hikaru Genji</a>'s wives. She made her first appearance in the Chapter of "Hanachirusato" and her name came from the aforementioned Waka poem, from which the chapter name was derived. Genji's father's Reikeiden no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Nyogo (rank of court lady).html">nyogo</a>, Kiritsubotei was her elder sister and seems to have been associated with Genji from her earlier years. She was not so good looking but had a gentle and modest nature, was of high birth, and was good at sewing and dyeing. She came to have the next highest position after <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Murasaki no ue.html">Murasaki no ue</a> among Genji's wives. </p>
<p>At first, she was one of Genji's lovers, but was later received into the west annex of the newly built Nijohigashi no in ("<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Matsukaze (The Tale of Genji).html">Matsukaze</a>," Genji <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Monogatari.html">Monogatari</a>), and after Rokujo in was built, became the lady of Natsu no machi (the rooms called 'summer town') and also was called "Natsu no onkata" (lady of summer town) or "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Higashi (dry sweets; dry confectionary).html">Higashi</a> no onkata" (lady of eastern Rokujo in, or "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Otome (The Tale of Genji).html">Otome</a>" in Genji <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Monogatari.html">Monogatari</a>). Although her marital affairs with Genj ended early on, she won his confidence due to her home-oriented and trustworthy personality, and reared <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Yugiri (The Tale of Genji).html">Yugiri</a> (Genji <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Monogatari.html">Monogatari</a>) and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Tamakazura (The Tale of Genji).html">Tamakazura</a> (Genji <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Monogatari.html">Monogatari</a>) functioning as their mother, and later took in one of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Yugiri (The Tale of Genji).html">Yugiri</a>'s children and nurtured the child as her grandchild. She exited from the story with the final appearance in the "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Maboroshi (The Wizard) (The Tale of Genji).html">Maboroshi</a>" (Genji <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Monogatari.html">Monogatari</a>) chapter, and after Genj's death, inherited his Nijohigashi no in and moved into it again ("Nioumiya"). </p>
