<h3>Major poems</h3>
</p>
<p>In the early summer rain, the clouds are hanging low, and is a little cuckoo crying pitifully for the gloomy feelings ("<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Shoku Shui Wakashu.html">Shoku Shui Wakashu</a>" (12th imperial anthology)). 
<br/>Plume grasses in ears are wet in Irino into which bucks came in the evening, is this because the bucks' tears fell onto them? ("<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Shoku Shui Wakashu.html">Shoku Shui Wakashu</a>" (12th imperial anthology))<br/>
I didn't have a chance to see you, and wasted my days, burning myself on love's flame ("<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Shoku Shui Wakashu.html">Shoku Shui Wakashu</a>" (12th imperial anthology)). </p>
