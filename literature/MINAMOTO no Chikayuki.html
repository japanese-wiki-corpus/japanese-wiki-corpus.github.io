<p>In the early summer rain, the clouds are hanging low, and is a little cuckoo crying pitifully for the gloomy feelings ("Shoku Shui Wakashu" (12th imperial anthology)). 
<br/>Plume grasses in ears are wet in Irino into which bucks came in the evening, is this because the bucks' tears fell onto them? ("Shoku Shui Wakashu" (12th imperial anthology))<br/>
I didn't have a chance to see you, and wasted my days, burning myself on love's flame ("Shoku Shui Wakashu" (12th imperial anthology)). </p>
