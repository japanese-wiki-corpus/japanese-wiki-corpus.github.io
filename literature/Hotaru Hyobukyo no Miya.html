<p>He was famous as a man of refined taste at the time, so he played the role of judge in '<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Eawase.html">Eawase</a>' (A Picture Contest) and '<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Umegae (The Plum Tree Branch).html">Umegae</a>' (The Plum Tree Branch), and often appeared in scenes of court music performance.
