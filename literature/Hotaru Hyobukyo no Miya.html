<p></p>
<p><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Hotaru (The Tale of Genji).html">Hotaru</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Hyobukyo no Miya.html">Hyobukyo no Miya</a> is a fictitious character in "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/The Tale of Genji.html">The Tale of Genji</a>" written by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Murasaki Shikibu.html">Murasaki Shikibu</a> (note that he is not the same person as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Hyobukyo no Miya.html">Hyobukyo no Miya</a>, an elder brother of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Fujitsubo.html">Fujitsubo</a>). 
<br/>The name of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Hotaru (The Tale of Genji).html">Hotaru</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Hyobukyo no Miya.html">Hyobukyo no Miya</a> comes from the fact that he is a main character of the chapter '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Hotaru (The Tale of Genji).html">Hotaru</a> (Firefly).'<br/>
</p>
<p>He was a prince of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Emperor Kiritsubo.html">Emperor Kiritsubo</a> and a younger paternal brother of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Emperor Suzaku.html">Emperor Suzaku</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Hikaru Genji.html">Hikaru Genji</a> (thus he was probably the third prince). He appeared as Sochi no Miya in the chapter '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Hana no En.html">Hana no En</a>' (The Festival of the Cherry Blossoms) and then was appointed to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Hyobukyo no Miya.html">Hyobukyo no Miya</a> after <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Fujitsubo.html">Fujitsubo</a>'s brother was appointed to Shikibukyo no Miya in the chapter '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Otome (The Tale of Genji).html">Otome</a>' (The Maidens). </p>
<p>He was famous as a man of refined taste at the time, so he played the role of judge in '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Eawase.html">Eawase</a>' (A Picture Contest) and '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Umegae (The Plum Tree Branch).html">Umegae</a>' (The Plum Tree Branch), and often appeared in scenes of court music performance. He was close to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Hikaru Genji.html">Hikaru Genji</a> in particular among his brothers and he stayed in touch with Genji during his dark days (chapter 'Suma'), and never ceased to be a friend of Genji. </p>
<p>His first legal wife was a daughter of the Minister of the Right to the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Emperor Kiritsubo.html">Emperor Kiritsubo</a> (and a sister of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Lady Kokiden.html">Lady Kokiden</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Oborozukiyo (The Tale of Genji).html">Oborozukiyo</a>; therefore <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Tono Chujo (a government post).html">Tono Chujo</a> was his brother-in-law), but he lost his wife early. He stayed single for a while until he proposed to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Tamakazura (The Tale of Genji).html">Tamakazura</a>, an adopted daughter of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Hikaru Genji.html">Hikaru Genji</a>, in the chapter '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kocho (The Tale of Genji).html">Kocho</a>' (Butterflies). In a well-known episode in the chapter '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Hotaru (The Tale of Genji).html">Hotaru</a>,' he was tricked by Genji to see bewitching <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Tamakazura (The Tale of Genji).html">Tamakazura</a>, with whom he kept communicating by mail, but his love for her was lost because Higekuro married <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Tamakazura (The Tale of Genji).html">Tamakazura</a>. Later he became a candidate for the husband of Onna Sannomiya (the Third Princess) but he failed again, so he ended up marrying <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Makibashira (The Cypress Pillar).html">Makibashira</a> (Higekuro's daughter and Shikibukyo no Miya's granddaughter), but their marriage didn't go well (chapter '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Wakana (new herbs) (The Tale of Genji).html">Wakana</a>' (New Herbs): Part One). His last appearance was in the chapter '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Maboroshi (The Wizard) (The Tale of Genji).html">Maboroshi</a>' (The Wizard) when he visited <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Hikaru Genji.html">Hikaru Genji</a> who was broken-hearted after his wife Lady Murasaki's death; in the chapter '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kobai (The Rose Plum) (The Tale of Genji).html">Kobai</a>' (the rose plum) it was mentioned that <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Hotaru (The Tale of Genji).html">Hotaru</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Hyobukyo no Miya.html">Hyobukyo no Miya</a> had already been dead. </p>
<p>He had two sons (appeared in chapter '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Wakana (new herbs) (The Tale of Genji).html">Wakana</a>' (New Herbs): Part Two and their mother unknown) and a daughter (Miya no Onkata; her mother was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Makibashira (The Cypress Pillar).html">Makibashira</a>. Appeared in '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kobai (The Rose Plum) (The Tale of Genji).html">Kobai</a>'). Although he loved his first wife and missed her after her death, he seemed to have many other women to visit and mistresses ('<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kocho (The Tale of Genji).html">Kocho</a>'). </p>
