<h1>Okanoya Kanpakuki (The Dairy of Okanoya Kanpaku) (岡屋関白記)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Okanoya Kanpakuki is a diary written by Kanpaku (Chancellor) <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kanetsune KONOE.html">Kanetsune KONOE</a> in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period. </p>
<p>Its title derives from the fact that Kanetsune lived in his villa, in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Uji City.html">Uji City</a>, called 'Okanoya-dono.'<br/>
The manuscripts of the diary which originally covered the period between 1222 and 1251 have been almost completely dispersed, now reduced to a small portion of the original text. The remaining portion written by Kanetsune himself is only the section on spring 1249, which is housed in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Yomei Bunko Library.html">Yomei Bunko Library</a>. The section on winter 1232 has been assumed to refer to the abdication of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Gohorikawa.html">Emperor Gohorikawa</a>. </p>
