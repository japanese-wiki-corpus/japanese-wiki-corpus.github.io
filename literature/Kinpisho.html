<p>Summary<br/>
The author, Emperor Juntoku (1197 - 1242), was born the third prince of Emperor Gotoba. 
<br/>From a young age Emperor Juntoku enjoyed learning; he also excelled in waka poetry and compiled various waka anthologies and research documents on waka, such as 'Yakumomisho.'<br/>
Kinpisho was an in-depth study of the root and origin of manners and etiquette of ceremonies performed at the Imperial Court, with an intent to pass the ancient customs down to succeeding generations. As revealed by the outbreak of the Jokyu War immediately after the completion of the book, there was a profound yearning for the restoration of the Imperial government and to pass the way of the sovereign down to the princes of the next generation. </p>
