<h1>FUJIWARA no Sadakata (藤原定方)</h1>
<p>FUJIWARA no Sadakata (873 - September 11, 932) was a court noble and poet who lived from the beginning through the middle of the Heian period. </p>
<p>His father was <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/FUJIWARA no Takafuji.html">FUJIWARA no Takafuji</a>, who was posthumously raised to the rank of High Chancellor (Sadakata was his second son). His mother was MIYAJI no Resshi. His own mother also gave birth to a girl, his sister <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/FUJIWARA no Inshi.html">FUJIWARA no Inshi</a> (who was a lady-in-waiting for <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Uda.html">Emperor Uda</a>, and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Daigo.html">Emperor Daigo</a>'s birth mother). Sadakata's wife was the daughter of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/FUJIWARA no Yamakage.html">FUJIWARA no Yamakage</a>. He had several children, including <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/FUJIWARA no Asatada.html">FUJIWARA no Asatada</a>, FUJIWARA no Asahira, FUJIWARA no <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Noshi.html">Noshi</a> (a lady-in-waiting to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Daigo.html">Emperor Daigo</a> and wife to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/FUJIWARA no Saneyori.html">FUJIWARA no Saneyori</a>), Prince Yoshiakira, and daughters that married <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/FUJIWARA no Kanesuke.html">FUJIWARA no Kanesuke</a> and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/FUJIWARA no Morotada.html">FUJIWARA no Morotada</a>. </p>
<p>Beginning in 892, when he was made an Unoderi (an officer of the Central Secretariat), he steadily rose in rank; in 895 he was made a third-rank official of the province of Mutsu, and the following year was made the surrogate <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a> (de facto governor) of Owari Province, an <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Appointment (Ninkan).html">appointment</a> of Jugoinoge (Junior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade). And in the year after that, he added to his titles by being promoted to Sakone no Shosho (Major-General o the Imperial Left Guard).

On the tenth day of the eighth month, he was posthumously raised to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Juichii.html">Juichii</a> (Junior First Rank). His residence was on Sanjo Avenue in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, which is why he came to be called Sanjo <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Udaijin (Minister of the Right).html">Udaijin</a>. </p>
<p>Skilled at waka poetry and musical composition, he was a major patron of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/KI no Tsurayuki.html">KI no Tsurayuki</a> and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/OSHIKOCHI no Mitsune.html">OSHIKOCHI no Mitsune</a>. </p>
