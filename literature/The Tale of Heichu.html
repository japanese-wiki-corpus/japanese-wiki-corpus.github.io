<h1>The Tale of Heichu (平中物語)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Heichu <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Monogatari.html">monogatari</a> (The Tale of Heichu) (written 平中物語 or 平仲物語) is a story told through poems that was completed during the Heian period. The author and year of completion are unknown. The only existing copy is a reprint made by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Tamesuke REIZEI.html">Tamesuke REIZEI</a>, a grandson of FUJIWARA no Teika. The main character, 'Heichu,' is a mid-Heian period poet named TAIRA no Sadabumi (or Sadabun). The story was greatly influenced by "Ise <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Monogatari.html">monogatari</a>" (The Tales of Ise), but has a comparatively longer main text. Available as part of the Kadokawa Bunko books or in the Nihon Koten Bungaku <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Zenshu.html">Zenshu</a> (The Collections of Japanese Classical Literature). </p>
