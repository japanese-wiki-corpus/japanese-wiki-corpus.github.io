<h1>Nowaki (The Tale of Genji) (野分 (源氏物語))</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Nowaki (The Typhoon) is one of the 54 chapters of "The Tale of Genji." It is the 28th chapter. </p>
<p>Summary<br/>
This chapter takes place in the autumn when Hikaru Genji was 36. </p>
<p>One day in August, the capital was hit by a powerful typhoon. On a visit to the Rokujo-in Palace, where plants and flowers in the garden had been blown flat, Yugiri happened to catch a glimpse of Murasaki no Ue amidst the chaos and was stunned by her beauty. Even after paying a visit to his grandmother, Omiya, he could not forget the Murasaki no Ue's beauty, which was like full-blown cherry blossoms. </p>
<p>The day after the typhoon, Genji and Yugiri went visit Empress Akikonomu, who was in the middle of a short leave, and other noble ladies. When they visited Tamakazura, Yugiri caught a glimpse of her and was fascinated by her beauty but, at the same time, he was suspicious of Genji's unfatherly-like behavior toward her. Yugiri, disconcerted by the various women as beautiful as flowers, sent Kumoi no Kari a letter. </p>
