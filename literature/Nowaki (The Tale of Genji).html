<h1>Nowaki (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/The Tale of Genji.html">The Tale of Genji</a>) (野分 (源氏物語))</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Nowaki (The Typhoon) is one of the 54 chapters of "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/The Tale of Genji.html">The Tale of Genji</a>." It is the 28th chapter. </p>
<p>Summary<br/>
This chapter takes place in the autumn when <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Hikaru Genji.html">Hikaru Genji</a> was 36. </p>
<p>One day in August, the capital was hit by a powerful typhoon. On a visit to the Rokujo-in Palace, where plants and flowers in the garden had been blown flat, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Yugiri (The Tale of Genji).html">Yugiri</a> happened to catch a glimpse of Murasaki no Ue amidst the chaos and was stunned by her beauty. Even after paying a visit to his grandmother, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Omiya (The Tale of Genji).html">Omiya</a>, he could not forget the Murasaki no Ue's beauty, which was like full-blown cherry blossoms. </p>
<p>The day after the typhoon, Genji and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Yugiri (The Tale of Genji).html">Yugiri</a> went visit Empress Akikonomu, who was in the middle of a short leave, and other noble ladies. When they visited <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Tamakazura (The Tale of Genji).html">Tamakazura</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Yugiri (The Tale of Genji).html">Yugiri</a> caught a glimpse of her and was fascinated by her beauty but, at the same time, he was suspicious of Genji's unfatherly-like behavior toward her. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Yugiri (The Tale of Genji).html">Yugiri</a>, disconcerted by the various women as beautiful as flowers, sent Kumoi no Kari a letter. </p>
