<p><h3>Career</h3>
</p>
<p>He was a musician who attended the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Horikawa.html">Emperor Horikawa</a> first, and later played a leading role in Horikawain's poetry circle. He took part in a lot of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Uta-awase.html">uta-awase</a> (poetry contests) both as a composer and as a judge, and also planned and promoted "Horikawain Hyakushu" (Horikawa Hundred-Poem Sequences). In 1124, he compiled "Kinyo wakashu" under the order of Shirakawain. He and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/FUJIWARA no Mototoshi.html">FUJIWARA no Mototoshi</a> were the leading figures in the waka circles of the time. He was famous for his innovative poetical style. </p>
<p>Approximately 200 poems of his were selected for "Kinyo wakashu" and other Chokusen wakashu (anthologies of Japanese poetry compiled by Imperial command) afterwards. <h3>Waka poetry</h3>

I did pray to the Kannon (Deity of Mercy) at Hatsuse that the person who was hard on me would give her heart, but oh, strong wind blowing from Hatsuse, I did not pray that she would become harsher like you.

<p>As a calligrapher<br/>
</p>
<p>He is known as a distinguished waka poet, but there are no records of him as a famed calligrapher. However, both his father Tsunenobu and his son <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Shune.html">Shune</a> were good calligraphers, and there are many ancient pieces of Japanese calligraphy said to have been written by Toshiyori. 
<br/>Some of his most famous writings are as follows:<br/>
</p>
<p>"Kokinshu" (abbreviation of "Collection of Ancient and Modern Poems"), kansubon (book in scroll style)<br/>
"Kokinshu" (abbreviation of "Collection of Ancient and Modern Poems"), Genei-bon manuscript<br/>
