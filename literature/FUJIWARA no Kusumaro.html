<h1>FUJIWARA no Kusumaro (藤原訓儒麻呂)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>FUJIWARA no Kusumaro (year of birth unknown - October 14, 764) was a court noble during the Nara period. He was the third son of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Nakamaro.html">FUJIWARA no Nakamaro</a> (though there are incorrect assertions that he was the oldest son). His mother was FUJIWARA no Ohira (the daughter of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Fusasaki.html">FUJIWARA no Fusasaki</a>). He was married to KAZURA no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Okimi (great king) (Yamato sovereignty).html">Okimi</a> (Prince Mishima's daughter) and had a son named FUJIWARA no Mioka. EMI no Kusumaro. His first name 訓儒麻呂 (Kusumaro) is also written as 久須麻呂. </p>
<p>His father Nakamaro, having the confidence of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Empress Komyo.html">Empress Komyo</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Empress Koken.html">Empress Koken</a>, was known to have wielded great political influence. </p>
<p>In February 758, Kusumaro was appointed to Momikushi (a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ritsuryo.html">Ritsuryo</a> version of an ombudsman) for <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Tokaido.html">Tokaido</a> and Tosando Roads. After Emperor Kenko's abdication of the throne in September of the same year, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Prince Oi.html">Prince Oi</a> ascended to the throne (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Junnin.html">Emperor Junnin</a>) upon Nakamaro's recommendation. Nakamaro was appointed to Taiho (Minister of the Right) and given the name EMI no Oshikatsu. Kusumaro was also promoted to Jugoinoge (Junior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade) Shikibu shoyu (Junior Assistant of the Ministry of Ceremonial). In 759, he was appointed to Mino no kuni <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kokushi.html">Kokushi</a> (Governor of Mino Province) and promoted to Jushiinoge (Junior Forth Rank, Lower Grade). </p>
<p>In 760, Nakamaro was appointed to Taishi (Grand Minister). In 761, Kusumaro was appointed to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yamato.html">Yamato</a> no kuni no kami (Governor of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yamato Province.html">Yamato Province</a>). In August 762, Kusumaro served in Chuguin Palace (the residence of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Junnin.html">Emperor Junnin</a>) and issued an imperial order. At the time, he was sayu keiin (Mayor of the Right and Left Capital districts). In December of the same year, Kusumaro was appointed to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Sangi.html">Sangi</a> (councilor) together with his brothers, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Masaki.html">FUJIWARA no Masaki</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Asakari.html">FUJIWARA no Asakari</a>. In 763, he also served as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Tanba (train).html">Tanba</a> no kuni no kami (Governor of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Tanba Province.html">Tanba Province</a>). </p>
<p>Nakamaro's family dominated the highest ranking positions and was surrounded by wealth and power until the Retired <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Empress Koken.html">Empress Koken</a> began to favor <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Dokyo.html">Dokyo</a>. Nakamaro, through <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Junnin.html">Emperor Junnin</a>, remonstrated with the Retired <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Empress Koken.html">Empress Koken</a> on her favor towards <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Dokyo.html">Dokyo</a>, but she eventually stripped all power away from the emperor. As Retired <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Empress Koken.html">Empress Koken</a>'s favoritism toward <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Dokyo.html">Dokyo</a> further deepened, Nakamaro sensed his political influence was in danger. </p>
<p>In October 764, Nakamaro attempted a rebellion with the military power he amassed by becoming totoku (Governor General) and Military Chief of Shikinai (four provinces close to the Capital <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>; <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yamato.html">Yamato</a>, Yamashiro, Settsu, Kawachi), <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Sangen (three major checkpoints).html">Sangen</a> (three major barrier stations), Omi, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Tanba (train).html">Tanba</a>, Harima and other provinces, but was foiled by an anonymous report. On October 14, the Retired <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Empress Koken.html">Empress Koken</a> quickly moved to send <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shonagon (Post in Daijokan).html">Shonagon</a> (lesser councilor of state) Yamamura-O to the Chuguin Palace to collect the Imperial Seal and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ekirei.html">ekirei</a> (bell) that were needed to exercise imperial power. Upon this news, Nakamaro ordered Kusumaro, who served in the Chuguin Palace, to recover these items. Kusumaro attacked Yamamura-O during his return trip and recovered the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ekirei.html">ekirei</a>. The Retired Emperor Koken immediately sent Jr. Lieutenant <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/SAKANOUE no Karitamaro.html">SAKANOUE no Karitamaro</a> and Shoso OSHIKA no Shimatari of Jyutoei (Division of Inner Palace Guards). In the battle between Kusumaro's men and Karitamaro's army, Kusumaro was shot to death. </p>
<p>After that, Nakamaro led his family and escaped from the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Heijo-kyo.html">Heijo-kyo</a> (the ancient capital of Japan in current Nara). They lost battles in various locations and finally retreated to an old castle in Sanbi, Takashima County, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Omi Province.html">Omi Province</a>, where their resistance proved futile, resulting in the collapse of the Nakamaro family (Rebellion of Fujiwara no Nakamaro). </p>
