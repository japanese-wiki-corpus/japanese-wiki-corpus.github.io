<h1>Nijoin no Sanuki (二条院讃岐)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Nijoin no Sanuki (Sanuki of Nijoin, ca. 1141 - ca. 1217) was a poetess of the late Heian and the early <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period. She is also called Uchi-Sanuki or Chugu Sanuki. Her father was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Yorimasa.html">MINAMOTO no Yorimasa</a> and her mother was the daughter of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Masayori.html">MINAMOTO no Masayori</a>. </p>
<p>She served the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Nijo.html">Emperor Nijo</a> (Nijoin), and after his death she married FUJIWARA no Shigeyori. 
<br/>By then she already had a good reputation as a poetess, and she was selected for 'kasen rakugaki.'<br/>
In around 1190, she returned to court to attend the Emperor Gotoba's empress, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Ninshi KUJO.html">Ninshi KUJO</a> (Gishumonin), but later she became a Buddhist nun. Even after she became a nun, she was welcomed by the waka circles of the Retired Emperor Gotoba and of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Juntoku.html">Emperor Juntoku</a>. Some of her poems were selected for the '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Shoji (Paper Sliding Screen).html">Shoji</a> ninen <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shodo (Daigaku-ryo).html">shodo</a> hyakushu' (Hundred-Poem Sequence of the Shoji Era) and the 'Sengohyaku ban <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Uta-awase.html">Uta-awase</a>' (One thousand and five hundreds Set of Poetry Match). She has a personal collection "Nijoin no Sanuki Shu." </p>
<p>From "Ogura <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Hyakunin Isshu.html">Hyakunin Isshu</a>" (The Ogura Anthology of One Hundred Tanka-poems by One Hundred Poets)<br/>
My sleeves have not a moment to dry, just like the reefs lying offshore that cannot be seen even at low tide, although no one knows about it. </p>
<p>Her nickname 'Oki no ishi no Sanuki' (literally, "Sanuki of the offshore reefs") came from this poem. </p>
<p><h3>The genealogy of 'Yo ni furu'</h3>
</p>
<p>The following poem by Nijoin no Sanuki became the source of one after another poetic allusion:<br/>
Yo ni furu ha Kurushiki mono wo Maki no ya ni Yasukumo suguru Hatsu <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Shigure (a shower of rain in late autumn and early winter)..html">shigure</a> kana<br/>
</p>
<p>It means, 'It is hard to live a life connected with others. When I was thinking about such things on a winter night, the first early winter shower passed by, falling on the yew-thatched roof. 
<br/>How easily the rain passes over the house of those having a difficult time.'<br/>
</p>
<p>When the woman was feeling depressed over her love life, an early winter shower passed her by instead of her lover. </p>
<p>The core of this poem is the use of "furu" that entangles the poem with the atmosphere of a love song.'<br/>
Some say that the above interpretation is shallow, and that 'the heart of the poem' is actually in the comparison between human affairs and nature. </p>
<p>Poems afterwards<br/>
The sounds on the sparse yew-thatched roof shingles might be because of the leaves or an early winter shower that does not leak in.

When I sleep alone on a cold night, small hail falls on the yew-thatched roof shingles as if it were breaking my heart into pieces.
