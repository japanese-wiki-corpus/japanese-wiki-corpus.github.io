<h1>MINAMOTO no Kanemasa (源兼昌)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>MINAMOTO no Kanemasa (year of birth and death unknown) was a poet of the middle to late-Heian period. His father was MINAMOTO no Toshisuke. </p>
<p>He was not so favored with promotions, with his highest position as Jugoinoge (Junior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade), Kogogushiki (the Queen-consort's Household Agency), and later he became a Buddhist monk. Although the year of his death is unknown, he seems to have been still alive in around 1128. Starting with the Kunizane-kyo ke <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Uta-awase.html">uta-awase</a> (poetry contest sponsored by the State Counsellor and Middle Captain Kunizane) in 1100, he contributed poems to poetry contests such as the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Naidaijin (inner minister).html">Naidaijin</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Tadamichi.html">FUJIWARA no Tadamichi</a> ke <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Uta-awase.html">uta-awase</a> (poetry contests sponsored by the Minister of the Palace <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Tadamichi.html">FUJIWARA no Tadamichi</a>) in 1115, 1118, and in 1119, and played a major role in Tadamichi's poetry circle, which was subordinate to the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Horikawa.html">Emperor Horikawa</a>'s poetry circle. He was one of the composers of 'Horikawa Jiro Hyakushu' (the Second Horikawa Hundred-Poem Sequences), which was completed in 1116. </p>
<p>His poetry was selected for Chokusen wakashu (anthologies of Japanese poetry compiled by Imperial command) including "Kinyo wakashu," "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shika.html">Shika</a> wakashu" (Waka Collection of Verbal Flowers), "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Senzai Wakashu.html">Senzai Wakashu</a>" (Collection of Japanese Poems of a Thousand Years), "Shin Chokusen wakashu" (New Imperial Anthology of Japanese Poetry), and "Shin Senzai wakashu" (New Collection of Japanese Poems of a Thousand Years). No personal collection by him has survived today. </p>
