<p><h3>Story line</h3>
</p>
<p>The story was set in around 1950, shortly after the end of the World War II, when Yuko, the daughter of a wood cutter in Tarudomari (樽泊), a poor village in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Tango (the Boys Festival).html">Tango</a>, was voluntarily sold to a red-light district Goban-cho Yugiri-ro in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Nishijin.html">Nishijin</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> to be a prostitute to support her poor father, mother with lung disease, and three younger sisters. Having a patron named Jinzo, a lusting old man who was a textile manufacturer in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Nishijin.html">Nishijin</a>, Yuko became one of the top-selling prostitutes in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Goban-cho (Kyoto City).html">Goban-cho</a> within a year. However, Yuko was in love with her childhood friend from the same village, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Seijun.html">Seijun</a>, a young priest. Jinzo intended to make Yuko his mistress, so he informed a chief priest of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Hokaku-ji Temple.html">Hokaku-ji Temple</a> where <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Seijun.html">Seijun</a> lived in as a trainee that the young priest was visiting the red-light district. Around the same time, Yuko's failing health resulted in lung disease and she was hospitalized. Meanwhile, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Seijun.html">Seijun</a> was disappointed with his training as a priest because high-ranked priests at his temple were playing around extravagantly with donations from the supporters of the temple. One day, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Seijun.html">Seijun</a> quarreled with the chief priest, set fire to the temple out of disappointment and anger, was arrested, and committed suicide. Reading of the incident in the newspaper, Yuko escaped from the hospital to go back to her hometown in Yosa Island where she killed herself following her lover <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Seijun.html">Seijun</a>. </p>
