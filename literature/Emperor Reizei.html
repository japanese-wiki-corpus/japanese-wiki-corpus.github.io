<h1>Emperor Reizei (冷泉帝)</h1>
<p>Emperor Reizei/Reizei-in is the third Emperor in "<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/The Tale of Genji.html">The Tale of Genji</a>" (period of reign: '<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Miotsukushi (The Tale of Genji).html">Miotsukushi</a>' (Channel Buoys) to the second volume of '<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Wakana (new herbs) (The Tale of Genji).html">Wakana</a>' (Spring Shoots), the 18 years of his reign were the golden days of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Hikaru Genji.html">Hikaru Genji</a>). He is a fictitious character. Out of the 54 chapters of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/The Tale of Genji.html">The Tale of Genji</a>, he appears from '<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Momiji no Ga.html">Momiji no Ga</a>' (The Autumn Excursion) to '<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Hashihime (The Tale of Genji).html">Hashihime</a>' (The Maiden of the Bridge). </p>
<p>People considered him to be the tenth prince of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Emperor Kiritsubo.html">Emperor Kiritsubo</a>, but in fact, he was an illegitimate child between <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Hikaru Genji.html">Hikaru Genji</a> and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Fujitsubo.html">Fujitsubo</a>. He became Togu (the Crown Prince) of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Emperor Suzaku.html">Emperor Suzaku</a>, and ascended to the throne at the age of 11. Until he abdicated the throne in favor of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Kinjo no Mikado.html">Kinjo no Mikado</a>, he had ruled the country for 18 years. 
<br/>After his retirement, he lived in Reizei-in (a real Imperial palace for successive ex-emperors), so he is known by the name of 'Emperor Reizei.'<br/>
</p>
<p>After the death of his mother, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Fujitsubo.html">Fujitsubo</a>, he found out about the secret concerning his birth by a priest in yoi (a night-watch duty) and was surprised. He agonized over the fact that he had his father, Genji, in the position of subject, but Genji refused firmly his offer to abdicate the Imperial throne in favor of Genji. After that he tried to discharge his duties to his father, making Genji's adopted daughter, Akikonomu, settle in the position of Empress, and giving him the court rank of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Jun Daijo tenno.html">Jun Daijo tenno</a> (quasi ex-emperor) at Genji's 40th birthday ceremony. </p>
<p>He was a man of refined taste, and especially loved paintings (it is considered that he was given this from his biological father, Genji), which led to his loving Empress Akikonomu. Moreover, he also loved <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Tamakazura (The Tale of Genji).html">Tamakazura</a>, another adopted daughter of Genji. 
<br/>He regretted that she got married to Higekuro right before she served as <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Naishi no tsukasa.html">Naishi no tsukasa</a> (female palace attendants), so after his retirement, he took a daughter of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Tamakazura (The Tale of Genji).html">Tamakazura</a> as his wife and favored her. ('<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Takekawa (Bamboo River).html">Takekawa</a>' (Bamboo River))<br/>
After the death of Genji, he showed special favor to the bereaved <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Kaoru.html">Kaoru</a> as well as the Empress Akikonomu, who did not have a child, in accordance with the will of Genji ('Nioumiya' (His Perfumed Highness)), but he did not know the secret concerning <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Kaoru.html">Kaoru</a>'s birth (therefore he seems to have taken <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Kaoru.html">Kaoru</a> as his younger brother by a different mother). </p>
