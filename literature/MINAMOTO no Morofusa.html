<h1>MINAMOTO no Morofusa (源師房)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>MINAMOTO no Morofusa (1008 - March 20, 1077) was a kuge (court noble) and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Kajin (Waka or Tanka Poets).html">kajin</a> (waka poet) in the mid Heian period. He was a founder of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/family/Murakami-Genji (Minamoto clan).html">Murakami-Genji</a> (Minamoto clan). He was a son of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Imperial Prince Tomohira.html">Imperial Prince Tomohira</a>, the prince of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Murakami.html">Emperor Murakami</a>. He was a Chuinryuso (patriarch of a religious school). He was <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Udaijin (Minister of the Right).html">Udaijin</a> (the Minister of the Right) with <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Juichii.html">Juichii</a> (Junior First Rank). He called himself Tsuchimikado <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Udaijin (Minister of the Right).html">udaijin</a>. His childhood name was Manjunomiya. </p>
<p><h3>Career</h3>
</p>
<p>He was first called (Prince) Sukesada, and after he had lost his father <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Imperial Prince Tomohira.html">Imperial Prince Tomohira</a> early, became a <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Yushi (privately adopted child).html">Yushi</a> (another child considered as one's own) of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/FUJIWARA no Yorimichi.html">FUJIWARA no Yorimichi</a>, who was the husband of his elder sister <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Princess Takahime.html">Princess Takahime</a> (however, at that time, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Yushi (privately adopted child).html">Yushi</a> were considered to be virtually same as an adopted child.)<br/>
He celebrated his attainment of manhood on December 26, 1020, was given the family name Genji, was demoted from nobility to subject, and changed his name to Morofusa. He married <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/FUJIWARA no Takako.html">FUJIWARA no Takako</a>, fifth daughter of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/FUJIWARA no Michinaga.html">FUJIWARA no Michinaga</a> and Yorimichi's half sister) to build a close relationship with the Fujiwara clan, and became <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Udaijin (Minister of the Right).html">udaijin</a> (minister of the right) in 1069 to form a basis for the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/family/Murakami-Genji (Minamoto clan).html">Murakami-Genji</a> to go into politics. He was assigned to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Daijo-daijin (Grand minister of state).html">Daijo-daijin</a> (Grand minister of state) on February 17, 1077, but he became a priest and died on the same day. </p>
<p>While he was highly educated, he was also good at Chinese poetry and waka (a traditional Japanese poem of thirty-one syllables), and ten of his poems were chosen in Chokusen wakashu (anthology of Japanese poetry compiled by Imperial command) including "<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Goshui Wakashu (Later Collection of Gleanings of Japanese Poetry).html">Goshui Wakashu</a>" (4th imperial anthology). His books include "Joijimokusho" and "Doyuki" (diary written by classical Chinese). 
<br/>It is said that, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/FUJIWARA no Michinaga.html">FUJIWARA no Michinaga</a>, who loved Morofusa's talent, said 'I can have Morofusa succeed Sekkan-ke (the families which produced regents) if Yorimichi does not have a boy.'<br/>
<h3>Waka</h3>
</p>
<p>I want to bank up the lower Shirakawa River; spring has gone away with the river water. ("<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Goshui Wakashu (Later Collection of Gleanings of Japanese Poetry).html">Goshui Wakashu</a>," poem number 146)<br/>
I dozed off while I was waiting for the morning moon to only dream of the brow of the hill I was viewing. ("<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Kinyo Wakashu (Kinyo Collection of Japanese Poems).html">Kinyo Wakashu</a>" (Kinyo Collection of Japanese poems), poem number 214)<br/>
