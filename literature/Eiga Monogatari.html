<p></p>
<p>"Eiga <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Monogatari.html">Monogatari</a> (A Tale of Flowering Fortunes)" is a classic work of the Heian period. 
<br/>A kana text<br/>
An annalistic, story-like history written by a woman<br/>
</p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>An historical tale of unknown authorship<br/>
Written with the intention of being a successor to the Six National Histories, it covers approximately 200 years, the reigns of 15 emperors from that of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Uda.html">Emperor Uda</a> up to February 1092 during the reign of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Horikawa.html">Emperor Horikawa</a>, when the Regency government was weakening. It is divided into 30 volumes covering up to the death of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/FUJIWARA no Michinaga.html">FUJIWARA no Michinaga</a>, with a sequel in 10 volumes. </p>
<p>There is a theory that the principal 30 volumes were written by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Akazome Emon.html">Akazome Emon</a> and the 10-volume sequel was written by Idewa no Ben and several women such as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Suo no Naishi.html">Suo no Naishi</a>, but such a claim remains unproven. Undoubtedly, both the principal part (during <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Go-Ichijo.html">Emperor Go-Ichijo</a>'s reign, around 1024 - 1028) and the sequel (from the end of the eleventh century to the beginning of the twelfth century) were written by women at court. In the description of the birth of Prince Atsuhira in the 'First Flower' (Chapter 8) there is a quotation from "Murasaki Shikibu Diary," although it was not quoted verbatim but instead was altered slightly. </p>
<p>While "<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Okagami (The Great Mirror).html">Okagami</a> (The Great Mirror)," a contemporary historical tale written in the style of a biographical record, consistently tells the story from the view of an official (probably a man), the annalistic "Eiga <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Monogatari.html">Monogatari</a>" was written in a woman's hand, and the structures and style were strongly influenced by women's literature such as "<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/The Tale of Genji.html">The Tale of Genji</a>." Things such as giving each chapter an elegant name and praising the glory of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Regent.html">Regent</a>'s Line of the Fujiwara family's Northern House, especially the father Michinaga and his son FUJIWARA Yorimichi, are both expressions of this influence. It is said that a defining characteristic is the admiration seen in the descriptions of Michinaga, but it also clearly shows his suffering due to illness in his later years and even the pains of living in defeat under the Regency government. <h3>Evaluation and Influence</h3>
</p>
<p>Compared to "<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Okagami (The Great Mirror).html">Okagami</a>" (The Great Mirror)," Eiga <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Monogatari.html">Monogatari</a>" has less of a critical spirit, and it treats the narrative as being so important that the descriptions are often inconsistent with history. Also, because it focuses on mastery over the rear palace by the Northern House of the Fujiwara family rather than on politics, the descriptions in the latter part seem like mere lists of facts. For this reason it is outdone by "<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Okagami (The Great Mirror).html">Okagami</a>" both as history and as literature. However, according to Professor Shin'ichi MACHII of Sagami Women's University, "It should be appreciated that it writes history in a 'story' style using kana (also called 'woman's hand'), and that it was revolutionary in terms of being a history to be read by women, in making a historical tale by women and for women, combining history and literature to make history familiar." 
<br/>It laid the groundwork for the series of historical tales called 'mirror works.'<br/>
<h3>The Texts</h3>
</p>
<p>According to their form, the texts can be divided into three categories: the old texts, vulgate texts and variant texts. </p>
<p>The major surviving texts are as follows: the Umezawa manuscript （formerly the Sanjonishi manuscript, old text, first subgroup, a National Treasure）, the Yomei Archives manuscript （old text, second subgroup）, the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Nishi Hongan-ji Temple.html">Nishi Hongan-ji Temple</a> manuscript （vulgate text, first subgroup, an Important Cultural Property）, old movable type manuscripts （printed in the Genna (Japan) and Kan'ei eras (1615-44)）, woodblock-printed manuscripts of the Meireki era (1655-58) （vulgate text, second subgroup）, a nine-volume illustrated abridgement （vulgate text, third subgroup）, and the Tomioka manuscript （two texts-A and B, variant texts, with A, an Important Cultural Property, and both A and B up to chapter 30), etc. </p>
<p>Among them, the Umezawa manuscript (40 chapters, 17 books), which <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Sanetaka SANJONISHI.html">Sanetaka SANJONISHI</a> obtained and gave his descendants, was designated as a former National Treasure in 1935 and as a present National Treasure in 1955, as the oldest complete manuscript copied by hand before the mid-Kamakura period. It is a combination of a manuscript on rectangular paper (10 books, up to chapter 20, copied by hand, mid-Kamakura period） and a manuscript on square paper (seven books, up to chapter 40, copied by hand, early <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period) (the details of why they were combined are unclear); the title of the rectangular-paper manuscript was "Eiga <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Monogatari.html">Monogatari</a>," and the title of the square-paper manuscript was "Yotsugi <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Monogatari.html">Monogatari</a>." Additionally, the details of how <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Sanetaka SANJONISHI.html">Sanetaka SANJONISHI</a> got the text are in the "<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Sanetaka Koki.html">Sanetaka Koki</a>," in the entries for November 4 and 8 of 1509. The 'Iwanami bunko,' 'Nihon koten bungaku taikei' and 'Shimpen Nihon koten bungaku <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Zenshu.html">zenshu</a>' editions are based on this Umezawa manuscript. <h3>The Title and Contents of Each Volume</h3>
</p>
