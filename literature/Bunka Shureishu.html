<h1>Bunka Shureishu (文華秀麗集)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Bunka Shureishu is a Chokusen Kanshishu (a collection of Chinese verses compiled by Imperial command) compiled at the command of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Saga.html">Emperor Saga</a> in 818 during the early Heian period. The compilation consists of three volumes. As one of the three anthologies compiled by Imperial command, this compilation succeeded the earlier compiled <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Ryounshu.html">Ryounshu</a>. Bunka Shureishu was compiled by a number of people, including <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Fuyutsugu.html">FUJIWARA no Fuyutsugu</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/SUGAWARA no Kiyokimi.html">SUGAWARA no Kiyokimi</a>. Within the compilation, there are as many as 28 writers, including <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Saga.html">Emperor Saga</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Junna.html">Emperor Junna</a>, and it is said that works by the delegates from the country of Bo Hai, as well as a number of poetesses were also a part of this anthology. Originally, 148 poems were included in the Bunka Shureishu, but five of them did not remain in the collection. The compilation is stored in a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Gunsho Ruiju (Collection of Historical Documents).html">Gunsho Ruiju</a> (a collection of historical documents compiled by Hokiichi HANAWA). </p>
