<h1>Oku no <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Himemiko (Imperial Princess).html">Himemiko</a> (大来皇女)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Oku no <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Himemiko (Imperial Princess).html">Himemiko</a> (大来皇女, also written as 大伯皇女, February 15, 661 - February 2, 702) was an Imperial princess of Emperor Tenmu. Her mother was an Imperial princess of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Tenchi (Tenji).html">Emperor Tenchi</a>, Ota no <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Himemiko (Imperial Princess).html">Himemiko</a> (an older maternal half-sister of Emperor Jito). She was <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/building/Saigu (a vestal virgin princess serving at the Ise-jingu Shrine and her residence).html">Saigu</a> (Imperial Princess appointed to serve the deities of Ise-jingu Shrine). An older maternal half-sister of Imperial <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Prince Otsu.html">Prince Otsu</a>. </p>
<p>Biography<br/>
In 661, she was born in a boat which was on the way toward Tsukushi, sailing in the sea of Oku with <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Tenchi (Tenji).html">Emperor Tenchi</a> and his party on board. According to "<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan).html">Nihonshoki</a>" (Chronicles of Japan), Emperor Saimei and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Hashihito no Himemiko.html">Hashihito no Himemiko</a> were buried together in Ochi no Oka no Ue <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Imperial Mausoleum.html">Imperial Mausoleum</a> on March 30, 667, and there is a description stating that Ota no <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Himemiko (Imperial Princess).html">Himemiko</a> was buried in the tomb in front of this <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/building/Mausoleum.html">mausoleum</a>. Therefore, Ota no <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Himemiko (Imperial Princess).html">Himemiko</a>, the mother of Oku no <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Himemiko (Imperial Princess).html">Himemiko</a> and Imperial <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Prince Otsu.html">Prince Otsu</a>, seem to have passed away before March 30, 667. </p>
<p>After her father, Emperor Tenmu, established a system of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/building/Saigu (a vestal virgin princess serving at the Ise-jingu Shrine and her residence).html">Saigu</a>, Oku no <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Himemiko (Imperial Princess).html">Himemiko</a> went down to Ise-jingu Shrine as the first Saio (an unmarried Imperial princess serving at the Ise shrine) on November 15, 674. On March 17, 675, the following year, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Tochi no Himemiko (also pronounced Toichi no Himemiko).html">Tochi no Himemiko</a> and Princess Ahe (later <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Empress Genmei.html">Empress Genmei</a>) visited Ise-jingu Shrine. On May 27, 686, Taki no <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Himemiko (Imperial Princess).html">Himemiko</a>, Yamashiro Hime no <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Okimi (great king) (Yamato sovereignty).html">Okimi</a>, and Mrs. ISHIKAWA were sent to Ise-jingu Shrine. She retired on December 10 of the same year, and returned to the capital after Imperial <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Prince Otsu.html">Prince Otsu</a> was killed on a charge of treason on October 28. On February 2, 702, she passed away. </p>
<p>In "<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Manyoshu (Collection of Ten Thousand Leaves).html">Manyoshu</a>" (Collection of Ten Thousand Leaves), she left six poems in which she expressed her feelings toward her younger maternal half-brother Imperial <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Prince Otsu.html">Prince Otsu</a>, who was killed on a charge of treason. Natsumi-haiji Ruined Temple (national historical site) in Nabari City, Mie Prefecture is considered 'Shofuku-ji Temple, which was completed in 725 as part of a vow made by Oku no <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Himemiko (Imperial Princess).html">Himemiko</a>' ("Yakushiji Engi" [The History of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Yakushi-ji Temple.html">Yakushi-ji Temple</a>]). </p>
<p><h3>Poems composed by Oku no <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Himemiko (Imperial Princess).html">Himemiko</a></h3>
</p>
<p>Nos. 105 to 106 in the second volume of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Manyoshu (Collection of Ten Thousand Leaves).html">Manyoshu</a> (poems composed on the occasion of Imperial <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Prince Otsu.html">Prince Otsu</a>'s secret visit to Ise-jingu Shrine)<br/>
To see my brother off for <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Yamato.html">Yamato</a>, I stood outside in sorrow at midnight until I was drenched with early morning dew. 
<br/>It is difficult for even two people to go over the autumn mountain; how can you cross it alone?<br/>
</p>
<p>Nos. 163 to 164 in the second volume of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Manyoshu (Collection of Ten Thousand Leaves).html">Manyoshu</a> (poems composed on her way to the capital after Imperial <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Prince Otsu.html">Prince Otsu</a>'s death and her retirement)<br/>
It was much better to stay in Ise Province; why did I come here? My darling brother has been killed, leaving me behind. My brother whom I wanted to see is dead now; why did I come here? I have just gotten my horse tired. </p>
<p>Nos. 165 to 166 in the second volume of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Manyoshu (Collection of Ten Thousand Leaves).html">Manyoshu</a> (poems which were composed when the tomb of Imperial <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Prince Otsu.html">Prince Otsu</a> was moved to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Mt. Nijo (a mountain stretching in Nara Prefecture and Osaka Prefecture).html">Mt. Nijo</a> [also known as Mt. Futakami])<br/>
Now you are dead, and still I live; from tomorrow I will see Mt. Futakami as my brother. Even though I try to break off the flowering ashibi branch on the rock, nobody tells me that you are still here to be shown the branch by me. <h3>Relatives</h3>
