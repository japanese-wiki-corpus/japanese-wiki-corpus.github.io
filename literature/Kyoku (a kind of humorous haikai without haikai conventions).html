<h1>Kyoku (a kind of humorous <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Haikai (seventeen-syllable verse).html">haikai</a> without <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Haikai (seventeen-syllable verse).html">haikai</a> conventions) (狂句)</h1>
<p>Kyoku is one type of fixed form verse which developed in the latter half of the early-modern period in Japan. </p>
<p>Originally, kyoku were the same as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Senryu (satirical haiku).html">senryu</a> (humorous or ironical <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Haiku.html">haiku</a>), but after the death of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Senryu (satirical haiku).html">Senryu</a> the first (a poet), and during the time of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Senryu (satirical haiku).html">Senryu</a> the fourth, poems in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Senryu (satirical haiku).html">Senryu</a> style were named 'haifu kyoku'. Before the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Tenpo.html">Tenpo</a> era, they were commonly a witty verse consisting of five, seven, and seven lines, but after the Tenpo Reforms their contents were often depraved. Senryu MIZUTANI the fifth created 'ryufu shikiho' (the rules of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Senryu (satirical haiku).html">senryu</a>), which determined what was acceptable and unacceptable to express in a poem. However, this rule limited the variations of these poems, and the contents suffered, so poets began to compete to create the most superficial expression. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Senryu (satirical haiku).html">Senryu</a> the fifth changed the name 'haifu kyoku' into 'ryufu kyoku,' and the poetry of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Senryu (satirical haiku).html">senryu</a> survived the adversities of the Tempo Reforms, as literature, though, it had declined significantly. </p>
<p>It continued to be called '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Senryu (satirical haiku).html">senryu</a>,' 'senryufu kyoku,' or '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Senryu (satirical haiku).html">senryu</a> kyoku' until the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period, as it was kyoku composed by the members whose master was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Senryu (satirical haiku).html">Senryu</a>; this differentiated kyoku from other zappai (playful literature originating from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Haiku.html">haiku</a>). </p>
<p>Even after the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period, kyoku flourished under the nationwide organization called Ryufukai. However, by 1902 it was in a weaker position due to reform movements by the new <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Senryu (satirical haiku).html">senryu</a>, and, declining little by little, it continued until the time of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Senryu (satirical haiku).html">Senryu</a> the 13th in the Showa period, when it lost its influence completely. </p>
