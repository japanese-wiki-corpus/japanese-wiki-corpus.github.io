<h1>KI no Tokibumi (紀時文)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>KI no Tokibumi (c. 922 - c. 996) was a Japanese poet of the mid-Heian period. His father was KI no Tsurayuki, who was one of the Sanjurokkasen (36 Immortal Poets). There is a theory that regards the year of his birth as 928. </p>
<p>In 951, he was chosen as one of the Nashitsubo no Gonin (Five Gentlemen of the Pear Chamber), edited the "Manyoshu" (Collection of Ten Thousand Leaves) and selected waka for the "Gosen Wakashu" (Later selected collection of Japanese poetry). His highest office was as Jugoinojo (Junior Fifth Rank, Upper Grade), Kuraryo (Bureau of Palace Storehouses). </p>
<p>Although he was excellent at calligraphy, he seems to have been lacking in talent for waka poetry. </p>
<p>Only five of his poems were selected for the chokusen wakashu (anthologies of poems collected by Imperial command) starting when "Gosen Wakashu" (Later selected collection of Japanese poetry) was compiled and onwards, and no personal collection by him survives today. He was friends with such poets as Egyo, KIYOHARA no Motosuke, MINAMOTO no Shitago, and ONAKATOMI no Yoshinobu. </p>
