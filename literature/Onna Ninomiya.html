<h1>Onna Ninomiya (女二宮)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Onna Ninomiya is the second princess of the successive emperors. </p>
<p>This is the name given for convenience to the fictitious second princess of the Emperor in the tale, whose real name is unknown. The following are representative Onna Ninomiya. </p>
<p>The second princess of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Emperor Suzaku.html">Emperor Suzaku</a>, appearing in "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/The Tale of Genji.html">The Tale of Genji</a>."

<p>----<br/>
Onna Ninomiya is a fictitious character appearing in "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/The Tale of Genji.html">The Tale of Genji</a>." She was the second princess of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kinjo no Mikado.html">Kinjo no Mikado</a>, and her mother was Fujitsubo Princess (a daughter of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Sadaijin (Minister of the Left).html">Sadaijin</a> (Minister of the Left), and she is a different woman from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Fujitsubo.html">Fujitsubo</a>, the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Emperor Kiritsubo.html">Emperor Kiritsubo</a>'s second consort (the mother of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Emperor Reizei.html">Emperor Reizei</a>) and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Fujitsubo.html">Fujitsubo</a>, a consort of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Emperor Suzaku.html">Emperor Suzaku</a> (the mother of Onna Sannomiya)). She was loved deeply by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kinjo no Mikado.html">Kinjo no Mikado</a>, but before her Mogi (coming-of-age ceremony for girls), her mother passed away. Her mother's family was not as powerful as before, and she did not have any other supporter to depend on. 
<br/>That is why <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kinjo no Mikado.html">Kinjo no Mikado</a>, who worried about the future of his daughter, made her leave the Imperial family and married her to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kaoru.html">Kaoru</a>. ('<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Yadorigi.html">Yadorigi</a>' (The Ivy))<br/>
</p>
<p>However, her husband, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kaoru.html">Kaoru</a> loved only <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Ukifune (The Tale of Genji).html">Ukifune</a>, whom he kept at Uji, and Onna <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Ichinomiya.html">Ichinomiya</a>, who was a daughter of young lady <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Akashi (The Tale of Genji).html">Akashi</a> and also Onna Ninomiya's older sister by a different mother. Superficially, he cherished his lawful wife, Onna Ninomiya, out of consideration for the Emperor, but he did not seem to have a deep affection toward her. That reminds us of the relationships between <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Hikaru Genji.html">Hikaru Genji</a> and Onna Sannomiya, or between <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kashiwagi (The Tale of Genji).html">Kashiwagi</a> and Ochiba no Miya. </p>
<p>In the chapter of '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kagero (The Tale of Genji).html">Kagero</a>' (The Mayfly), <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kaoru.html">Kaoru</a> caught a glimpse of Onna <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Ichinomiya.html">Ichinomiya</a>, whom he loved, and after he went home, he made his wife, Onna Ninomiya, wear a thin robe which was the same as Onna <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Ichinomiya.html">Ichinomiya</a>'s, and made her keep a piece of ice just as Onna <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Ichinomiya.html">Ichinomiya</a> did, and moreover, he encouraged her to exchange letters with her older sister, Onna <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Ichinomiya.html">Ichinomiya</a>, because he wanted to see Onna <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Ichinomiya.html">Ichinomiya</a>'s letters. </p>
