<h1>Kookimi (小大君)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kookimi (date of birth and death unknown) was a female waka poet in the mid-Heian period. She is one of the Sanjurokkasen (36 Immortal Poets). Her father and mother are unknown due to the lack of her family tree. She served as Nyokurodo (a lower-ranking court lady) for the Emperor Sanjo who was Togu (the Crown Prince) at the time. She was then called Togu no sakon. </p>
<p>In addition to having a romantic relationship with FUJIWARA no Asateru, she also exchanged Zotoka poetry with TAIRA no Kanemori, FUJIWARA no Sanekata, FUJIWARA no Kinto, and others. Her waka poems were selected for chokusen wakashu (anthologies of Japanese poetry compiled by Imperial command) starting when 'Goshui Wakashu' (Later Collection of Gleanings of Japanese Poetry) was compiled and onwards. 
<br/>Her poetry was especially picked out as Kantoka (a prefatory poem or an opening poem) of 'Goshui Wakashu.'<br/>
She privately compiled 'Kookimi shu.'<br/>
