<h1>Kookimi (小大君)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kookimi (date of birth and death unknown) was a female waka poet in the mid-Heian period. She is one of the Sanjurokkasen (36 Immortal Poets). Her father and mother are unknown due to the lack of her family tree. She served as Nyokurodo (a lower-ranking court lady) for the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Sanjo.html">Emperor Sanjo</a> who was Togu (the Crown Prince) at the time. She was then called Togu no sakon. </p>
<p>In addition to having a romantic relationship with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Asateru.html">FUJIWARA no Asateru</a>, she also exchanged Zotoka poetry with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/TAIRA no Kanemori.html">TAIRA no Kanemori</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/FUJIWARA no Sanekata.html">FUJIWARA no Sanekata</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/FUJIWARA no Kinto.html">FUJIWARA no Kinto</a>, and others. Her waka poems were selected for chokusen wakashu (anthologies of Japanese poetry compiled by Imperial command) starting when '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Goshui Wakashu (Later Collection of Gleanings of Japanese Poetry).html">Goshui Wakashu</a>' (Later Collection of Gleanings of Japanese Poetry) was compiled and onwards.
