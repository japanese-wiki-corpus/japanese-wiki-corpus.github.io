<h1>Shofu (a style of Haikai) (蕉風)</h1>
<p>Shofu is a style of Haikai (17-syllable verse), the originator of which is Basho MATSUO. The kanji (Chinese characters) for Shofu are "蕉風" or "正風", and it can also be called Shomon. </p>
<p>Basho MATSUO started as a haikai poet of the Danrin school, but gradually he produced his own style of haikai on ordinary things with a basis in traditional Japanese poetry. The principle of the Shofu style of haikai is represented by terms such as Wabi, Sabi (these two imply the beauty of simplicity), Shiori (a capacity for empathy), Hosomi (understatement), or Karomi (a light tone). </p>
