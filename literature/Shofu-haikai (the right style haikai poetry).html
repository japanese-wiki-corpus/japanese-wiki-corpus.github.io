<h1>Shofu-haikai (the right style <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Haikai (seventeen-syllable verse).html">haikai</a> poetry) (正風俳諧)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>"Shofu-haikai" is the word for the concept of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Haikai (seventeen-syllable verse).html">haikai</a> (seventeen-syllable verse) which <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Basho MATSUO.html">Basho MATSUO</a> completed. </p>
<p>It was originally the name that Moritake ARAKIDA coined at the same time when he set <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Haikai (seventeen-syllable verse).html">haikai</a> rules in the autumn of 1540. Nevertheless, it was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Basho MATSUO.html">Basho MATSUO</a> who brought <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Haikai (seventeen-syllable verse).html">haikai</a>, popular literature based on the nature and human life, to the high art in its form and substance. Basho was the core of Shomon (Basho School) <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Haikai (seventeen-syllable verse).html">Haikai</a>, and he traveled to various parts of the country to spread '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Shofu (a style of Haikai).html">Shofu</a>' (right style) with deep thought over the nature and human life. Therefore the word Shofu-haikai came to be used as a word that means <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Haikai (seventeen-syllable verse).html">Haikai</a> of Basho, and the Chinese character for 'sho' of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Shofu (a style of Haikai).html">Shofu</a> was sometimes written as 'sho' of Basho. 
<br/>The following is the golden and everlasting saying of Basho<br/>
</p>
<p>Shofu-haikai is the spirit of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Manyoshu (Collection of Ten Thousand Leaves).html">Manyoshu</a> (the oldest anthology of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Tanka.html">tanka</a>, thirty-one-syllable poem).'<br/>
Therefore it is the way that everybody should appreciate.'<br/>
</p>
<p>In the Tenmei era in the latter half of the eighteenth century, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Buson YOSA.html">Buson YOSA</a> tried to make a great 'innovation' by keeping the essence of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Shofu (a style of Haikai).html">Shofu</a> but allowing freer use of words and raised a modern sense, in other words, excitement towards nature and daily life grounded in reality. </p>
<p>However, in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period in the beginning of twentieth century, led by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Shiki MASAOKA.html">Shiki MASAOKA</a>, Seisei MATSUSE, Hekigoto KAWAHIGASHI, Meisetsu NAITO, and Kyoshi TAKAHAMA organized an association, New Hototogisu (name of magazine) based on "Japan" (a newspaper) and targeted to overthrow <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Shofu (a style of Haikai).html">Shofu</a>. Consequently <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Haiku.html">haiku</a> in the later ages cannot necessarily be said to have succeeded <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Shofu (a style of Haikai).html">Shofu</a>. </p>
