<h1>Kingyoku Wakashu (Gold gems poetry collection) (金玉和歌集)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kingyoku Wakashu is a personal collection of poetry written in the mid Heian period. 
<br/>Its author is considered to be 'a student of Japanese poetry KAKINOMOTO no Suenari.'<br/>
However, there was no title as 'a student of Japanese poetry' in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Daigaku-ryo.html">Daigaku-ryo</a> (Bureau of Education under the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ritsuryo.html">ritsuryo</a> system), and it was actually <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/FUJIWARA no Kinto.html">FUJIWARA no Kinto</a> who used a changed name. It is supposed to have been compiled from 1007 to 1011. </p>
<p>According to the preface of "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Goshui Wakashu (Later Collection of Gleanings of Japanese Poetry).html">Goshui Wakashu</a>" (4th imperial anthology), <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kinto (tea cloth container).html">Kinto</a> described the origin of the title as 'I chose the best of best poets in the past and now, and named it as a collection of gold gems.'<br/>
Among many waka from "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Manyoshu (Collection of Ten Thousand Leaves).html">Manyoshu</a>" (Collection of Ten Thousand Leaves) to the present (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kanko.html">Kanko</a> era), total 78 poets are recorded in three parts: 39 poets in four seasons (spring: 22, summer: 2, autumn: 7, and winter: 8), 7 poets in love, and 32 poets in misc (there are books that contain 69 poets or 76 poets). Among <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kajin (Waka or Tanka Poets).html">kajin</a> (waka poet), <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/KI no Tsurayuki.html">KI no Tsurayuki</a> has the most poets (eight), followed by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/OSHIKOCHI no Mitsune.html">OSHIKOCHI no Mitsune</a> and Ise (Poetess). </p>
