<p>Hikaru Genji is a main character in "Genji <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Monogatari.html">Monogatari</a>" (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/The Tale of Genji.html">The Tale of Genji</a>), written by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Murasaki Shikibu.html">Murasaki Shikibu</a>. 
<br/>He appears from the first chapter, '<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Kiritsubo.html">Kiritsubo</a>' (The Paulownia Court) to the fortieth chapter, '<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Maboroshi (The Wizard) (The Tale of Genji).html">Maboroshi</a>' (The Wizard), among the 54 chapters of "Genji <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Monogatari.html">Monogatari</a>,"<br/>
Hikaru Genji' is a nickname that means 'A beautiful and shining Genji,' hence his actual name is not 'Hikaru' (shining). </p>
<p>Model<br/>
He is a fictitious character, but there are various theories proposing that he was modeled after an actual person. The most likely theory is that Hikaru Genji was modeled after <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shoichii.html">Shoichii</a> (Senior First Rank) <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Kawara (tile).html">Kawara</a> no <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Sadaijin (Minister of the Left).html">Sadaijin</a> (Minister of the Left) <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Toru.html">MINAMOTO no Toru</a> of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Saga-Genji.html">Saga-Genji</a> (Minamoto clan). Other people who were considered possible models for Hikaru Genji were <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Sadaijin (Minister of the Left).html">Sadaijin</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Takaakira.html">MINAMOTO no Takaakira</a> of Daigo-Genji (Minamoto clan), <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Koko.html">Emperor Koko</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/FUJIWARA no Michinaga.html">FUJIWARA no Michinaga</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/FUJIWARA no Korechika.html">FUJIWARA no Korechika</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/MINAMOTO no Hikaru.html">MINAMOTO no Hikaru</a> (a court noble), <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Saga.html">Emperor Saga</a> and so on. Even if the character was modeled after a real person, other stories concerning court nobles during the Heian period seem to have been added. </p>
<p>Brief Personal History<br/>
He was the second prince of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Emperor Kiritsubo.html">Emperor Kiritsubo</a>. His mother was <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Kiritsubo no Koi.html">Kiritsubo no Koi</a> (a court lady of lower status). Being blessed with shining beauty and talent as a child, he was given the nickname 'Hikaru Kimi' (literally, shining prince). His mother passed away when he was three. His deep feelings towards <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Fujitsubo.html">Fujitsubo</a>, who resembles his mother, becomes his first love, and he holds sexual relationships with various women throughout his life as he searches for a woman with his mother's features. His father, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Emperor Kiritsubo.html">Emperor Kiritsubo</a>, had intended to make Hikaru Kimi the Crown Prince but instead demotes him to the status of a subject and gives him the family name of Genji because he fears the fact that his son would not be supported by his mother's family, and because a Korean predicted that the country will be in a state of disorder if Hikaru Kimi became emperor. </p>
<p>His feelings for <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Fujitsubo.html">Fujitsubo</a>, who enters the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kokyu (empresss residence).html">kokyu</a> (Empress's residence) of his father because she looks like his lost mother, became stronger and he has a sexual relationship with her (resulting in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Emperor Reizei.html">Emperor Reizei</a>), but no one knows of their illicit affair. Hikaru Genji acts as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Regent.html">regent</a> to his child from his Crown Prince years, and when the child becomes <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Emperor Reizei.html">Emperor Reizei</a> and plans to abdicate the throne to Genji after learning the facts, Genji strongly refuses. Later though, he is given the title of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Jun Daijo tenno.html">Jun Daijo tenno</a> (quasi ex-emperor), which exceeds the rank highest rank that a subject can attain. Subsequently, he comes to be called <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Rokujoin.html">Rokujoin</a>, after the name of his residence. </p>
<p>His legal wife was Aoi no ue, a daughter of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Sadaijin (Minister of the Left).html">Sadaijin</a> (the Minister of the Left), whom he marries upon coming of age; and later, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Onna San no Miya.html">Onna San no Miya</a>, a daughter of his older brother, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Emperor Suzaku.html">Emperor Suzaku</a>, becomes his legal wife. However, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Murasaki no ue.html">Murasaki no ue</a> (also called <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Wakamurasaki.html">Wakamurasaki</a> or Murasaki no Kimi), whom Genji brought up to become his ideal woman, is his legal wife in all but name, and he loves her the most among his many women. Other concubines or lovers of Genji are <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Rokujo no Miyasudokoro.html">Rokujo no Miyasudokoro</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Utsusemi (The Tale of Genji).html">Utsusemi</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Yugao (The Tale of Genji).html">Yugao</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Suetsumuhana (The Tale of Genji).html">Suetsumuhana</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Oborozukiyo (The Tale of Genji).html">Oborozukiyo</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Hanachirusato.html">Hanachirusato</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Akashi (The Tale of Genji).html">Akashi</a> no Onkata, and so on. He also showed interest in his cousin, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Asagao (The Tale of Genji).html">Asagao</a>, and Empress Akikonomu, who was the former <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Saigu (a vestal virgin princess serving at the Ise-jingu Shrine and her residence).html">Saigu</a> (Imperial Princess appointed to serve the deities of Ise-jingu Shrine) and the daughter of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Rokujo no Miyasudokoro.html">Rokujo no Miyasudokoro</a>. </p>
<p>According to sukuyo (astrology), it was predicted that 'there would be three children: one will be an Emperor, one will be an Empress, and even the inferior one in the middle will be Dajo Daijin (Grand Minister of State)' (in the chapter of '<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Miotsukushi (The Tale of Genji).html">Miotsukushi</a>' (Channel Buoys)), and the prediction comes true since his three children were: <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Emperor Reizei.html">Emperor Reizei</a>, the son with <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Fujitsubo.html">Fujitsubo</a>; <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Yugiri (The Tale of Genji).html">Yugiri</a>, the eldest son with Aoi no ue; and Princess <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Akashi (The Tale of Genji).html">Akashi</a>, the daughter with <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Akashi (The Tale of Genji).html">Akashi</a> no Onkata. However, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Emperor Reizei.html">Emperor Reizei</a>'s birth was a secret, and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Onna San no Miya.html">Onna San no Miya</a>'s child was officially recognized as his second son, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Kaoru.html">Kaoru</a> (because of the prediction, Genji doesn't believe <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Onna San no Miya.html">Onna San no Miya</a> is pregnant at first, but it makes sense later when he learns of her affair with <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Kashiwagi (The Tale of Genji).html">Kashiwagi</a>). He adopts Empress Akikonomu, a daughter of the late <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Rokujo no Miyasudokoro.html">Rokujo no Miyasudokoro</a>, and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Tamakazura (The Tale of Genji).html">Tamakazura</a>, a daughter between <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Tono Chujo (a government post).html">Tono Chujo</a> (the first secretary's captain) and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Yugao (The Tale of Genji).html">Yugao</a> as his daughters. </p>
<p>After his older brother <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Emperor Suzaku.html">Emperor Suzaku</a> ascends the throne, he goes into voluntary seclusion at Suma, and then at <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Akashi (The Tale of Genji).html">Akashi</a>, under pressure from the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Udaijin (Minister of the Right).html">Udaijin</a> (Minister of the Right) and Kokiden no <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Nyogo (rank of court lady).html">nyogo</a> (Empress Kokiden) group, who were maternal relatives of the emperor and due to the scandal about his relationship with <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Oborozukiyo (The Tale of Genji).html">Oborozukiyo</a>, who had become <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Naishi.html">Naishi</a> no Kami (Principal Handmaid). This is the time when he has a relationship with <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Akashi (The Tale of Genji).html">Akashi</a> no Onkata, and as a result, the daughter who becomes Empress <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Akashi (The Tale of Genji).html">Akashi</a> is born. After he returns to the capital, he makes a comeback as a guardian of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Emperor Reizei.html">Emperor Reizei</a>, adopting Empress Akikonomu as his daughter and making her <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Emperor Reizei.html">Emperor Reizei</a>'s wife. Subsequently, Genji becomes Dajo Daijin and builds the grand residence of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Rokujoin.html">Rokujoin</a> consisting of four sections, which symbolizes his prosperity. The southwest quarter, or the Autumn Quarter (former residence of Rokujo Miyasudokoro) was assigned to Empress Akikonomu as her home, and he lived in the southeast quarter, or the Spring Quarter, together with <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Murasaki no ue.html">Murasaki no ue</a> and Princess <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Akashi (The Tale of Genji).html">Akashi</a>. The northeast quarter, or the Summer Quarter, was assigned to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Hanachirusato.html">Hanachirusato</a> (later, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Tamakazura (The Tale of Genji).html">Tamakazura</a> was taken in here), and the northwest quarter, or the Winter Quarter, was assigned to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Akashi (The Tale of Genji).html">Akashi</a> no kimi, and he also took care of his former lovers at Nijo no Toin.. </p>
<p>When he reaches 40 years of age, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Emperor Reizei.html">Emperor Reizei</a> treats him as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Jun Daijo tenno.html">Jun Daijo tenno</a>. When his older brother <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Suzakuin.html">Suzakuin</a> became a priest, he asked Genji, who was at the height of his glory, if he could be the guardian of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Suzakuin.html">Suzakuin</a>'s daughter and Genji's niece, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Onna San no Miya.html">Onna San no Miya</a>, and take her as his legal wifebecause he did not have a noble wife with powerful guardians who was suitable as hihs legal wife. Even after the passing of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Fujitsubo.html">Fujitsubo</a>, it was hard for Genji to stop loving her, and he was swayed by the fact that <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Onna San no Miya.html">Onna San no Miya</a> was a niece of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Fujitsubo.html">Fujitsubo</a> as was <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Murasaki no ue.html">Murasaki no ue</a>, so he could not refuse the offer. However, after he marries <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Onna San no Miya.html">Onna San no Miya</a>, he was disappointed to find that she was just a childish girl, and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Murasaki no ue.html">Murasaki no ue</a> was also shocked by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Onna San no Miya.html">Onna San no Miya</a>'s marriage out of the royal family that she eventually becomes ill due to stress. A shadow is beginning to fall over the glory of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Rokujoin.html">Rokujoin</a>. </p>
<p>After a while, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Onna San no Miya.html">Onna San no Miya</a>'s affair becomes apparent, just like Genji, who once betrayed his father <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Emperor Kiritsubo.html">Emperor Kiritsubo</a>. Although Genji's anger builds up against <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Onna San no Miya.html">Onna San no Miya</a> and her lover <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Kashiwagi (The Tale of Genji).html">Kashiwagi</a>, he sees a newborn baby (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Kaoru.html">Kaoru</a>) and realizes that it is the fruit of the sin that he committed in his youth (karmic retribution). Subsequently, his anger cools after <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Onna San no Miya.html">Onna San no Miya</a> becomes a nun and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Kashiwagi (The Tale of Genji).html">Kashiwagi</a> passes away, and he considers that his deceased father might also have known of Genji's sin but did not blame him, so he makes up his mind to raise the child as his own without telling anybody the secret. </p>
<p>After the death of his beloved <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Murasaki no ue.html">Murasaki no ue</a>, he retires to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Sagano.html">Sagano</a>, leads a priest's life for a few years and then passes away, as told later in the chapter of '<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Yadorigi.html">Yadorigi</a>' (The Ivy). The work contains no description regarding the time from his becoming a priest to his death, and the chapter of '<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Kumogakure.html">Kumogakure</a>' (Vanished into the Clouds), which is suggestive of the death of Genji, but some say that the text was lost. </p>
<p>The characteristics of a person who has worldly prosperity but always thinking of the Buddhist path despite his innumerable love affairs, are divided and inherited by the characters of the next generation, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Kaoru.html">Kaoru</a> and Nioumiya. It also influenced Sagoromo no Taisho, the main character of "<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Sagoromo Monogatari.html">Sagoromo Monogatari</a> (The Tale of Sagoromo)," which was written shortly after "Genji <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Monogatari.html">Monogatari</a>." </p>
