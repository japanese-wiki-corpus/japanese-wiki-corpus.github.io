<h1>Shizu no iwaya (志都乃石室)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Shizu no iwaya has its origin in a folklore in the myth of the development of the land by Okuninushi no Mikoto and Sukunahikona no Mikoto, and the place was depicted in a Oishi no Suguri no Mahito's poem in Manyoshu (Volume 3-355) "Onamuchi and Sukunahiko lived in Shizu no iwaya; how many generations that have been passed by?"<br/>
According to "Shoku Nihongi" (Chronicle of Japan Continued), the author Oishi no Suguri no Mahito was appointed to Mino Shosakan (officer of Mino Province) in 738 and Ge-jugoinoge (Jugoinoge (Junior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade) given to persons outside Kyoto) in 750. 
<br/>The location of Shizu no iwaya is unknown, and there are several theories as follows:<br/>
</p>
<p>The Stone Treasure Hall of Oshiko Jinja Shrine (Takasago City, Hyogo Prefecture)<br/>
Shizu no iwaya (Oda City, Shimane Prefecture)<br/>
Atsutane HIRATA's "Koshiden" (Commentary on Ancient History) identifies this as the place of Shizu no iwaya. </p>
<p>Iwaya in Shizunoiwaya Jinja Shrine (Onan-cho, Shimane Prefecture)<br/>
Norinaga MOTOORI's "Tamakatsuma" (a collection of essays) identifies this as the place of Shizu no iwaya. </p>
