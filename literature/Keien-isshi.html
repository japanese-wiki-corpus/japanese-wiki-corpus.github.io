<h1>Keien-isshi (桂園一枝)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Keien-isshi is a collection of waka (Japanese poetry) by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kageki KAGAWA.html">Kageki KAGAWA</a> (1768-1843) compiled by himself in the late <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Edo Period.html">Edo Period</a>. </p>
<p>It was completed in 1828 and published in 1830. Three-volume. This is the most famous poetry collection of Kageki who evolved <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Roan OZAWA.html">Roan OZAWA</a>'s proposal of "Tadagoto uta" (a style of poetry of unaffected feelings with straightforward wording) and dominated the poetry circle based in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> with a sophisticated and fresh style of poetry. Kageki's style of poetry was very popular until the early Meiji Period and called <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Keien.html">Keien</a> school because of this anthology. Kageki found his ideal style of poetry in '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kokin Wakashu (A Collection of Ancient and Modern Japanese Poetry).html">Kokin Wakashu</a>' (A Collection of Ancient and Modern Japanese Poetry) and admired <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/KI no Tsurayuki.html">KI no Tsurayuki</a> as Kasei (great poet), so he compiled this anthology by himself to put his ideal into practice. The anthology consisted of four sections: Four seasons, Love, Miscellaneous, and Other categories (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Choka (long epic song).html">Choka</a> (long poem), <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Sedoka (A poem where the head is repeated).html">Sedoka</a> (head-repeated poem), and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Haikai (seventeen-syllable verse).html">Haikai</a> (Seventeen-syllable verse)). </p>
