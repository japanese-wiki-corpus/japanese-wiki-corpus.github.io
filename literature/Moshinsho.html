<h1>Moshinsho (孟津抄)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Moshinsho is a commentary on "The Tale of Genji," written by Tanemichi KUJO, the Kanpaku (regent) during the Sengoku (Period of Warring States) and Azuchi-Momoyama periods. Although the original consisted of 20 volumes, there are surviving texts with 15 volumes, 21 volumes and 54 volumes. 
<br/>It later came to be called "Kuzensho," after another name of his, 'Kujo Zengo.'<br/>
</p>
<p>He was taught by his uncle, Kineda SANJONISHI. He added to the Genji scholarship of the Sanjonishi family not only theories on earlier commentaries such as the "Kakai-sho," the "Kacho yojo" (Atmosphere of Flowers and Birds) and the "Rokasho" (playing with blossoms), but also theories of his own, and annotated each volume. Although some draft-manuscripts and fair copies exist, it is believed that few original manuscripts and prints have survived. </p>
