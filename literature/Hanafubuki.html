<h1>Hanafubuki (花吹雪)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Hanafubuki is the state in which flower petals are falling like a snowstorm. </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>In Japan, the word 'hana (flower)' traditionally refers to cherry blossom especially in haiku (seventeen-syllable poem) and waka (thirty-one-syllable poem), so 'hanafubuki' specifically refers to cherry blossoms in full bloom falling like a snowstorm. </p>
<p>In the field of haiku, cherry blossoms falling like a snowstorm is regarded as a scenery distinctive of spring (in particular the season between late spring to early summer), so "hanafubuki" is designated as a kigo (a word depicting a season) for spring. <h3>Usage in photograph sticker makers</h3>
</p>
<p>Namco Bandai Games Inc. produced sticker makers large enough for one to step into named 'Hanafubuki' and 'Hanafubuki 2.'<br/>
In 2007, the latest version 'Hanafubuki New' was released. </p>
