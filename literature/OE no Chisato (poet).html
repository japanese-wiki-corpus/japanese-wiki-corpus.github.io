<h1>OE no Chisato (poet) (大江千里 (歌人))</h1>
<p></p>
<p>OE no Chisato (year of birth and death unknown, male) was a poet and scholar of the early Heian period. He is said to be the son of Sangi (councilor) OE no Otondo, but there is another theory that regards him as the son of OE no Gyokuen and the grandson of Otondo. His brother was OE no Chifuru. 維明 and 維繁 were his sons. He was ranked as Shogoi (Senior Fifth Rank), Hyobusho (War Ministry). He is regarded as one of the medieval 36 Immortal Poets. </p>
<p><h3>Career</h3>
</p>
<p>Although he was a Confucian scholar who studied at the Daigaku-ryo (Bureau of Education under the ritsuryo system), scarcely any Chinese prose and poetry by him remains. He filled various posts such as Nakatsukasa shojo (Junior Secretary of Ministry of Central Affairs), Hyobu shojo, (Junior Secretary of the Ministry of War) and Hyobu taijo (Senior Secretary of the Ministry of War), but the details are unknown. He took part in an uta-awase (poetry contest) in the reign of the Emperor Uda, and in 894, he composed and presented a personal collection "Kudai Waka" (Waka on Themes of Lines) (Oe no Chisato Shu) due to an imperial order from the Emperor Uda. In addition, he and SUGAWARA no Koreyoshi composed 'Jogan Kyakushiki Code' (Regulations and Procedures of the Jogan Era) together. His waka poetry is in a Confucianist style and is characterized by trying to express the lines of "Bai-Shi Wen Ji" (a collection of poems by Hakkyoi, a famous Chinese poet) using the waka style. <h3>Career as an official</h3>
