<h1>Aki no Yonaga <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Monogatari.html">Monogatari</a> (Tales of Long Autumn Nights) (秋夜長物語)</h1>
<p>"Aki no Yonaga <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Monogatari.html">Monogatari</a>" is a representative <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Chigo.html">chigo</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Monogatari.html">monogatari</a> (tales of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Chigo.html">chigo</a>, or page), about male homosexuality between priests and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Chigo.html">chigo</a>. It consists of one volume. The author and the year of creation are unknown. There is a printed book of the tale published in 1642. </p>
<p>During the reign of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Gohorikawa.html">Emperor Gohorikawa</a>, when the venerable Sensai was still Keikai Risshi (Buddhist priest) in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Mt. Hiei.html">Mt. Hiei</a>, he and Umewaka, who was a son of Hanazono <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Sadaijin (Minister of the Left).html">Sadaijin</a> (Minister of the Left) and also a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Chigo.html">chigo</a> in Miidera and Shogoin Temples, slept together. </p>
<p>The venerable Sensai is a character borrowed from reality, but the tale was embellished on the basis of the fact which was written and collected in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Saigyo.html">Saigyo</a>'s "Senjusho" (compiled Buddhist tales of 13th century). </p>
