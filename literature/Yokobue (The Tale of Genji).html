This is the 37th chapter. It describes how the yokobue (flute) which was treasured by the late <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kashiwagi (The Tale of Genji).html">Kashiwagi</a> passed into <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Hikaru Genji.html">Hikaru Genji</a>'s hands. </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>It is a story about <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Hikaru Genji.html">Hikaru Genji</a>, age 49. </p>
<p>The first anniversary of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kashiwagi (The Tale of Genji).html">Kashiwagi</a>'s death came. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kashiwagi (The Tale of Genji).html">Kashiwagi</a>'s father, To no Chujo (the first secretary's captain), who did not know behind-the-scene circumstances, thanked Genji for his condolatory call and felt sadness again. </p>
<p>A bamboo shoot was sent to Onna Sannomiya (the Third Princess) by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Emperor Suzaku.html">Emperor Suzaku</a>, who lamented a series of misfortunes happening to his daughters such as Onna Sannomiya's becoming a nun, the death of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Ochiba no miya.html">Ochiba no miya</a>'s husband. Genji held <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kaoru.html">Kaoru</a>, who bit the bamboo shoot with his new baby teeth, looked back on his life so far, and paid attention to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kaoru.html">Kaoru</a>'s young, but noble countenance. </p>
<p>One autumn evening, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Yugiri (The Tale of Genji).html">Yugiri</a> (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/The Tale of Genji.html">The Tale of Genji</a>) visited <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kashiwagi (The Tale of Genji).html">Kashiwagi</a>'s widow, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Ochiba no miya.html">Ochiba no miya</a>. On his way home, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Ochiba no miya.html">Ochiba no miya</a>'s mother, Ichijo no Miyasudokoro, sent <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Yugiri (The Tale of Genji).html">Yugiri</a> the yokobue that <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kashiwagi (The Tale of Genji).html">Kashiwagi</a> left. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kashiwagi (The Tale of Genji).html">Kashiwagi</a> appeared in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Yugiri (The Tale of Genji).html">Yugiri</a>'s dream that night, telling that there was somebody else whom he wanted to hand the yokobue to. </p>
<p>Subsequently, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Yugiri (The Tale of Genji).html">Yugiri</a>, who visited Genji, saw <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kashiwagi (The Tale of Genji).html">Kashiwagi</a>'s face in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kaoru.html">Kaoru</a>, who was playing innocently with the children of young lady <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Akashi (The Tale of Genji).html">Akashi</a>. Then he told Genji about <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kashiwagi (The Tale of Genji).html">Kashiwagi</a>'s last words and the dream, but Genji just said that he would take charge of the yokobue, and changed the subject. </p>
