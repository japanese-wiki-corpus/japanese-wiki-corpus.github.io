<h1>Zen-zen Taiheiki (前々太平記)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>"Zen-zen Taiheiki"is a war chronicle featuring the history from the Nara Period to the early Heian Period. </p>
<p><h3>Outline</h3>
</p>
<p>The book was written in the Shotoku (Japan) era by Senan HIRAZUMI (year of birth unknown, died on September 4, 1734) who served as a family doctor to the lord of the domain of Iyo-Yoshida. Zen-zen Taiheiki describes the prehistory of "Zen Taiheki" (written in 1681) featuring battles and conflicts of the mid and late Heian Period. Zen-zen Taiheiki is a collection of 146 sections, each section describing one event which occurred during the period from the enthronement of Emperor Shomu (724) to the reign of Emperor Daigo (enthroned in 897). The book is characterized by how it vigorously cites "Ise Monogatari" (The Tales of Ise) and "Genji Monogatari" (The Tale of Genji), that it includes many descriptions about Buddhism and that it stands as an enlightening book with a balanced outlook not placing too much emphasis on any of the three religions, Buddhism, Shintoism or Confucianism. The book greatly influenced many writers of the mid and late Edo Period such as Ayatari TAKEBE, who wrote "Honcho Suikoden" (Japanese Water Margin) based on the book. Although the book was a vulgar book on history, which caught onto the popularity of "Taiheiki," the world described in Zen-zen Taiheiki provided many subjects for arts and cultures such as Koshaku (story telling), Joruri (Ballad drama), Kabuki (traditional drama performed by male actors) and novels and also gave people of the Edo Period basic knowledge about history on which people at that time could depend when they enjoyed Kabuki or read books. </p>
<p>The book, consisting of 146 sections in 21volumes. was published in 1715. 
<br/>The book was written under the pen name of 'Kenshunsanjin, Kitton.'<br/>
