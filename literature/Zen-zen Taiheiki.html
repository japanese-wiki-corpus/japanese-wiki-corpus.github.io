<p><h3>Outline</h3>
</p>
<p>The book was written in the Shotoku (Japan) era by Senan HIRAZUMI (year of birth unknown, died on September 4, 1734) who served as a family doctor to the lord of the domain of Iyo-Yoshida. Zen-zen <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Taiheiki (Record of the Great Peace).html">Taiheiki</a> describes the prehistory of "Zen Taiheki" (written in 1681) featuring battles and conflicts of the mid and late Heian Period. Zen-zen <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Taiheiki (Record of the Great Peace).html">Taiheiki</a> is a collection of 146 sections, each section describing one event which occurred during the period from the enthronement of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Shomu.html">Emperor Shomu</a> (724) to the reign of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Daigo.html">Emperor Daigo</a> (enthroned in 897). The book is characterized by how it vigorously cites "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Ise Monogatari.html">Ise Monogatari</a>" (The Tales of Ise) and "Genji <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Monogatari.html">Monogatari</a>" (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/The Tale of Genji.html">The Tale of Genji</a>), that it includes many descriptions about Buddhism and that it stands as an enlightening book with a balanced outlook not placing too much emphasis on any of the three religions, Buddhism, Shintoism or Confucianism. The book greatly influenced many writers of the mid and late <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Edo Period.html">Edo Period</a> such as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Ayatari TAKEBE.html">Ayatari TAKEBE</a>, who wrote "Honcho Suikoden" (Japanese Water Margin) based on the book. Although the book was a vulgar book on history, which caught onto the popularity of "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Taiheiki (Record of the Great Peace).html">Taiheiki</a>," the world described in Zen-zen <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Taiheiki (Record of the Great Peace).html">Taiheiki</a> provided many subjects for arts and cultures such as Koshaku (story telling), <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Joruri.html">Joruri</a> (Ballad drama), <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kabuki.html">Kabuki</a> (traditional drama performed by male actors) and novels and also gave people of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Edo Period.html">Edo Period</a> basic knowledge about history on which people at that time could depend when they enjoyed <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kabuki.html">Kabuki</a> or read books. </p>
<p>The book, consisting of 146 sections in 21volumes. was published in 1715. 
<br/>The book was written under the pen name of 'Kenshunsanjin, Kitton.'<br/>
