</p>
<p>Emperor Reizei: The tenth prince of Emperor Kiritsubo. In truth, however, he was the son of Hikaru Genji born by Empress Fujitsubo. </p>
<p>Yugiri: The first son of Hikaru Genji. His mother was Lady Aoi. 
<br/>(Actually, the eldest son was Emperor Reizei, Yugiri was the second son.)<br/>
</p>
<p>Young Lady Akashi (also called Empress Akashi and Lady Akashi): The eldest daughter of Hikaru Genji. Her mother was Lady Akashi. She became the adopted daughter of Lady Murasaki. She was the mother of Niou no Miya. </p>
<p>Kaoru (also called Kaoru no Kimi): Officially he is the second son of Hikaru Genji, but in fact he was the son of Kashiwagi born by Onna San no Miya. <h3>The House of the Sadaijin (Minister of the Left)</h3>
</p>
<p>This is the family Genji entered into by marrying one of their daughters. The Fujiwara clan. There is a vehement power struggle within the Udaijin's family, who are of the same Fujiwara clan. Being Genji's guardian, his political stance during the reign of Emperor Kiritsubo was close to Genji's. Their relationship continued even after the death of Lady Aoi, when Genji requested that he look after Yugiri. Despite To no Chujo being the head of the family, he was always in competition with Genji for power and always failed to take it from him. Furthermore, when the story reaches the "ten chapters of Uji jujo" (the Ten Books of Uji), Kobai is the head of the family and Yugiri has become the Sadaijin. </p>
<p>While the lineage between Genji and Emperor Reizei as a father and son is implied to be skill in pictures and painting, the Fujiwara clan regards music as their specialty. However, Yugiri has a deeper knowledge and skill in music, which might be because he has a stronger relationship with the House of the Sadaijin. </p>
<p>To no Chujo: The son of the Sadaijin and Omiya. He is lady Aoi's older maternal half-brother. Later he served as the Minister of the Palace and the Grand Minister. </p>
<p>The Sadaijin (also called Hidari no Otodo): The father of Lady Aoi and To no Chujo. He is Genji's father-in-law. The head of the House of the Sadaijin of the Fujiwara clan. He has close relations with Emperor Kiritsubo and Genji both in public and private. He was also Genji's guardian when Genji was young. When Emperor Reizei ascended to the throne, he was appointed as the Grand Minister (at the age of 63, in 'Miotsukushi' (Channel Buoys)) at the request of Genji. He died at the age of 66. ('Usugumo' (Wisps of Cloud)). </p>
<p>Omiya: Emperor Kiritsubo's sister and the lawful wife of the Sadaijin. She was the mother of Lady Aoi and To no Chujo. </p>
<p>The fourth daughter of the Udaijin: The younger sister of Grand Empress Kokiden, and older sister of Oborozukiyo. She was To no Chujo's lawful wife. She was estranged from her husband in her youth. She is the mother of Kashiwagi, Kobai and Empress Kokiden. </p>
<p>Kashiwagi: The eldest son of To no Chujo (Minister of the Palace). He and his cousin Yugiri are good friends. He fell in love with Onna San no Miya, Genji's second lawful wife. </p>
<p>Kobai: The second son of To no Chujo (Minister of the Palace), and Kashiwagi's younger brother. His mother is the fourth daughter of the Udaijin. </p>
<p>Kokiden no nyogo (Empress Kokiden): The daughter of To no Chujo (Minister of the Palace). Emperor Suzaku's mother (Grand Empress Kokiden) is her aunt. She was Emperor Reizei's first consort. She was close to the emperor in age and had been in his favor. However, she could not match Empress Akikonomu, who was under the guardianship of Genji, and was not able to win the status of empress. </p>
<p>Kumoi no Kari: The daughter of To no Chujo (Minister of the Palace). She was Yugiri's lawful wife. Her mother came from the royal family, but became estranged from her husband and later married Azechi no Dainagon. </p>
<p>Tamakazura: The daughter of To no Chujo (Minister of the Palace) and Yugao. Genji adopted her as his daughter. </p>
<p>Omi no Kimi (the Omi Daughter): An illegitimate daughter of To no Chujo (Minister of the Palace). Before he knew that Tamakazura was his own daughter, he envied having such a daughter, and wondered if he too might have a daughter somewhere, so he had someone look for her. Although she resembles her father and looks charming and friendly, she is not educated enough due to her upbringing and is an extremely fast-speaker. She became a laughingstock to the people around her. Her father treated her coldly and made her be a court lady for Empress Kokiden. She desired to be a Naishi no Kami (Principal Handmaid) and even did toilet cleaning. However, this had the opposite effect and caused her brothers to be unkind to her. Her position in the story is 'an object of ridicule' similar to Gen no Naishinosuke. She is fond of backgammon. </p>
<p>Lady Gosechi: A lady-in-waiting for Lady Omi. Similar to Omi, there is something flippant about her, and the author describes them as being merry while playing backgammon. She behaves as if she and Omi were friends. She is different from Koremitsu's daughter, Lady Gosechi (as mentioned below). <h3>Genji's political opponents</h3>
</p>
<p>Kokiden no nyogo (Lady Kokiden): Emperor Kiritsubo's wife and Emperor Suzaku's mother (later called Grand Empress Kokiden). Kiritsubo no Koi stole Emperor Kiritsubo's favor from Kokiden. Because of this, Kokiden feels hatred for Kiritsubo, Genji, whom she left behind, and Empress Fujitsubo. When Genji's secret affair with Oborozukiyo was laid bare, she took it as an opportunity to try to exile Genji, who withdrew to Suma. However, she was ultimately unable to make Genji lose his political position, and died a disappointed person. </p>
<p>The Udaijin: The Fujiwara clan. He is the father of Lady Kokiden, Oborozukiyo and others. At one time he intended to take Genji into his family as Oborozukiyo's husband. </p>
<p>Hyobukyo no Miya: Empress Fujitsubo's brother. He is Lady Murasaki's father. </p>
<p>Kita no kata (wife): Hyobukyo no Miya's lawful wife. She has strong hostile feelings towards her stepdaughter, Lady Murasaki. She had a strong influence on Hyobukyo no Miya, which became a factor in his becoming estranged from his daughter, and later, became the cause of his being opposed to Genji. <h3>Genji's retainers</h3>
</p>
<p>FUJIWARA no Koremitsu: Hikaru Genji's foster brother. In Genji's youth, he appeared frequently as an attendant on Genji's evening strolls and accompanied him even when he withdrew to Suma.
