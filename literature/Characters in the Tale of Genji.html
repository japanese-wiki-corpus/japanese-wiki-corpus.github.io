</p>
<p>Young <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Lady Akashi.html">Lady Akashi</a> (also called Empress <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Akashi (The Tale of Genji).html">Akashi</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Lady Akashi.html">Lady Akashi</a>): The eldest daughter of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Hikaru Genji.html">Hikaru Genji</a>.

</p>
<p>This is the family Genji entered into by marrying one of their daughters. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/The Fujiwara clan.html">The Fujiwara clan</a>. There is a vehement power struggle within the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Udaijin (Minister of the Right).html">Udaijin</a>'s family, who are of the same Fujiwara clan. Being Genji's guardian, his political stance during the reign of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Emperor Kiritsubo.html">Emperor Kiritsubo</a> was close to Genji's. Their relationship continued even after the death of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Lady Aoi.html">Lady Aoi</a>, when Genji requested that he look after <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Yugiri (The Tale of Genji).html">Yugiri</a>. Despite To no Chujo being the head of the family, he was always in competition with Genji for power and always failed to take it from him. Furthermore, when the story reaches the "ten chapters of Uji jujo" (the Ten Books of Uji), <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Kobai (The Rose Plum) (The Tale of Genji).html">Kobai</a> is the head of the family and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Yugiri (The Tale of Genji).html">Yugiri</a> has become the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Sadaijin (Minister of the Left).html">Sadaijin</a>. </p>
<p>While the lineage between Genji and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Emperor Reizei.html">Emperor Reizei</a> as a father and son is implied to be skill in pictures and painting, the Fujiwara clan regards music as their specialty. However, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Yugiri (The Tale of Genji).html">Yugiri</a> has a deeper knowledge and skill in music, which might be because he has a stronger relationship with the House of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Sadaijin (Minister of the Left).html">Sadaijin</a>. </p>
<p>To no Chujo: The son of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Sadaijin (Minister of the Left).html">Sadaijin</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Omiya (The Tale of Genji).html">Omiya</a>. He is lady Aoi's older maternal half-brother. Later he served as the Minister of the Palace and the Grand Minister. </p>

He is Genji's father-in-law. The head of the House of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Sadaijin (Minister of the Left).html">Sadaijin</a> of the Fujiwara clan. He has close relations with <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Emperor Kiritsubo.html">Emperor Kiritsubo</a> and Genji both in public and private. He was also Genji's guardian when Genji was young. When <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Emperor Reizei.html">Emperor Reizei</a> ascended to the throne, he was appointed as the Grand Minister (at the age of 63, in '<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Miotsukushi (The Tale of Genji).html">Miotsukushi</a>' (Channel Buoys)) at the request of Genji. He died at the age of 66. ('<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Usugumo.html">Usugumo</a>' (Wisps of Cloud)). </p>
<p><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Omiya (The Tale of Genji).html">Omiya</a>: <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Emperor Kiritsubo.html">Emperor Kiritsubo</a>'s sister and the lawful wife of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Sadaijin (Minister of the Left).html">Sadaijin</a>.

She was To no Chujo's lawful wife. She was estranged from her husband in her youth. She is the mother of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Kashiwagi (The Tale of Genji).html">Kashiwagi</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Kobai (The Rose Plum) (The Tale of Genji).html">Kobai</a> and Empress Kokiden. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Kashiwagi (The Tale of Genji).html">Kashiwagi</a>: The eldest son of To no Chujo (Minister of the Palace). He and his cousin <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Yugiri (The Tale of Genji).html">Yugiri</a> are good friends.
