</p>
<p>Young <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Lady Akashi.html">Lady Akashi</a> (also called Empress <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Akashi (The Tale of Genji).html">Akashi</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Lady Akashi.html">Lady Akashi</a>): The eldest daughter of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Hikaru Genji.html">Hikaru Genji</a>.

</p>
<p>This is the family Genji entered into by marrying one of their daughters. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/The Fujiwara clan.html">The Fujiwara clan</a>. There is a vehement power struggle within the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Udaijin (Minister of the Right).html">Udaijin</a>'s family, who are of the same Fujiwara clan. Being Genji's guardian, his political stance during the reign of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Emperor Kiritsubo.html">Emperor Kiritsubo</a> was close to Genji's. Their relationship continued even after the death of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Lady Aoi.html">Lady Aoi</a>, when Genji requested that he look after <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Yugiri (The Tale of Genji).html">Yugiri</a>. Despite To no Chujo being the head of the family, he was always in competition with Genji for power and always failed to take it from him.

<p>While the lineage between Genji and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Emperor Reizei.html">Emperor Reizei</a> as a father and son is implied to be skill in pictures and painting, the Fujiwara clan regards music as their specialty. However, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Yugiri (The Tale of Genji).html">Yugiri</a> has a deeper knowledge and skill in music, which might be because he has a stronger relationship with the House of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Sadaijin (Minister of the Left).html">Sadaijin</a>. </p>
<p>To no Chujo: The son of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Sadaijin (Minister of the Left).html">Sadaijin</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Omiya (The Tale of Genji).html">Omiya</a>.

He is Genji's father-in-law. The head of the House of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Sadaijin (Minister of the Left).html">Sadaijin</a> of the Fujiwara clan. He has close relations with <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Emperor Kiritsubo.html">Emperor Kiritsubo</a> and Genji both in public and private. He was also Genji's guardian when Genji was young. When <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Emperor Reizei.html">Emperor Reizei</a> ascended to the throne, he was appointed as the Grand Minister (at the age of 63, in '<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Miotsukushi (The Tale of Genji).html">Miotsukushi</a>' (Channel Buoys)) at the request of Genji. He died at the age of 66. ('<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Usugumo.html">Usugumo</a>' (Wisps of Cloud)). </p>
<p><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Omiya (The Tale of Genji).html">Omiya</a>: <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Emperor Kiritsubo.html">Emperor Kiritsubo</a>'s sister and the lawful wife of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Sadaijin (Minister of the Left).html">Sadaijin</a>.

She is the mother of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Kashiwagi (The Tale of Genji).html">Kashiwagi</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Kobai (The Rose Plum) (The Tale of Genji).html">Kobai</a> and Empress Kokiden. </p>
