<h1>Abutsuni (阿仏尼)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Abutsuni (1222 ? - May 13, 1283) was a female waka (traditional Japanese poem of thirty-one syllables) poet in the mid <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period. Her name as a court lady was Ankamonin no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Shijo.html">shijo</a>, and alternatively, Uemon no suke. Her biological father and mother are unknown. She was adopted by TAIRA no Norishige. However, there is also a view that says that she was a biological daughter, not an adopted daughter, of TAIRA no Norishige. </p>
<p>Brief Biography<br/>
She was serving <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Imperial Princess Kuniko.html">Imperial Princess Kuniko</a>, but because of the shock of a broken heart from her first love in her teens, she decided to enter the nunhood and became a nun. However, she continued to maintain her connection with the secular world. At the age of about 30 she became a concubine of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Tameie.html">FUJIWARA no Tameie</a>, and she gave birth to Tamesuke Reizei. After Tameie's death, she fought against his lawful wife's son, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Tameuji NIJO.html">Tameuji NIJO</a>, over the inheritance of Hosokawa no Sho in Harima Province (present-day Miki City, Hyogo Prefecture). In 1279, she went to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> in order to appeal to the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>). This trip, as well as her stay in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a>, are noted in 'Izayoi Nikki' (The Diary of the Sixteenth Night). There is a theory that holds that she died in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> before the court decision was made. There is also a theory that holds that she died after she returned to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. She participated in 'Koan Hyakushu' (One Hundred poems of the Koan Era). Also, there exist 'Ankamonin no Shijo Gohyakushu' (Five Hundred Poems of Ankamonin no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Shijo.html">Shijo</a>) as well as 'Ankamonin no Shijo Hyakushu' (One Hundred Poems of Ankamonin no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Shijo.html">Shijo</a>), which she dedicated to ten shrines in the Kanto region upon praying for her victory in the court case. </p>
<p>Her work was included in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Chokusen Wakashu.html">Chokusen Wakashu</a> (anthology of Japanese poetry compiled by Imperial command) after 'Shokukokin Wakashu' (Collection of Ancient and Modern Japanese Poetry Continued). She had a treatise on waka poetry called 'Yoru no Tsuru' (A Night Crane). Also, 'Utatane' (Fitful Slumbers) that she wrote in her youth is a diary noting details of her broken heart. </p>
