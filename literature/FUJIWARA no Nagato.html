<h1>FUJIWARA no Nagato (藤原長能)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>FUJIWARA no Nagato (949 - c. 1009) was a waka poet in the mid-Heian period. 
<br/>He is also called 'FUJIWARA no Nagayoshi.'<br/>
His father was FUJIWARA no Tomoyasu. His mother was a daughter of MINAMOTO no Mitomu. His elder paternal half-sister was the mother of FUJIWARA no Michitsuna, who is regarded as a female waka poet and one of the Chuko sanjurokkasen (medieval 36 Immortal Poets). His official court rank remained Jugoinojo (Junior Fifth Rank, Upper Grade), Iga no kuni no Kami (an officer in charge of regional administration in Iga). Nagato is also regarded as one of the Chuko sanjurokkasen. </p>
<p>It is thought that he was active in the poetry circle in the era of the Emperor Kazan and took part in compiling "Shui Wakashu" (Collection of Gleanings of Japanese Poems) of chokusen wakashu (anthologies of Japanese poetry compiled by Imperial command). His ten waka poems were selected for 'Gengen shu' compiled by his disciple Noin Priest. He presented the largest number of poems in this waka collection. His waka poems were selected for chokusen wakashu starting when 'Shui Wakashu' was compiled and onwards. He privately compiled "Nagato shu." </p>
