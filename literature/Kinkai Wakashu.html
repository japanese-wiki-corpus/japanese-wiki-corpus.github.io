<h1>Kinkai Wakashu (金槐和歌集)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kinkai Wakashu is <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Sanetomo.html">MINAMOTO no Sanetomo</a>'s private anthology in the early Kamakura Period. </p>
<p>A persuasive theory states that this anthology was completed around 1213 when a hereditary book of "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Manyoshu (Collection of Ten Thousand Leaves).html">Manyoshu</a>" (oldest anthology of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Tanka.html">tanka</a>) was given by FUJIWARA no Teika. It is one volume consisting of about 700 poetry. The kanji of "Kin" (金) is the same as the left half of kanji "鎌" of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> (鎌倉) and "kai" (槐) refers to "槐門 (kaimon, another name of minister), so Kinkai Wakashu is also called the private anthology of Kamakura Minister of the Right (Sanetomo). </p>
<p>A persuasive theory states that this anthology was compiled by Sanetomo himself. There are two traditions of this anthology, Teika shodenpon edition and Jokyo edition. This anthology contains many of very fine Manyo-style poetry. </p>
