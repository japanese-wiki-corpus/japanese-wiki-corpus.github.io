<p>FUJIWARA no Atsuyori (1090 - ca. 1182) was a court noble and poet in the late Heian period. His father was FUJIWARA no Kiyotaka, a sho (official) of the Jibu (the Office of Ceremonies). His mother was the daughter of FUJIWARA no Takanori, the governor of Nagato. His earlier career was unknown. He served as Umanosuke (Under-Secretary of the Office of Imperial Horses) and got to the rank of Jugoinojo (Junior Fifth Rank, Upper Grade). In 1172 he became a priest, christened Doin. He participated and submitted verses in major poetic contests held between 1160 and 1181.
