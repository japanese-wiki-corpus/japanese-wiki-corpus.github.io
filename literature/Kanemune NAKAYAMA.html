<h1>NAKAYAMA Kanemune (中山兼宗)</h1>
<p>Kanemune NAKAYAMA (1163 - October 5, 1242) was a court noble and a waka poet who lived in the Heian period. The oldest son of Inner Minister <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Tadachika NAKAYAMA.html">Tadachika NAKAYAMA</a>. His mother was <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Benkan (Collective name of posts in Daijokan).html">Benkan</a> (the Office of State officer) FUJIWARA no Mitsufusa's daughter. His lawful wife was a daughter of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/FUJIWARA no Shigeie.html">FUJIWARA no Shigeie</a> (Gyobukyo, Governor of the Justice Bureau). <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shonii.html">Shonii</a> (Senior Second Rank), Azechishi (Provincial Administrator), Junior Major Councillor.

As Council of State, he served concurrently as Director of procession of Daijoosai (the enthronement ceremony followed by the first Thanksgiving Ceremony of the new emperor), Junior Governor of Kaga Province, Chugushoku Daibu (Steward to the Empress (Risshi KUJO)) and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Azechi.html">Azechi</a> (inspector of the provincial government). In 1218, he recommended his son Tadasada for <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Sangi.html">Sangi</a>, and retired from <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Dainagon (chief councilor of state).html">Dainagon</a> (chief councilor of state), but two years after in 1220 he demanded Tadasada's resignation because of '子強好交衆, 又増不孝耳' (according to the entry dated April 9, 1229 (old calendar) in "<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Meigetsuki (The Record of the Clear Moon).html">Meigetsuki</a>" (Chronicle of the Bright Moon)), and the conflict between the father and son heated up. It turned into a big disturbance and Yoshimura MIURA and FUJIWARA no Teika had to mediate between these two people in 1233. In 1235, he became Controller of Osumi Province. On October 5 1242, he passed away at the age of eighty. </p>
<p>His works as a poet were as follows: one poem was collected in "<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Senzai Wakashu.html">Senzai Wakashu</a>" (Collection of a Thousand Years) (poem number 328); 20 poems were collected in the anthologies of Japanese poetry compiled by Imperial command after "Shin <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Kokin Wakashu (A Collection of Ancient and Modern Japanese Poetry).html">Kokin Wakashu</a>" (<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/New Collection of Ancient and Modern Poetry.html">New Collection of Ancient and Modern Poetry</a>), he joined poetry contests such as Wakamiya-sha shrine waka competition, six hundred verses waka competition, one thousand and five hundred verses waka competition, the Tsunefusa family waka competition in 1191. 
<br/>According to "Seiasho" volume 6, Teika said, 'Kanemune is a good poet who comes to a meeting in full dress and makes a poem as if he dealt with government affairs.'<br/>
In 1179, he first played so (a zheng) in New Year's days at <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Takakura.html">Emperor Takakura</a>'s Chokin <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Gyoko.html">gyoko</a> (Emperor's visit to the parent palace), and then he was appointed as Chief of Musical Department in 1194, serving as so and biwa (a Japanese lute) player at the various waka poetry gatherings. </p>
