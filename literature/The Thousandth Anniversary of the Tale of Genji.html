<h1>The Thousandth Anniversary of the Tale of Genji (源氏物語千年紀)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The thousandth anniversary of the Tale of Genji refers to various events held to commemorate a thousand years since the Tale of Genji was written. </p>
<p>Summary<br/>
The date is based on the appearance of phrases such as 'Wakamurasaki' (Lady Murasaki) and 'Genji' in the entry for December 7, 1008 of "Murasaki Shikibu nikki" (Diary of Lady Murasaki Shikibu). 2008 marked exactly a thousand years since records confirm that the Tale of Genji was being read. As it is considered 'an important date,' many events were held to commemorate it. </p>
