<h1>Otsu-e (Otsu paintings, named after the town of Otsu in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Shiga Prefecture.html">Shiga Prefecture</a>) (大津絵)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>In a collection at The Cleveland Museum of Art. </p>
<p>Otsu-e is a style of painting and local specialty which <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Otsu City.html">Otsu City</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Shiga Prefecture.html">Shiga Prefecture</a>, has been noted for from the early Edo period. The subject of these paintings varied, and among those who traveled Tokaido Gojusan-tsugi (53 stages in Tokai-do Road) the paintings were known as a souvenier or a charm. </p>
<p>The name of 'Otsu-e' is also used to refer to the original song, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Ongyoku (musical performance).html">ongyoku</a> (a popular old-style Japanese song accompanied by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Shamisen (a three-stringed Japanese banjo).html">shamisen</a> music), a folk song (Otsu-e <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bushi.html">bushi</a>) which shares the subject of Otsu-e, and also a kind of classical <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Japanese dance.html">Japanese dance</a> based on Otsu-e <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bushi.html">bushi</a> (Otsu-e dancing). </p>
<p><h3>History</h3>
</p>
<p>The birthplace of Otsu-e is Oiwake Station (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Higechaya-oiwake.html">Higechaya-oiwake</a> [Higashichaya bisection]) in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Omi Province.html">Omi Province</a> (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Shiga Prefecture.html">Shiga Prefecture</a>), which was to the west of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Osaka no seki (the Osaka Barrier).html">Osaka no seki</a> (the Osaka Barrier), Tokaido Gojusan-tsugi. During the Kanei era (1624-1644), Otsu-e began to be painted as Buddhist paintings. At first they were painted as a form of expressing one's faith, but before long they transformed into secular paintings, and since the 18th century, they came to be accompanied with educational and satirical didactic poems. </p>
<p>The early characteristics of Otsue which contained many Buddhist paintings are well expressed in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Haiku.html">haiku</a> by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Basho MATSUO.html">Basho MATSUO</a>, 'Various kinds of Buddha are drawn in Otsu-e, so which one will the painter draw in the New Year.'<br/>
Also, it is said that during the oppression of Christianity during the early Edo period, the Otsu-e were used as a perfect guise to say that 'I am a Buddhist.'<br/>
</p>
<p>Throughout the Edo period, they had been the specialty of Otsu-juku Station on the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Tokaido.html">Tokaido</a> road. 
<br/>During the eras of Bunka and Bunsei (1804-1829), the representative subjects of Otsu-e painting called 'Ten kinds of Otsu-e' were decided, meanwhile its effectiveness as a charm came to be advocated; ('Fujimusume' (wisteria maiden) is effective for helping find a good match, 'Ogre's reciting Buddhist invocations in midwinter' is to help babies crying at night, and '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Raijin (god of lightning).html">raijin</a> (the god of thunder) sugata katachi (form)' will prevent being struck by lightning, etc.)<br/>
The subjects of the paintings continued to increase, and reached its peak at the end of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Edo Period.html">Edo Period</a>. However, with the simplification of the subjects, there has been a decline, and now it is said that there are over 100 kinds of subjects. <h3>Features</h3>
</p>
<p>The gods, Buddha, people, and animals are painted humorously, and a didactic poem is added. In many paintings and didactic poems, human relationships and the teachings of society are expressed satirically. <h3>Major subjects</h3>
