<h1>Otsu-e (Otsu paintings, named after the town of Otsu in Shiga Prefecture) (大津絵)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>In a collection at The Cleveland Museum of Art. </p>
<p>Otsu-e is a style of painting and local specialty which Otsu City, Shiga Prefecture, has been noted for from the early Edo period. The subject of these paintings varied, and among those who traveled Tokaido Gojusan-tsugi (53 stages in Tokai-do Road) the paintings were known as a souvenier or a charm. </p>
<p>The name of 'Otsu-e' is also used to refer to the original song, ongyoku (a popular old-style Japanese song accompanied by shamisen music), a folk song (Otsu-e bushi) which shares the subject of Otsu-e, and also a kind of classical Japanese dance based on Otsu-e bushi (Otsu-e dancing). </p>
<p><h3>History</h3>
</p>
<p>The birthplace of Otsu-e is Oiwake Station (Higechaya-oiwake [Higashichaya bisection]) in Omi Province (Shiga Prefecture), which was to the west of Osaka no seki (the Osaka Barrier), Tokaido Gojusan-tsugi. During the Kanei era (1624-1644), Otsu-e began to be painted as Buddhist paintings. At first they were painted as a form of expressing one's faith, but before long they transformed into secular paintings, and since the 18th century, they came to be accompanied with educational and satirical didactic poems. </p>
<p>The early characteristics of Otsue which contained many Buddhist paintings are well expressed in the haiku by Basho MATSUO, 'Various kinds of Buddha are drawn in Otsu-e, so which one will the painter draw in the New Year.'<br/>
Also, it is said that during the oppression of Christianity during the early Edo period, the Otsu-e were used as a perfect guise to say that 'I am a Buddhist.'<br/>
</p>
<p>Throughout the Edo period, they had been the specialty of Otsu-juku Station on the Tokaido road. 
<br/>During the eras of Bunka and Bunsei (1804-1829), the representative subjects of Otsu-e painting called 'Ten kinds of Otsu-e' were decided, meanwhile its effectiveness as a charm came to be advocated; ('Fujimusume' (wisteria maiden) is effective for helping find a good match, 'Ogre's reciting Buddhist invocations in midwinter' is to help babies crying at night, and 'raijin (the god of thunder) sugata katachi (form)' will prevent being struck by lightning, etc.)<br/>
The subjects of the paintings continued to increase, and reached its peak at the end of the Edo Period. However, with the simplification of the subjects, there has been a decline, and now it is said that there are over 100 kinds of subjects. <h3>Features</h3>
</p>
<p>The gods, Buddha, people, and animals are painted humorously, and a didactic poem is added. In many paintings and didactic poems, human relationships and the teachings of society are expressed satirically. <h3>Major subjects</h3>
