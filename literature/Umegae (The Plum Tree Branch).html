<h1>Umegae (The Plum Tree Branch) (梅枝)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Umegae is one of the 54 chapters of "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/The Tale of Genji.html">The Tale of Genji</a>." It is the 32nd chapter. The title of this chapter was derived from saibara (a genre of Heian-period Japanese court music primarily consisting of gagaku-styled folk melodies) which Ben no shosho (the second son of To no Chujo, the first secretary's captain, later known as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kobai (The Rose Plum) (The Tale of Genji).html">Kobai</a>) sang. </p>
<p>Summary<br/>
<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Hikaru Genji.html">Hikaru Genji</a>, age 39, spring. </p>
<p>Genji hurried to prepare for young lady <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Akashi (The Tale of Genji).html">Akashi</a>'s Mogi (coming-of-age ceremony for girls), which was timed to coincide with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kinjo no Mikado.html">Kinjo no Mikado</a>'s coming of age ceremony. Genji asked his women to mix incense, and on a rainy day of February 10, he invited Hotaru Hyobukyonomiya to judge an incense competition. Every incense smelled so wonderful that even <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Hotaru (The Tale of Genji).html">Hotaru</a> no Miya could not decide which was better. 
<br/>At night, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Kangen.html">Kangen</a> (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Gagaku.html">gagaku</a> piece without dance) was held, and Ben no shosho, whose voice was beautiful, sang 'Umegae.'<br/>
</p>
<p>The following day, a splendid Mogi for young lady <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Akashi (The Tale of Genji).html">Akashi</a> was held, and Empress Akikonomu played the part of koshi-yui (a person who ties a band around the young woman's waist). Togu (the Crown Prince) was also looking forward to her coming, but Genji knew that other <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kugyo.html">Kugyo</a> (top court officials) hesitated to send their daughters to the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kokyu (empresss residence).html">kokyu</a> (Empress's residence), so he postponed her entrance. Genji settled her in Shigeisha (The Paulownia), and asked various people to make lovely calligraphy models and to furnish lavish goods. </p>
<p>The Minister of the Palace, who heard the rumor, was still worried about the treatment of Kumoi no Kari. Genji was also anxious about <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Yugiri (The Tale of Genji).html">Yugiri</a>, who had difficulty getting married, and encouraged him indirectly to marry another woman. Kumoi no Kari, who heard about it, was shocked and felt resentment at the indifference of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Yugiri (The Tale of Genji).html">Yugiri</a>, who did not tell her anything. </p>
