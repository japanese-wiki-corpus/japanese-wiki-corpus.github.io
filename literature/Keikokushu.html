<h1>Keikokushu (経国集)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Keikokushu is an anthology of Chinese poems compiled at the command of Emperor Junna in 827 during the early Heian period. This anthology consists of 20 volumes and was compiled by a number of people, including YOSHIMINE no Yasuyo and SUGAWARA no Kiyokimi. The writers included Emperor Junna, ISONOKAMI no Yakatsugu, OMI no Mifune and Kukai. Including the first volume, there are six volumes that remain in existence today. The existing Keikokushu is stored in Gunsho Ruiju (a collection of historical documents compiled by Hokiichi HANAWA). </p>
