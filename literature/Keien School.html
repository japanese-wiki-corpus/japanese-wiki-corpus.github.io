<h1>Keien School (桂園派)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Keien School is a school of Waka (Japanese poem) led by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kageki KAGAWA.html">Kageki KAGAWA</a> (1768-1843), a poet in the late Edo period. It was also a branch of the Nijo school that was passed on by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Sanenari SHIMIZUDANI.html">Sanenari SHIMIZUDANI</a>, a court noble from Tosho-ke (the hereditary lineage of Court nobles occupying relatively high ranks) to the Kagawa family of lower-class nobles. </p>
<p>While <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/KAMO no Mabuchi.html">KAMO no Mabuchi</a> (1679-1769) and the others emphasized the "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Manyoshu (Collection of Ten Thousand Leaves).html">Manyoshu</a>" (the oldest anthology of Japanese poetry), Kageki and his group preferred "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kokin Wakashu (A Collection of Ancient and Modern Japanese Poetry).html">Kokin Wakashu</a>" (A Collection of Ancient and Modern Japanese Poetry), and their poems were popular mainly in the Kinai region (provinces surrounding <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and Nara). Their style of poetry had respect for simplicity and focused on the rhythm of poetry. Disciples include Takafumi KINOSHITA and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Naoyoshi KUMAGAI.html">Naoyoshi KUMAGAI</a>, to name but a few, and it is said that this school survived to the early <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period. It is assumed, however, that this school still existed after the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period. </p>
