<h1>Sosei (素性)</h1>
<p>Sosei (dates of birth and death unknown, died in 910?) was a poet and a monk who lived during the early and middle Heian period. He was one of the Thirty-six Immortal Poets. His father was Sojo <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Henjo.html">Henjo</a> (YOSHIMINE no Munesada). There are various opinions about his secular name. According to one theory, it was YOSHIMINE no Harutoshi. The origin of the Yoshimine clan goes back to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/YOSHIMINE no Yasuyo.html">YOSHIMINE no Yasuyo</a>, who was the son of Emperor Kanmu, demoted from nobility to subject, therefore Sosei was a great-grandchild of Emperor Kanmu. He was born when his father <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Henjo.html">Henjo</a> was a layman, and seems to have been made to become a priest together with his older brother, Yusei. </p>
<p>Sosei took a lively part in composing waka poems as a monk who was close to the Imperial court together with his father, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Henjo.html">Henjo</a>. At first he served the Imperial court and was advanced to tenjobito (a high-ranking courtier allowed into the Imperial Palace), but retired to the priesthood when he was still young. When <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Imperial Prince Tsuneyasu.html">Imperial Prince Tsuneyasu</a>, a son of Emperor Ninmyo, became a priest and fixed his residence at the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Urin-in Temple.html">Urin-in Temple</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Henjo.html">Henjo</a> and Sosei were allowed to visit the prince. After the death of the prince, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Henjo.html">Henjo</a> was entrusted with management of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Urin-in Temple.html">Urin-in Temple</a>, and even after <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Henjo.html">Henjo</a> passed away, Sosei lived there and the temple was known as the place where the gatherings of waka poetry and Chinese poetry were held. Later, he moved to Ryoin-in Temple in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yamato.html">Yamato</a>. He was often invited to the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Uta-awase.html">uta-awase</a> (poetry contest) held by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Uda.html">Emperor Uda</a> and composed poems. </p>
<p>His poems were collected in the Imperial Anthologies such as Kokin shu (abbreviation for <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kokin Wakashu (A Collection of Ancient and Modern Japanese Poetry).html">Kokin Wakashu</a> - A Collection of Ancient and Modern Japanese Poetry), and one of his poems was also chosen for FUJIWARA no Teika's Ogura <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Hyakunin Isshu.html">Hyakunin Isshu</a> (the Ogura Anthology of One Hundred Tanka-poems by One Hundred Poets). His personal collection of poetry is "Sosei shu" (A Collection of Poems by Sosei) (the poems were selected by others). </p>
