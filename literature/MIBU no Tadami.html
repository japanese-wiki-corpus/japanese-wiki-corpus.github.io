<h1>MIBU no Tadami (壬生忠見)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>MIBU no Tadami (dates of birth and death unknown) was a Japanese poet of the mid-Heian period. His father was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MIBU no Tadamine.html">MIBU no Tadamine</a>. He changed his name to Nada (名多), later Tadami (忠実), and then Tadami (忠見). Both he and his father are counted among Sanjurokkasen (36 Immortal Poets). </p>
<p>His career is unknown except for the fact that he was appointed as Mizushidokoro Shoteigai Kashiwadebe (a post to take care of the emperor's food) in 954 and Daisakan (a fourth rank officer) of Settsu Province in 958. As a poet, he composed a poem for the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Dairi (the Imperial palace).html">Dairi</a> kiku <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Awase.html">awase</a> (Palace Chrysanthemum Contest) on November 953 and the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Dairi (the Imperial palace).html">Dairi</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Uta-awase.html">uta-awase</a> (Imperial Palace Poetry Contest) in 960, and took a lively part in composing byobu-uta (screen poems). </p>
<p>At the "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Tentoku Dairi Uta-awase.html">Tentoku Dairi Uta-awase</a>" (Imperial Palace Poetry Contest of the Tentoku era)<br/>
My reputation for being in love with someone has already spread, although I just began to love her secretly, without telling anything to anybody.' ("Shui Wakashu" (Collection of Gleanings of Japanese Poems) Love (1) 621, "One Hundred Poems by One Hundred Poets" 41)<br/>
</p>
<p>There is a famous anecdote included in "Fukuro zoshi" (Book of Folded Pages) that he composed the above poem and died in agony because he was beaten by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/TAIRA no Kanemori.html">TAIRA no Kanemori</a>. </p>
<p>However, the credibility of this story is doubtful because his personal collection has some poems composed on the theme of him growing old. </p>
<p>His poems were selected for chokusen wakashu (anthologies of poems collected by Imperial command) starting when "Gosen Wakashu" (Later selected collection of Japanese poetry) was compiled and onwards. He has a personal collection "Tadami shu." </p>
