<h1>Kaminoyonanayo (神世七代) (神世七代)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kaminoyonanayo is a general term for seven generations of deities who were born when heaven and earth were created in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Japanese Mythology.html">Japanese Mythology</a>. Or it refers to such an era. It is also described as 神代七代 in Japanese and is also called Tenjin Shichidai. </p>
<p>The way abstract deities are gradually divided into a man and a woman, become aware of the opposite sex and eventually find love which leads to marriage is said to imply how the bodies and sexes of a man and a woman are properly differentiated. </p>
