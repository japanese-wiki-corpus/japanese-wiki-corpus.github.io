<h1>Kaminoyonanayo (神世七代) (神世七代)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kaminoyonanayo is a general term for seven generations of deities who were born when heaven and earth were created in Japanese Mythology. Or it refers to such an era. It is also described as 神代七代 in Japanese and is also called Tenjin Shichidai. </p>
<p>The way abstract deities are gradually divided into a man and a woman, become aware of the opposite sex and eventually find love which leads to marriage is said to imply how the bodies and sexes of a man and a woman are properly differentiated. </p>
<p>Kojiki (The Records of Ancient Matters)<br/>
In Kojiki, Kaminoyonanayo are Junihashira nanayo no kami (Twelve deities of seven generations) who appeared after Kotoamatsukami (Literally, Separate heavenly kami). There is one deity in each of the first two generations, and there are two deities in each of the third or later generations, and so the total number of generations becomes seven. </p>
