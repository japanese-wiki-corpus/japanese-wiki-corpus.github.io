<h1>The Shinshicho (新思潮)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The Shinshicho (New Tides of Thought) is a Japanese literary magazine. It was launched in 1907 by Kaoru OSANAI, and the publication has been carried on as a dojinshi (hobby magazine) at the University of Tokyo. In particular, the contributors to the third and fourth runs of Shinshicho such as Kan KIKUCHI, Ryunosuke AKUTAGAWA, Masao KUME and Yuzuru MATSUOKA were called the Shinshicho School, and became one of the bases for literature in the Taisho period. </p>
