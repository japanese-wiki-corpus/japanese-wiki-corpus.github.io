<h1>Kikki (吉記)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kikki is a diary written by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Tsunefusa YOSHIDA.html">Tsunefusa YOSHIDA</a> (1142-1200), a court noble who lived in the late Heian period. </p>
<p>Tsunefusa was from Kajuji line of the Fujiwara clan (commonly known as the 'house of diary'). He was a son of Junior Middle Executive Officer of the Right FUJIWARA no Mitsufusa, and built his second residence at Yoshida, the eastern suburb of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, so he was called 'Yoshida Junior Middle Councillor' and became a founder of the Yohisda family. Tsunefusa's diary was later called "Kikki" after his last name Yoshida (the letter for Yoshi (吉) is also pronounced Kitsu). It is sometimes called "Kikkoki" because a Chinese name for Tsunefusa's title Minbukyo (Director of Popular Affairs Bureau) was Koho. </p>
<p>The diary is said to have covered 28 years from 1166 to 1193, but the original manuscript is not extant, and the copied manuscript (most of them were collected or copied by his descendant <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Chikanaga KANROJI.html">Chikanaga KANROJI</a>) and some lost documents which were cited in other books make only 13-year fragmentary records. As well as the diaries written by other court nobles in the Kajuji line or 'house of diary,' it has detailed records of ceremonies and rituals in the Imperial court. Covering the era of the Jisho-Juei War, it is an important historical material to know the movement of the Imperial court in that time. Because Tsunefusa held positions of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kurodo (Chamberlain).html">Kurodo</a> gashira (Head of the Imperial Secretary Office) and In-Betto (chief of the retired Emperor's palace) during the disturbance and knew well the decisions made by the Imperial court, "Kikki" has more detailed records than "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Gyokuyo.html">Gyokuyo</a>," a diary written by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kanezane KUJO.html">Kanezane KUJO</a>, who was not a leading figure in the Imperial court yet at that time. </p>
