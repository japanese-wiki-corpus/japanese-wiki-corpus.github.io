<h1>Takekunikoriwake no mikoto (武国凝別命)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Takekunikoriwake no mikoto was a member of the Imperial Family in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kofun period (tumulus period).html">Kofun period</a> (tumulus period), and he was written about in "A Record of Ancient Matters," "Chronicles of Japan," and so on. He was Takekunikoriwake no oji. He was the 12th Prince of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Keiko.html">Emperor Keiko</a>. His mother was a daughter of Kikoto ABE, Takatahime. It is said that he was dispatched to Kanno-gun (later Nii County, present Niihama City, Saijo City, etc., Ehime Prefecture) for the subjugation of Iyo Province and used there as his base. His descendants spread out around Japan. Because the place was governed by their descendants (called "shi-son" in Japanese) of Takekunikoriwake no mikoto (also called "Betsu"), the place name "Besshi" was coined. The spirit of Takekunikoriwake no mikoto has been revered for generations at Isono-jinja Shrine.
