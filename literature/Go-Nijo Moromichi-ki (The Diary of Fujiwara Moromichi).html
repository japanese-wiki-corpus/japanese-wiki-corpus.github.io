<h1>Go-Nijo Moromichi-ki (The Diary of Fujiwara Moromichi) (後二条師通記)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Go-Nijo Moromichi-ki (The Diary of Fujiwara Moromichi) is a diary written by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Moromichi.html">FUJIWARA no Moromichi</a>, who was active during the late Heian period. The original manuscript has been handed down in the Ichijo family. It was also called the Gonijo kanpaku ki and the Gonijo-dono ki. It seems to have been written from 1083 to 1099, but some of the years are missing. A partial manuscript for 1093 in his own handwriting has been handed down. This manuscript in his own hand, together with an old manuscript copied later by the order of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Yorinaga.html">FUJIWARA no Yorinaga</a>, have been handed down in the Yomei bunko, and both are designated as national treasures. The Imperial Household Archives also has a newer manuscript that seems to have been copied at a later date than the old manuscript. There are contemporary diaries such as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Chuyuki.html">Chuyuki</a> (Diary of a Court Official) (written by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Munetada.html">FUJIWARA no Munetada</a>), and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Tokinoriki.html">Tokinoriki</a> (written by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/TAIRA no Tokinori.html">TAIRA no Tokinori</a>), etc. </p>
