<h1>Go-Nijo Moromichi-ki (The Diary of Fujiwara Moromichi) (後二条師通記)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Go-Nijo Moromichi-ki (The Diary of Fujiwara Moromichi) is a diary written by FUJIWARA no Moromichi, who was active during the late Heian period. The original manuscript has been handed down in the Ichijo family. It was also called the Gonijo kanpaku ki and the Gonijo-dono ki. It seems to have been written from 1083 to 1099, but some of the years are missing. A partial manuscript for 1093 in his own handwriting has been handed down. This manuscript in his own hand, together with an old manuscript copied later by the order of FUJIWARA no Yorinaga, have been handed down in the Yomei bunko, and both are designated as national treasures. The Imperial Household Archives also has a newer manuscript that seems to have been copied at a later date than the old manuscript. There are contemporary diaries such as Chuyuki (Diary of a Court Official) (written by FUJIWARA no Munetada), and Tokinoriki (written by TAIRA no Tokinori), etc. </p>
