<h1>KI no Tsurayuki (紀貫之)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>KI no Tsurayuki (866 or 872? - June 19, 945?) was a poet and essayist from the early to the middle Heian period. He was one of the 36 immortal poets. KI no Tomonori was his cousin. 
<br/>Male<br/>
His childhood name was Akokuso. </p>
<p><h3>Overview</h3>
</p>
<p>In 905, by order of Emperor Daigo, he compiled "Kokinwakashu (Collection of Ancient and Modern)," the first collection of poems by imperial command, with KI no Tomonori, MIBU no Tadamine and OSHIKOCHI no Mitsune, and wrote the kanajo (preface written in Hiragana). 
<br/>It began with the following line, which exerted a great influence on posterity: 'Waka has its roots in the human heart and flourishes in the myriad leaves of words.'<br/>
</p>
<p>Also, his waka poem was collected in "Ogura Hyakunin Isshu (A Hundred Poems by a Hundred Poets)" (I'm not sure whether your mind is the same as before; however the Japanese plum, which I know well because I've been here several times, blooms finely and perfumes sweetly to welcome me; would you come around to help me stay up for the night?). </p>
<p>As an essayist, he is well known for writing "The Tosa Diary." In the time when it was common for men to write in Chinese characters, he pretended to be a woman and wrote, in Hiragana, a journal of his journey from Tosa Province to Kyoto. That is why the narrator of the diary is a woman. In the history of Japanese literature, it was probably the first prose written in Hiragana, and it had a great influence on the later literature of diaries and essays, contributing to the development of literature by female authors. <h3>Chronology</h3>

</p>
<p>If it starts to haze and snow in spring, it looks like flowers are falling down in a village with no flowers (Kokin 9). </p>
<p>Will the wind of today, the first day of spring, melt down the frozen water that made my sleeves wet when I scooped? (Kokin 2)<br/>
</p>
<p>I'm not sure whether your mind is the same as before; however, the Japanese plum, which I know well because I've been here several times, blooms finely and perfumes sweetly to welcome me; would you come around to help me stay up for the night? (Hyakunin Isshu 35)<br/>
</p>
<p>I have fallen in love as fast and rushing as the water of Yoshinogawa River goes among rocks with great splashing (Kokin 471). </p>
