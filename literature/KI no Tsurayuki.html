<h1>KI no Tsurayuki (紀貫之)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>KI no Tsurayuki (866 or 872? - June 19, 945?) was a poet and essayist from the early to the middle Heian period. He was one of the 36 immortal poets. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/KI no Tomonori.html">KI no Tomonori</a> was his cousin. 
<br/>Male<br/>
His childhood name was Akokuso. </p>
<p><h3>Overview</h3>
</p>
<p>In 905, by order of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Daigo.html">Emperor Daigo</a>, he compiled "Kokinwakashu (Collection of Ancient and Modern)," the first collection of poems by imperial command, with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/KI no Tomonori.html">KI no Tomonori</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MIBU no Tadamine.html">MIBU no Tadamine</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/OSHIKOCHI no Mitsune.html">OSHIKOCHI no Mitsune</a>, and wrote the kanajo (preface written in Hiragana). 
<br/>It began with the following line, which exerted a great influence on posterity: 'Waka has its roots in the human heart and flourishes in the myriad leaves of words.'<br/>
</p>
<p>Also, his waka poem was collected in "Ogura <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Hyakunin Isshu.html">Hyakunin Isshu</a> (A Hundred Poems by a Hundred Poets)" (I'm not sure whether your mind is the same as before; however the Japanese plum, which I know well because I've been here several times, blooms finely and perfumes sweetly to welcome me; would you come around to help me stay up for the night?). </p>
<p>As an essayist, he is well known for writing "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/The Tosa Diary.html">The Tosa Diary</a>." In the time when it was common for men to write in Chinese characters, he pretended to be a woman and wrote, in Hiragana, a journal of his journey from Tosa Province to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. That is why the narrator of the diary is a woman. In the history of Japanese literature, it was probably the first prose written in Hiragana, and it had a great influence on the later literature of diaries and essays, contributing to the development of literature by female authors. <h3>Chronology</h3>

</p>
<p>If it starts to haze and snow in spring, it looks like flowers are falling down in a village with no flowers (Kokin 9). </p>
<p>Will the wind of today, the first day of spring, melt down the frozen water that made my sleeves wet when I scooped? (Kokin 2)<br/>
</p>
<p>I'm not sure whether your mind is the same as before; however, the Japanese plum, which I know well because I've been here several times, blooms finely and perfumes sweetly to welcome me; would you come around to help me stay up for the night? (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Hyakunin Isshu.html">Hyakunin Isshu</a> 35)<br/>
</p>
<p>I have fallen in love as fast and rushing as the water of Yoshinogawa River goes among rocks with great splashing (Kokin 471). </p>
