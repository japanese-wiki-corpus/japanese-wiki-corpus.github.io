<h1>FUKAKUSA no Shosho (Major General) (深草少将)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>FUKAKUSA no Shosho is a character who appears in a legend about <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/ONO no Komachi.html">ONO no Komachi</a>, 'Coming-and-going in a Hundred Nights,' which was created by Noh authors such as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Zeami.html">Zeami</a> during the Muromachi period. His residence was apparently located in the land of the present Gonjo-ji Temple (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Fushimi Ward.html">Fushimi Ward</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>). </p>
<p>By the pond in the Gonjo-ji Temple there is a 'path Shosho walked,' and tradition has it that if those who are in litigation walk the path, they will lose their cases. In addition, there is a stone tower for the consolation of FUKAKUSA no Shosho, along with one for <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/ONO no Komachi.html">ONO no Komachi</a>. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Zuishin-in Temple.html">Zuishin-in Temple</a> (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Yamashina Ward.html">Yamashina Ward</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>) has a Fumizuka (burial mound of drafts for commemoration) in which the letters written by FUKAKUSA no Shosho were buried. It is said that he loved <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/ONO no Komachi.html">ONO no Komachi</a>, and she told him that if he kept visiting her for one hundred days, she would marry him, but on a snowy day, the ninety-ninth night, he froze to death under the snow. </p>
