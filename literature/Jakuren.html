<h1>Jakuren (寂蓮)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Jakuren (ca. 1139-August 9, 1202) was a poet and a monk who lived from the end of the Heian period to the beginning of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period. His secular name was FUJIWARA no Sadanaga. </p>
<p>He was born to the priest <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shunkai.html">Shunkai</a>, and around 1150 he was adopted by his uncle <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Toshinari.html">FUJIWARA no Toshinari</a>, growing up to have <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Jugoi (Junior Fifth Rank) (a rank in Japan).html">Jugoi</a> (Junior Fifth Rank) and work at the Ministry of Central Affairs. However, when Toshinari had his own son, FUJIWARA no Teika, he became a priest in his thirties, devoting himself to the art of waka poetry. He played an important role as a leading poet in the Mikohidari family, and a controversy with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kensho.html">Kensho</a> in the 'Roppyakuban utaawase' (The Poetry Match in 600 Rounds), which is called 'controversy between Tokko (an implement pointed at both ends) and Kamakubi (gooseneck)' is famous. He became wakadokoro yoryudo (a key member of waka house) and then a selector of "Shin <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kokin Wakashu (A Collection of Ancient and Modern Japanese Poetry).html">Kokin Wakashu</a>" (New Collection of Ancient and Modern Japanese Poetry), but he passed away in 1202 before the anthology was completed. </p>
<p>His 117 poems were selected for "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Senzai Wakashu.html">Senzai Wakashu</a>" (Collection of Japanese Poetry of a Thousand Years) and other successive <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Chokusen Wakashu.html">Chokusen Wakashu</a> (anthology of Japanese poetry compiled by Imperial command). His personal collection on poetry is "Jakuren <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Hoshi.html">Hoshi</a> shu." </p>
