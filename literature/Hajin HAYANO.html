<h1>Hajin HAYANO (早野巴人)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Hajin HAYANO (1676 - July 7, 1742) was a poet of haiku (a Japanese poem in 17 syllables having a 5-7-5 syllabic form and traditionally containing a reference to the seasons) who lived during the Edo period. He was a mentor of Buson YOSA. Later he called himself Soa YAHANTEI. </p>
<p><h3>Brief Personal History</h3>
</p>
<p>Born in Karasuyama, Nasu County, Shimotsuke Province (the present Nasukarasuyama City, Tochigi Prefecture). There is an opinion that he was born in 1677. </p>
<p>When he was young (around nine years old), he went to Edo and was determined to learn haikai (popular linked verse). 
<br/>In 1689, he traveled along Basho MATSUO's 'Narrow Road to the Deep North.'<br/>
</p>
<p>He returned to Edo again, and studied haikai under Kikaku TAKARAI and Ransetsu HATTORI. </p>
<p>In 1727, he moved to Kyoto. </p>
<p>Encouraged by Ganto ISAOKA, he returned to Edo in 1737, and set up Yahantei at Hongoku-cho, Nihonbashi. At this time he decided to call himself Soa. Buson YOSA, who had just arrived at Edo, became his pupil around this time. </p>
<p>He died of disease on July 7, 1742. Died at the age of 67. 
<br/>His farewell poem was 'I'm not sure whether a paradise awaits in the far west or not.'<br/>
