<h1>Hanazono Tenno Shinki (The Records of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Hanazono.html">Emperor Hanazono</a>) (花園天皇宸記)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Hanazono Tenno Shinki is a diary of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Hanazono.html">Emperor Hanazono</a>. </p>
<p>The diary covers twenty three years from October 1310 to November 1332 (old calendar). It is an important historical material in the late <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Hanazono.html">Emperor Hanazono</a> himself called this diary "Tokanki." 
<br/>Although there are many variant titles such as "Emperor Hanazono Diary" and "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Hanazono (Kyoto City).html">Hanazono</a> in Shinki," the book was entered under the title of "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Hanazono (Kyoto City).html">Hanazono</a> in Shinki" in "A Complete Catalogue of Books in Japanese" (published by Iwanami Shoten)<br/>
There are three kinds of reprinted books as follows (in the order of published date): "Ressei <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Zenshu.html">Zenshu</a>" (Complete Works of Canonized People), (Ressei Zenshu Compilation Committee, 1915-1917, based on the treasured books of old families), "Grand Collection of Historical Materials, Continued" 33, 34 (Naigai Shoseki, 1938, mostly based on "Ressei <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Zenshu.html">Zenshu</a>"), and "Historical Materials Compiled" 62, 66, 80, (Classified Documents, Continued Completing Committee, 1982-1986, based on the book owned by the Archive and Mausolea Department, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Imperial Household Agency.html">Imperial Household Agency</a>). A Supplement to the "Grand Collection of Historical Materials" (volume 2 and 3) published by the Rinsen Book Co. in 1965 was almost like a reprinted edition of "Grand Collection of Historical Materials." </p>
<p>Most of the extant manuscripts were written in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Hanazono.html">Emperor Hanazono</a>'s own hand. It is an essential historical material to study Emperor Godaigo's activities because of its rich and detailed records on the Shochu Incident and Genko Incident. </p>
