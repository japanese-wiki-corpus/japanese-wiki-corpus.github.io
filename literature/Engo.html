<p>Examples<br/>

<br/>A waka by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Koshikibu no Naishi.html">Koshikibu no Naishi</a>:<br/>
</p>
<p>Oeyama ikunonomichi no tookereba mada "fumi" mo mizu ama no "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Hashidate (a train).html">hashidate</a>" (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Mt. Oe.html">Mt. Oe</a> and the road that goes to Ikuno are far away, so I have neither seen a "letter" from, nor "travelled by foot" there to Amano "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Hashidate (a train).html">hashidate</a>" [In this poem, "fumi" means both a "letter" and to "travel by foot," and although Amano-Hashidate is a place, the "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Hashidate (a train).html">hashidate</a>" is also a reference to the "ladder" to heaven])<br/>
A waka by Imperial Princess Shikishi:<br/>
</p>
<p>Tamano "o" yo "tae" nabataene "nagaraheba" shinoburukoto no "yowari" mozosuru (Let the "cord" of my life be "snapped" if it has to be; Were it "prolonged," it would "fray" as I would not be able to hide this love any longer [In this poem, the "o" refers to both a "cord" and "life," "tae" means to "die out"])<br/>
