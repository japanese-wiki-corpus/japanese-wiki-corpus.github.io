<h1>The Unkoku school (雲谷派)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The Unkoku school is a school of painting in the Edo period that was started by its founder Togan UNKOKU. They were very active in the Chugoku and northern Kyushu regions. Among them were: Togan UNKOKU and Tooku UNKOKU who served Terumoto MORI, Toeki UNKOKU who served Masanori FUKUSHIMA, and Toji UNKOKU and 雲谷等遮 during the Edo period. </p>
<p>Apart from standard landscapes painted in Indian ink in the tradition of Sesshu, there are also some works with painted flowers and birds as their subject matter. They announced themselves as Sesshu's direct successors, and eagerly copied and studied his works. </p>
