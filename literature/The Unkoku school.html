Among them were: Togan UNKOKU and Tooku UNKOKU who served Terumoto MORI, Toeki UNKOKU who served <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Masanori FUKUSHIMA.html">Masanori FUKUSHIMA</a>, and Toji UNKOKU and 雲谷等遮 during the Edo period. </p>
<p><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Apart (Apartment).html">Apart</a> from standard landscapes painted in Indian ink in the tradition of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Sesshu.html">Sesshu</a>, there are also some works with painted flowers and birds as their subject matter.
