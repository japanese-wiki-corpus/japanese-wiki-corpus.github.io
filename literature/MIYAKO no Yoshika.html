<h1>MIYAKO no Yoshika (都良香)</h1>
<p>MIYAKO no Yoshika (834 - March 25, 879) was a literatus and kanshi (Chinese verse) poet who lived in the early Heian period. His father's name was Sadatsugu KUWABARA. His real name was Kotomichi. </p>
<p>After passing the Taisaku (a type of employment examination for officials under Japan's Ritsuryo system), following his posts as Shonaiki (assistant editor) and assistant to the envoy from the Korean kingdom of Bohai, he reached the Jugoinoge (Junior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade) of Monjo hakase (chief calligrapher of the court) and Dainaiki (chief editor). He showed preeminent literary talent, drafting not only waka and Chinese poems but also quite a few Imperial rescripts and Kanpu (official documents of the Council of State). He participated in the compilation and editing of the 'Nihon montoku tenno jitsuroku' (Record of the Reign of Emperor Montoku of Japan, usually shortened to Montoku Jitsuroku), but died before the work was complete. He is known for several famous literary compositions, including his personal literary collection, the 'Toshi bunshu' (the Miyako clan Literary Collection) as well as Imperial Rescripts and questions for the Taisaku. Also, anecdotes concerning Yoshika can be found in the 'Honcho shinsenden' (Lives of the Spirit Immortals of Japan) and the 'Jikkinsho' (Selected Stories Illustrating the Ten Maxims). His Chinese poems were included in the 'Wakan Roeishu' (Collection of Sung Japanese and Chinese poems) and the 'Shinsen Roeishu' (New Selected Sung Poems), among other anthologies. </p>
