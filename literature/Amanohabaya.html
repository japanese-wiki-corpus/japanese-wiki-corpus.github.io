<h1>Amanohabaya (天羽々矢)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Amanohabaya is an arrow described in the "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kojiki (The Records of Ancient Matters).html">Kojiki</a>" (The Records of Ancient Matters), "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan).html">Nihonshoki</a>" (Chronicles of Japan) and mythology. The meaning of "haba" is unknown, although prevailing theories state that the word means "big for a feather" or "a large snake." When Takamimusuhi no Kami (the god Takamimusuhi) sent Amewakahiko down to the Ashihara no Nakatsukuni (literally, the Central Land of Reed Plains, which refers to the human world), Amanohabaya was given to Amewakahiko together with the bow called Amanokagoyumi (for details, refer to "pacification of Ashihara no Nakatsukuni"). </p>
<p>When Emperor Jinmu set off on the eastern expedition, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Nagasunehiko.html">Nagasunehiko</a> showed Amanohabaya owned by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Nigihayahi.html">Nigihayahi</a> no Mikoto to the emperor to prove that he was serving Amatsu Kami (god of heaven), but <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Nagasunehiko.html">Nagasunehiko</a> was killed by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Nigihayahi.html">Nigihayahi</a> no Mikoto. </p>
