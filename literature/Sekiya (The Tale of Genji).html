It is the 16th chapter. The title of this chapter refers to a barrier keeper's lodge at Osaka no Seki (the Osaka Barrier). </p>
<p>Summary<br/>
This chapter concerns the autumn when <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Hikaru Genji.html">Hikaru Genji</a> was 29. </p>
<p>A year after Genji returned to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, the Lord of Hitachi Province (formerly the Assistant Governor of Iyo Province) wound up his service and came back with his wife, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Utsusemi (The Tale of Genji).html">Utsusemi</a>. Genji, who was on his way to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Ishiyama-dera Temple.html">Ishiyama-dera Temple</a>, met <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Utsusemi (The Tale of Genji).html">Utsusemi</a>'s party at Osaka no Seki (the Osaka Barrier). Recalling their time together, Genji called over <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Utsusemi (The Tale of Genji).html">Utsusemi</a>'s younger brother, Uemon no suke (formerly Kogimi) and gave him a letter to give to her. They continued to exchange letters, but before long the Lord of Hitachi passed away, and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Utsusemi (The Tale of Genji).html">Utsusemi</a>, who was left alone, became a nun to avoid her stepchild, the Governor of Kawachi Province (the former Governor of Ki Province), who was in love with her. </p>
