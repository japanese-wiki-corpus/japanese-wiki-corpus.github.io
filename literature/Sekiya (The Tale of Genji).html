<h1>Sekiya (The Tale of Genji) (関屋 (源氏物語))</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Sekiya (The Gatehouse) is one of the 54 chapters of "The Tale of Genji." It is the 16th chapter. The title of this chapter refers to a barrier keeper's lodge at Osaka no Seki (the Osaka Barrier). </p>
<p>Summary<br/>
This chapter concerns the autumn when Hikaru Genji was 29. </p>
<p>A year after Genji returned to Kyoto, the Lord of Hitachi Province (formerly the Assistant Governor of Iyo Province) wound up his service and came back with his wife, Utsusemi. Genji, who was on his way to Ishiyama-dera Temple, met Utsusemi's party at Osaka no Seki (the Osaka Barrier). Recalling their time together, Genji called over Utsusemi's younger brother, Uemon no suke (formerly Kogimi) and gave him a letter to give to her. They continued to exchange letters, but before long the Lord of Hitachi passed away, and Utsusemi, who was left alone, became a nun to avoid her stepchild, the Governor of Kawachi Province (the former Governor of Ki Province), who was in love with her. </p>
