<h1>Kanginshu (閑吟集)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kanginshu is a collection of Japanese songs and ballads. It was compiled in 1518. This collection was compiled by a reclusive priest (hermit). 
<br/>Kanginshu contains 311 ballads that depict lively feelings of people in the Muromachi Period, including a poem that presents a widespread attitude of the time to live only for the pleasure of the moment: 'What to do with you, so serious, so sane? This life is a dream, just play, go crazy!' and a tanka (thirty-one syllables' poem) with a view of life as something transient and empty 'The world goes by just in a flicker of time, in a twinkling.'<br/>
