<p></p>
<p>ARIWARA no Motokata (year of birth and death unknown) was a waka poet in the Heian period. His father was one of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Chuko (periodization).html">Chuko</a> sanjurokkasen (medieval 36 Immortal Poets) <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/ARIWARA no Muneyana.html">ARIWARA no Muneyana</a>, and his grandfather was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/ARIWARA no Narihira.html">ARIWARA no Narihira</a> who was one of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Rokkasen (six famous poets).html">Rokkasen</a> (six best waka poets) and one of the Sanjurokkasen (36 Immortal Poets). </p>

He privately compiled 'Motokata shu,' but it has been transmitted only in fragments. </p>
