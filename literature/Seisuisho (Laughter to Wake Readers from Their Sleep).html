<h1>Seisuisho (Laughter to Wake Readers from Their Sleep) (醒睡笑)</h1>
<p>Seisuisho is a collection of comical stories which widely circulated among the common people. The author was Anrakuan Sakuden, who was a priest in the capital (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>) and was also known as a tea master and a cultured person. It consists of eight volumes and contains 1039 stories. 
<br/>The book was named "Seisuisho," which means 'waking people up and laughing.'<br/>
Some material says that it was completed in 1623 when the title of the book was decided, while other material says that it came into existence in 1628, when it was dedicated to Shigemune ITAKURA, who will be mentioned later, and an afterward to the book was written. There is a variant title of 'Seisuisho' which was written with Chinese characters "醒酔笑," but it's not authentic. </p>
<p>Summary<br/>
In an introduction by Sakuden he says, 'I wrote down on wastepaper the funny stories I have heard since I was little,' explaining how the stories came to be collected. Of the collected stories, some derived from "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Mumyosho.html">Mumyosho</a>" (The Nameless Treatise) and "Ujishui <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Monogatari.html">Monogatari</a>" (A Collection of Tales from Uji), and some are the same stories as the ones collected in "Zagenyokishu" (A Collection of Jokes Which Cheer You Up) and "Yesterday Is Today's Story" which were published in the same period. It is unknown whether Sakuden quoted those stories or just chose them from the ones widely known among the people. </p>
<p>It is said that Sakuden came to write "Seisuisho" around 1615 when Shigemune ITAKURA recommended him compiling those stories into a book because Shigemune found Sakuden's stories interesting. When Sakuden completed Seisuisho and brought it to Shigemune (on April 21, 1628), the book was presented to Shigemune's son, Shigesato ITAKURA (chamberlain Itakura) (Although in in fact it was presented to Shigemune). This was written by Shigemune in the afterward of the book. </p>
<p>Influence<br/>
"Seisuisho" had an influence on the later hanashibon (humorous stories) and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Rakugo (Japanese Traditional Comic Storytelling, or the Comic Story Itself).html">rakugo</a> (comic storytelling). For example, of 88 stories written in "Comic Storytelling of Tsuyu" (1691) by TSUYU no Gorobe I, 28 stories were based on Seisuisho. That is why Sakuden is said to be a founder of the early modern <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Rakugo (Japanese Traditional Comic Storytelling, or the Comic Story Itself).html">rakugo</a>. Even today some stories with comic endings based on "Seisuisho" like A Flattered Baby are performed. As mentioned in the articles about <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kohechi.html">Kohechi</a> and Ohechi (old roads to Kumano), it is used as an important historical material today. </p>
