<h1>Honkatori (本歌取)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Honkatori is a technique used to create waka (a traditional Japanese poem of thirty-one syllables) in the study of Japanese poems to take in one or two phrases of old and famous poem (the original) to create a new poem. This technique was used to give depth by using the original as a background and to make the expressive effect multilayered. </p>
<p>For example, see the poems below:<br/>
"<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kokin Wakashu (A Collection of Ancient and Modern Japanese Poetry).html">Kokin Wakashu</a>" (A Collection of Ancient and Modern Japanese Poetry) Volume 2, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/KI no Tsurayuki.html">KI no Tsurayuki</a><br/>
Miwayama no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shika.html">Shika</a> mo kakusu ka Harugasumi Hito ni shirarenu Hanaya sakuran' (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Mt. Miwa (a cone-shaped gentle mountain in Sakurai City, Nara Prefecture).html">Mt. Miwa</a> is hidden so deeply by spring haze; Flowers that no one knows must be blossoming.)<br/>
</p>
<p>"<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Manyoshu (Collection of Ten Thousand Leaves).html">Manyoshu</a>" (Collection of Ten Thousand Leaves) Volume 1, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Nukata no Okimi.html">Nukata no Okimi</a><br/>
Miwayama no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shika.html">Shika</a> mo kakusu ka Kumo danimo Kokoro aranamo Kakusoubeshi ya' (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Mt. Miwa (a cone-shaped gentle mountain in Sakurai City, Nara Prefecture).html">Mt. Miwa</a> is hidden so deeply by clouds; Please be merciful, clouds, do not hide.)<br/>
</p>
<p>As it is clear if you compare these two poems, Tsurayuki adopted the first and second phrases of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Nukata no Okimi.html">Nukata no Okimi</a>'s poem and created the third and the rest by himself. </p>
<p>There are various reactions to such honkatori. 
<br/><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/FUJIWARA no Kiyosuke.html">FUJIWARA no Kiyosuke</a> of Rokujo Toke (the Rokujo Fujiwara family) made critical assessment as 'stealing old poems.'<br/>
On the other hand, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Toshinari.html">FUJIWARA no Toshinari</a> of the Mikohidari family evaluated it as an expression technique. </p>
<p>FUJIWARA no Teika, a child of Toshinari, summarized the principle of honkatori as follows in "Kindai shuka" (Superior poems of our time) and "Eiga taigai" (Essentials of Poetic Composition):<br/>
</p>
<p>You can take less than two phrases when using them in the same positions as those in the original poem. </p>
<p>You can take up to two phrases and three to four letters when using them in different positions as those in the original poem. </p>
<p>Except famous poets' poems that are evaluated as excellent, it is allowed to use the first two phrases including Makura word (Poetic epithet convention) or <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Jokotoba (a preface word).html">jokotoba</a> (a preface word) of the original. </p>
<p>The main theme should be different from that of the original. </p>
<p>The original should be taken from Sandaishu (three major collections of Japanese poetry; Collection of Ancient and Modern Japanese Poetry, Later Collection of Japanese Poetry and Collection of Japanese poetry compiled by imperial command), "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Ise Monogatari.html">Ise Monogatari</a>" (The Tales of Ise), or "Sanjurokunin <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kashu.html">kashu</a>" (Thirty-Six Anthologies), not from recent poetry (from the view <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Point (Sentoki).html">point</a> of Teika). </p>
