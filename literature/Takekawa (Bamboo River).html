<h1>Takekawa (Bamboo River) (竹河)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Takekawa is a chapter title of "Genji <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Monogatari.html">Monogatari</a> "(<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/The Tale of Genji.html">The Tale of Genji</a>) which has fifty four chapters. It is the forty-fourth chapter. It describes a struggle of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Tamakazura (The Tale of Genji).html">Tamakazura</a>, Kita no kata (the woman living in the north of the house; wife) of Higekuro <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Daijo-daijin (Grand minister of state).html">Daijo-daijin</a> (Grand minister of state), after his death. </p>
<p>Plot summary<br/>
It is the story of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Kaoru.html">Kaoru</a>'s life between the ages of fourteen and twenty three. </p>
<p>After Higekuro <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Daijo-daijin (Grand minister of state).html">Daijo-daijin</a> passed away, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Tamakazura (The Tale of Genji).html">Tamakazura</a> was left with her three sons and two daughters, and tried to restore her ruined family. <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Kinjo no Mikado.html">Kinjo no Mikado</a> and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Emperor Reizei.html">Emperor Reizei</a> asked <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Tamakazura (The Tale of Genji).html">Tamakazura</a> to let them marry her two daughters, Oigimi (oldest sister) and Naka no Kimi, but Mikado had already been married to young lady <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Akashi (The Tale of Genji).html">Akashi</a>, her sister-in-law, and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Emperor Reizei.html">Emperor Reizei</a> had Kokiden no <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Nyogo (rank of court lady).html">nyogo</a> (Empress Kokiden), her older sister by a different mother, so she did not know what to do. <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Kaoru.html">Kaoru</a> and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Kurodo (Chamberlain).html">Kurodo</a> no Shosho (Chamberlain Lieutenant) who was <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Yugiri (The Tale of Genji).html">Yugiri</a> (Evening Mist)'s fifth son were also Oigimi's suitors. </p>
<p>In late January when <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Kaoru.html">Kaoru</a> was fifteen, young people gathered at <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Tamakazura (The Tale of Genji).html">Tamakazura</a>'s residence to sing "Takekawa" in the Saibara style (a genre of Heian-period Japanese court music (primarily consisting of gagaku-styled folk melodies)). At that time, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Tamakazura (The Tale of Genji).html">Tamakazura</a> realized that the sound of wagon (Japanese harp) which <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Kaoru.html">Kaoru</a> was playing was similar to that by her deceased father, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Tono Chujo (a government post).html">Tono Chujo</a> (the first secretary's captain), and her deceased older brother, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Kashiwagi (The Tale of Genji).html">Kashiwagi</a> (The Oak Tree). </p>
<p>At dusk in March, when the cherry blossoms were in full bloom, two himegimi opened the bamboo blind and played a game of Go for the cherry blossom tree. <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Kurodo (Chamberlain).html">Kurodo</a> no Shosho saw this and felt his feelings for Oigimi deepen. </p>
<p><a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Tamakazura (The Tale of Genji).html">Tamakazura</a> decided to make Oigimi marry <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Emperor Reizei.html">Emperor Reizei</a>. 
<br/>When Shosho knew this, he was so disappointed that he appealed to his mother, Kumoi no Kari,<br/>
Kumoi no Kari sent a letter of protest to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Tamakazura (The Tale of Genji).html">Tamakazura</a>, so she was unsure what to do. Oigimi entered the imperial palace in April and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Emperor Reizei.html">Emperor Reizei</a> felt great affection towards her. On the other hand, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Kinjo no Mikado.html">Kinjo no Mikado</a> was in a bad mood because his wish was not accepted, so her sons blamed <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Tamakazura (The Tale of Genji).html">Tamakazura</a>. </p>
<p>In April of the following year, Oigimi gave birth to an onna miya (Japanese imperial princess). <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Tamakazura (The Tale of Genji).html">Tamakazura</a> handed over her position of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Naishi no tsukasa.html">Naishi no tsukasa</a> (female palace attendant) to Naka no Kimi, marrying her to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Kinjo no Mikado.html">Kinjo no Mikado</a>. </p>
<p>Even after that, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Emperor Reizei.html">Emperor Reizei</a>'s affection didn't fade and Oigimi gave birth to an imperial prince a few years later. <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Emperor Reizei.html">Emperor Reizei</a> was greatly pleased, but Oigimi came to go back home frequently due to mental exhaustion because those around her were jealous. Meanwhile, Naka no Kimi lived in comfort with <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Kinjo no Mikado.html">Kinjo no Mikado</a>. </p>
<p>A few years later, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Kaoru.html">Kaoru</a> and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Kurodo (Chamberlain).html">Kurodo</a> no Shosho were steadily promoted to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Chunagon.html">Chunagon</a> (vice-councilor of state) and Saisho no Chujo (Consultant Captain) respectively. Every time when <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Tamakazura (The Tale of Genji).html">Tamakazura</a> thought of unhappiness of Oigimi and compared <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Kaoru.html">Kaoru</a> and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Kurodo (Chamberlain).html">Kurodo</a> no Shosho with her sons whose promotions were slow, she was bitterly disappointed by this frustrating world and could not help feeling regret. </p>
<p>Theory about the additional chapter/ Theory about the authorship<br/>
In this chapter, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Kaoru.html">Kaoru</a> was promoted to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Chunagon.html">Chunagon</a> (vice-councilor of state), and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Kobai (The Rose Plum) (The Tale of Genji).html">Kobai</a> (the rose plum) and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Yugiri (The Tale of Genji).html">Yugiri</a> were also promoted from <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Dainagon (chief councilor of state).html">Dainagon</a> (chief councilor of state) to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Udaijin (Minister of the Right).html">Udaijin</a> (minister of the right), and from <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Udaijin (Minister of the Right).html">Udaijin</a> to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Sadaijin (Minister of the Left).html">Sadaijin</a> (minister of the left) respectively. Nevertheless, in the following chapters, there are inconsistent descriptions of official titles, for example, some characters are called by their old titles. In addition, of the 54 chapters, this is the only chapter in which the narrator shows its position; for these reasons, some people claimed that the chapter was written in later years or by a different author. </p>
<p>However, some people deny these theories about the additional chapter and the different author, stating that these problems can be explained as a matter of structure. </p>
