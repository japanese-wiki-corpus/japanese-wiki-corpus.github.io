<h1>Gonki (権記)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>"Gonki" is a diary of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Yukinari.html">FUJIWARA no Yukinari</a>, who lived during the middle of the Heian period. The diary is also called Yukinarigyoki and Gondainagonki. Gonki was written when <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Michinaga.html">FUJIWARA no Michinaga</a> was at the height of his prosperity and is an important historical document that describes the conditions of the Imperial Court of the time. </p>
<p>The diary, which is missing a number of writings, reveals events running from 991 to 1017. The actual diary written by Yukinari does not exist anymore. The oldest reprint is one that was copied before the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period and is owned by the Archives and Mausolea Department of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Imperial Household Agency.html">Imperial Household Agency</a>.
