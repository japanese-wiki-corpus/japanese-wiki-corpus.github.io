<h1>Ochiba no miya (落葉の宮)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Ochiba no miya is a fictitious character in "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/The Tale of Genji.html">The Tale of Genji</a>." </p>
<p>She is the second princess (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Onna Ninomiya.html">Onna Ninomiya</a>) of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Emperor Suzaku.html">Emperor Suzaku</a>, and her mother is Ichijo no Miyasudokoro, who was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Emperor Suzaku.html">Emperor Suzaku</a>'s koi (a lady in waiting in the court). <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Tono Chujo (a government post).html">Tono Chujo</a> felt pity for his son <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kashiwagi (The Tale of Genji).html">Kashiwagi</a>, who wanted to marry Onna Sannomiya, the younger sister of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Onna Ninomiya.html">Onna Ninomiya</a> by a different mother, so he pleaded with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Emperor Suzaku.html">Emperor Suzaku</a> to give his daughter in marriage to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kashiwagi (The Tale of Genji).html">Kashiwagi</a>. 
<br/>She left the Imperial family to become <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kashiwagi (The Tale of Genji).html">Kashiwagi</a>'s lawful wife. ('<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Wakana (new herbs) (The Tale of Genji).html">Wakana</a>' (Spring Shoots) vol.2)<br/>
However, her husband was still in love with Onna Sannomiya and ignored her. He made a poem in which he regarded her as a boring woman like a fallen leaf, comparing her with her younger sister, Onna Sannomiya (because of this, she was called 'Ochiba no miya' by the readers in the future). </p>
<p>After her husband, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kashiwagi (The Tale of Genji).html">Kashiwagi</a>, had a relationship with Onna Sannomiya, he died young. 
<br/>Subsequently, his best friend, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Yugiri (The Tale of Genji).html">Yugiri</a>, who was asked on <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kashiwagi (The Tale of Genji).html">Kashiwagi</a>'s deathbed to look after his family after he was gone, often visited her. ('<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kashiwagi (The Tale of Genji).html">Kashiwagi</a>' (The Oak Tree))<br/>
Before long, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Yugiri (The Tale of Genji).html">Yugiri</a> came to feel affection towards <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Onna Ninomiya.html">Onna Ninomiya</a>, who was quiet and graceful. After the death of her mother, she was almost forced to move from a mountain villa in Ono, where she lived in seclusion, to the principal residence of Ichijo no Miya, and then <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Yugiri (The Tale of Genji).html">Yugiri</a> proposed marriage to her. 
<br/>She refused him at first, but eventually she could not help marrying him.

</p>
<p>After <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Hikaru Genji.html">Hikaru Genji</a> passed away, she moved to northeast pavilion in Rokujo-in Palace, and adopted Roku no kimi, a daughter between <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Yugiri (The Tale of Genji).html">Yugiri</a> and his concubine, To no Naishinosuke. ('Nioumiya' (His Perfumed Highness))<br/>
In Uji jujo (The Ten Quires of Uji), Roku no kimi got married to Nioumiya, and Ochiba no miya and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Yugiri (The Tale of Genji).html">Yugiri</a> were lovingly together, living a relatively happy life.

</p>
<p>As stated before, the name of 'Ochiba no miya' was originally a disparaging name, so she is often called Onnna Ninomiya or <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Suzakuin.html">Suzakuin</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Onna Ninomiya.html">Onna Ninomiya</a> in order to distinguish her from the other <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Onna Ninomiya.html">Onna Ninomiya</a> (the second princess). </p>
