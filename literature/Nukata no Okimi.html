<h1>Nukata no <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Okimi (great king) (Yamato sovereignty).html">Okimi</a> (額田王)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Nukata no <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Okimi (great king) (Yamato sovereignty).html">Okimi</a> (also known as Nukata no Kimi) (dates of birth and death unknown) was a leading female Japanese poet who was active during the reigns of the emperors Kogyoku and Jito with poems in the "<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Manyoshu (Collection of Ten Thousand Leaves).html">Manyoshu</a>" (Collection of Ten-Thousand Leaves). She was a wife of Emperor Tenmu (according to some accounts, she was an <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Uneme.html">uneme</a>, a woman from a provincial official or notable family sent to court as a maid-in-waiting). Her name is usually written as 額田王 (as described in "<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Manyoshu (Collection of Ten Thousand Leaves).html">Manyoshu</a>"), while 額田姫王 (as described in "Nihon Shoki" (Chronicles of Japan)) and 額田部姫王 (as described in "Yakushiji Engi" (The History of The <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Yakushi-ji Temple.html">Yakushi-ji Temple</a>)) are also used. </p>
<p><h3>Relatives, etc.</h3>
</p>
<p>According to "Nihon Shoki," Nukata no <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Okimi (great king) (Yamato sovereignty).html">Okimi</a> was a daughter of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Kagami no Okimi.html">Kagami no Okimi</a> who married Oama no miko (Prince Oama, later Emperor Tenmu) and gave birth to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Tochi no Himemiko (also pronounced Toichi no Himemiko).html">Tochi no Himemiko</a> (also pronounced Toichi; Princess Tochi). <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Kagami no Okimi.html">Kagami no Okimi</a> may have been a member of the ozoku (kozoku (the Imperial Family) who are second- to the fifth-generation descendants of an emperor) judging by the title '王' (O, which was used by male descendants of emperors up to the fifth generation), although his name does not appear in any other historical source; moreover, according to one theory, he may have been a great-grandson of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Senka.html">Emperor Senka</a>. Another theory is that he may have been part of the powerful family that ruled Kagamisato, Yasu County in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Omi Province.html">Omi Province</a>, and died in the Jinshin War. </p>
<p>According to some theories, the birthplace of Nukata no <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Okimi (great king) (Yamato sovereignty).html">Okimi</a> may be traced back to the former Nukata no sato village, Hegurino-kori in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Yamato Province.html">Yamato Province</a> (the present-day Yamatokoriyama City, Nara Prefecture) or the eastern part of Shimane Prefecture (formerly Ou-no-kori in Izumo Province). </p>
<p>A theory (by <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Norinaga MOTOORI.html">Norinaga MOTOORI</a> in his essay "Tamakatsuma" (A Jeweled Basket)) states that <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Kagami no Okimi.html">Kagami no Okimi</a> (鏡王女), who appears in "<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Manyoshu (Collection of Ten Thousand Leaves).html">Manyoshu</a>" and "Nihon Shoki" may be an elder sister of Nukata no <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Okimi (great king) (Yamato sovereignty).html">Okimi</a>, assuming that '鏡王女' means '女 (daughter of) 鏡王(Kagami no O)', but this may be far-fetched. A new hypothesis derived from the same assumption states that '女 (daughter of) 鏡王' might actually have been Nukata no <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Okimi (great king) (Yamato sovereignty).html">Okimi</a> herself. </p>
<p>The story that after she gave birth to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Tochi no Himemiko (also pronounced Toichi no Himemiko).html">Tochi no Himemiko</a>, Nukata no <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Okimi (great king) (Yamato sovereignty).html">Okimi</a> was loved by Nakano Oe no Oji (also pronounced Nakano Oe no Miko; Prince Nakano Oe, later <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Tenchi (Tenji).html">Emperor Tenchi</a>), who was the elder brother of Emperor Tenmu, is widely believed but there is no proof. The only circumstantial evidence consisted of the poems in "<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Manyoshu (Collection of Ten Thousand Leaves).html">Manyoshu</a>." The following two poems are generally read with the assumption that Nukata no <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Okimi (great king) (Yamato sovereignty).html">Okimi</a> was involved in a love triangle with <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Tenchi (Tenji).html">Emperor Tenchi</a> and Emperor Tenmu. </p>
<p>As you ride back and forth through the fields of gromwell plants, As you ride back and forth through the Imperial hunting fields marked off with sacred ropes, will not the field-watchers have seen your waving of the sleeves at me? (Vol. 1: 20, composed by Nukata no <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Okimi (great king) (Yamato sovereignty).html">Okimi</a>)<br/>
If I did not care for you, beautiful as the gromwell flower, would I still love you, even though you are another's wife? (Vol. 1: 21, composed by Oama no miko)<br/>
On the contrary, because Yasaburo IKEDA and Kenkichi YAMAMOTO wrote in "Manyo Hyakka" (A Hundred Poems from the Manyo-shu) that these two poems might have been composed for entertainment during a banquet, their view has been accepted as the common view among academics. Among her late poems, Nukata no <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Okimi (great king) (Yamato sovereignty).html">Okimi</a> had Zotoka (poetry exchanged between a man and a woman) with Yuge no miko (Prince Yuge) when the Prince accompanied <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Empress Jito.html">Empress Jito</a> to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Yoshino.html">Yoshino</a>; judging by the period of the imperial visit, Nukata no <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Okimi (great king) (Yamato sovereignty).html">Okimi</a> would certainly have lived into her sixties. </p>
<p>Itsuko OKABE, Takeshi UMEHARA and others presented a new view that an inscription '比売朝臣額田' found in '<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/National Treasures (of Japan).html">National Treasures</a> of Tanzan-jinja' (National Treasure) owned by Tanzan-jinja shrine may be the new name for Nukata no <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Okimi (great king) (Yamato sovereignty).html">Okimi</a> after descending to the status of a subject. Although the truth remains unknown due to the lack of historical sources, it was somewhat doubtful that Nukata no <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Okimi (great king) (Yamato sovereignty).html">Okimi</a>, who was a member of ozoku was granted the title Ason (also pronounced <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Asomi.html">Asomi</a>, granted to powerful families descended from the Imperial Family). If this was the case, Nukata no <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Okimi (great king) (Yamato sovereignty).html">Okimi</a> remarried NAKATOMI no Oshima, who was a leading member of the Fujiwara clan of those days, and lived to be nearly 80 years old. <h3>Anecdotes</h3>
</p>
<p>It is a commonly accepted view in novels that Nukata no <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Okimi (great king) (Yamato sovereignty).html">Okimi</a> was a woman of unmatched beauty. However, there are few remaining historical sources about Nukata no <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Okimi (great king) (Yamato sovereignty).html">Okimi</a> and none regarding her appearance. According to Nobuyuki Kajikawa (in his "Tsukurareta Manyo no <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Kajin (Waka or Tanka Poets).html">Kajin</a>: Nukada no <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Okimi (great king) (Yamato sovereignty).html">Okimi</a>" (Fabricated Manyo Poet: Nukada no <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Okimi (great king) (Yamato sovereignty).html">Okimi</a>)), "Kogane Isago" (A Commentary on <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Manyoshu (Collection of Ten Thousand Leaves).html">Manyoshu</a>), written by <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Akinari UEDA.html">Akinari UEDA</a>, was one of the earliest examples in which a description of Nukata no <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Okimi (great king) (Yamato sovereignty).html">Okimi</a>'s appearance was given. Descriptions of her appearance were added based on the above poems which suggest a love triangle. Some of the earliest descriptions of the love triangle were made in the Edo period by people such as Mitsue FUJITANI (in his "<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Manyoshu (Collection of Ten Thousand Leaves).html">Manyoshu</a> tomoshibi" (Light on <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Manyoshu (Collection of Ten Thousand Leaves).html">Manyoshu</a>)) and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Nobutomo BAN.html">Nobutomo BAN</a> (in his "Nagara no Yamakaze" (The Mountain Wind of Nagara)). In any case, 'legends' are so deeply rooted that, according to Kajikawa, his remarks that Nukata no <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Okimi (great king) (Yamato sovereignty).html">Okimi</a>'s beauty was groundless once made his audiences turn on him. Haku ITO (scholar of Manyo) had a similar anecdote that a woman asked him to withdraw the remarks he had made in his lecture, which was also that there was no proof regarding the generally accepted impression of Nukata no <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Okimi (great king) (Yamato sovereignty).html">Okimi</a> ("Manyo no <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Kajin (Waka or Tanka Poets).html">Kajin</a> to Sakuhin" (Poets and their Works in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Manyoshu (Collection of Ten Thousand Leaves).html">Manyoshu</a>)). Akira FUJIEDA had a similar anecdote concerning his lecture on Prince Shotoku (Seiichi OYAMA "'<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Shotoku Taishi (Prince Shotoku).html">Shotoku Taishi</a>' no tanjo" (The Birth of '<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Shotoku Taishi (Prince Shotoku).html">Shotoku Taishi</a>')). The above-mentioned cases are examples of the large gap between what is understood regarding a historical figure from historical sources and what is generally thought about the figure. </p>
