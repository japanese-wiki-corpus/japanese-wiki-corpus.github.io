<h1>Hotaru (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/The Tale of Genji.html">The Tale of Genji</a>) (蛍 (源氏物語))</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Hotaru (The Fireflies) is one of the 54 chapters of "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/The Tale of Genji.html">The Tale of Genji</a>." It is the 25th chapter. </p>
<p>Summary<br/>
The chapter concerns the month of May when <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Hikaru Genji.html">Hikaru Genji</a> was 36. </p>
<p>Around the time of the early summer rains, a letter arrived for <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Tamakazura (The Tale of Genji).html">Tamakazura</a> from Hotaru Hyobukyonomiya, so Genji had her write a reply. Genji released fireflies behind the screen separating Hyobukyonomiya, who had arrived at the Rokujo-in Palace in high spirits, and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Tamakazura (The Tale of Genji).html">Tamakazura</a>, softly illuminating her silhouette. Hyobukyonomiya was deeply attracted to her beauty, which was greater than he had expected, so he sent a waka poem to express his love to her, but she just ignored him. (Due to this episode, Hyobukyonomiya came to be called Hotaru no miya or Hotaru Hyobukyonomiya). </p>
<p>At a festival on the fifth day of the fifth month, many decorative paper balls were sent to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Tamakazura (The Tale of Genji).html">Tamakazura</a>. Genji held horseback archery events and banquets at the Natsu no Machi section of the palace and spent the night at <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Hanachirusato.html">Hanachirusato</a>'s. Before long, the rainy season arrived, and Genji spent time giving critiques of the tales that <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Tamakazura (The Tale of Genji).html">Tamakazura</a> was absorbed in, and bothering her with his unending wooing. Around that time, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Tamakazura (The Tale of Genji).html">Tamakazura</a>'s real father, To no Chujo, was told by a dream diviner that his daughter by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Yugao (The Tale of Genji).html">Yugao</a> had been adopted by someone else. Never imagining that she lived with Genji, he set out to look for her. </p>
