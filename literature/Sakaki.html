<h1>Sakaki (賢木)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Sakaki (The Green Branch) is one of the fifty-four chapters of "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/The Tale of Genji.html">The Tale of Genji</a>." It is the 10th chapter. The title comes from the waka poems that <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Hikaru Genji.html">Hikaru Genji</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Rokujo no Miyasudokoro.html">Rokujo no Miyasudokoro</a> exchanged in the chapter.

<p>Soon after the high priestess had left, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Emperor Kiritsubo.html">Emperor Kiritsubo</a> fell into a critical condition, and died. Genji's feelings for <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Fujitsubo.html">Fujitsubo</a>, who had returned to her family's place, become harder and harder to bear, and he stealthily visits her though he is strongly rejected. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Fujitsubo.html">Fujitsubo</a>, afraid that their affairs would be laid bare and that it would plunge <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Emperor Reizei.html">Emperor Reizei</a> into a crisis, suddenly becomes a Buddhist nun after the first year's anniversary of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Emperor Kiritsubo.html">Emperor Kiritsubo</a>'s death, without telling either Genji or any other member of her family about it.
