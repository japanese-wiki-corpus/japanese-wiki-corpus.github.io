<p></p>
<p>Lady Kokiden is the name for fictitious empresses in stories whose real names were unknown. Famous examples are two women in "<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/The Tale of Genji.html">The Tale of Genji</a>." </p>
<p>1. The wife of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Emperor Kiritsubo.html">Emperor Kiritsubo</a> and the mother of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Emperor Suzaku.html">Emperor Suzaku</a>. She will be described below. </p>
<p>2. The wife of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Emperor Reizei.html">Emperor Reizei</a>. She was the eldest daughter of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Naidaijin (inner minister).html">Naidaijin</a> (To no Chujo) and her mother was the fourth princess of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Udaijin (Minister of the Right).html">Udaijin</a> (the Minister of the Right) at the time of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Emperor Kiritsubo.html">Emperor Kiritsubo</a>. She was a niece of 1. Lady Kokiden is a fictitious person in "<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/The Tale of Genji.html">The Tale of Genji</a>" written by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Murasaki Shikibu.html">Murasaki Shikibu</a>. She was later called the Empress Kokiden. </p>
<p>She was a daughter (probably the eldest) of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Udaijin (Minister of the Right).html">Udaijin</a> at the time of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Emperor Kiritsubo.html">Emperor Kiritsubo</a>, and was the first empress married to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Kiritsubo.html">Kiritsubo</a> when he was still the crown prince. She had the first prince (crown prince, later the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Emperor Suzaku.html">Emperor Suzaku</a>) and two princesses (Ippon no Miya and Sai-in). She lived in the Kokiden of the highest prestige among the empresses' residences and exerted power, but <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Kiritsubo no Koi.html">Kiritsubo no Koi</a> (lower class court lady) took away the love of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Emperor Kiritsubo.html">Emperor Kiritsubo</a> from her, and that was why she detested <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Hikaru Genji.html">Hikaru Genji</a>, the son of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Kiritsubo no Koi.html">Kiritsubo no Koi</a>, even after his mother died. She was particularly outraged by Genji's relation with Aoi no ue (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Lady Aoi.html">Lady Aoi</a>) and her younger sister <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Oborozukiyo (The Tale of Genji).html">Oborozukiyo</a> (the misty moon), because she hoped to make both of them to be empresses of the crown prince. Therefore, she vehemently rejected <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Udaijin (Minister of the Right).html">Udaijin</a>'s plan to marry <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Oborozukiyo (The Tale of Genji).html">Oborozukiyo</a> to Genji after the death of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Lady Aoi.html">Lady Aoi</a>. </p>
<p>She also had strong hostility toward <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Fujitsubo.html">Fujitsubo</a> who was the very image of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Kiritsubo.html">Kiritsubo</a> no koi, because Genji became attached to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Fujitsubo.html">Fujitsubo</a>. Later, when <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Fujitsubo.html">Fujitsubo</a> gave birth to a prince (later the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Emperor Reizei.html">Emperor Reizei</a> who was actually Genji's son) and became <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Chugu.html">Chugu</a> (the Empress), Lady Kokiden was very upset because she was supposed to be <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Chugu.html">Chugu</a> as the birth mother of the next emperor (chapter '<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Momiji no Ga.html">Momiji no Ga</a>' (The Autumn Excursion)). </p>
<p>She became the Empress Dowager when the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Emperor Suzaku.html">Emperor Suzaku</a> ascended the throne (hereafter she was called the Empress Kokiden). After that, when Genji's affair with <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Oborozukiyo (The Tale of Genji).html">Oborozukiyo</a> who was <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Naishi no tsukasa.html">Naishi no tsukasa</a> (female palace attendant) was revealed, the Empress Kokiden succeeded in ruining Genji and exiling him to Suma; when her father <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daijo-daijin (Grand minister of state).html">Daijo-daijin</a> (Grand Minister and ex-Minister of the Right) died and her own health deteriorated due to illness, however, she couldn't stop the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Emperor Suzaku.html">Emperor Suzaku</a> from pardoning Genji. In chapter '<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Otome (The Tale of Genji).html">Otome</a>' (Maidens) it is described that when Genji and the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Emperor Reizei.html">Emperor Reizei</a> visited her, she regretted her cruel treatment of them but still she acted willfully again and again that bothered the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Suzakuin.html">Suzakuin</a> (the name of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Emperor Suzaku.html">Emperor Suzaku</a> after retirement). She was referred to only by name in the chapter '<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Hatsune (The Tale of Genji).html">Hatsune</a>' (First Warbler) for the last time and in the chapter 7Wakana: Jo' (New Herbs, Part I) it was told that she had already been dead. </p>
<p>Lady Kokiden came from a powerful family and was so fierce that the mother of Fujitsubo <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Chugu.html">Chugu</a> was afraid of the request from the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Emperor Kiritsubo.html">Emperor Kiritsubo</a> to send her daughter into the court, but it was a proof of her dignified presence. Particularly after she became the Empress Dowager, she exerted absolute power as the mother of the emperor. She tends to be regarded as a villain who tortured Genji the most among his political opponents, but she is also a typical character to depict the empress's residence and Sekkan-ke, the families which produced the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Regent.html">Regent</a> and the Chief Adviser to the Emperor, at the time of the story. </p>
<p>It is said that a model of Lady Kokiden is modeled on <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/FUJIWARA no Onshi.html">FUJIWARA no Onshi</a> who was the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Daigo.html">Emperor Daigo</a>'s Empress, because the life of Lady Kokiden resembled her life. </p>
