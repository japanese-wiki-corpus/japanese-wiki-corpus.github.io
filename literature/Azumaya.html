<h1>Azumaya (東屋)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Azumaya is one of the fifty-four chapters of "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/The Tale of Genji.html">The Tale of Genji</a>." It is the 50th chapter. This is the sixth chapter of 'Uji jujo' (The Ten Quires of Uji), a part of the tale's third section. </p>
<p>The title of this chapter was derived from the waka poetry which <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kaoru.html">Kaoru</a> composed when he visited <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Ukifune (The Tale of Genji).html">Ukifune</a>'s refuge. This poem implies that because trailing plants grow so thickly that they obstruct the entrance to Azumaya (small arbor), I have to wait too long outside in the rain ('Azumaya' originally refers to a simple house in Azuma no kuni, but recently it refers to a small arbor built in a garden or a park). 
<br/>Summary<br/>
This is a story about 26-year-old <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kaoru.html">Kaoru</a> from August to September. Although <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kaoru.html">Kaoru</a> cared about <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Ukifune (The Tale of Genji).html">Ukifune</a>, he hesitated because she was a stepdaughter of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Zuryo (The Head of The Provincial Governors).html">zuryo</a> (provincial governor). The mother of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Ukifune (The Tale of Genji).html">Ukifune</a> (Chujo no kimi) was also passive about this morganatic marriage. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Ukifune (The Tale of Genji).html">Ukifune</a> was born to Uji Hachi no miya and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Nyobo (a court lady).html">Nyobo</a> (a lady of the imperial court, a court lady) called Chujo no kimi. It was not long before Chujo no kimi got remarried to Mutsu no kami (deputy minister of regional administration in Mutsu) (later Hitachi no suke (Assistant Governor of Hitachi Province)), and together with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Ukifune (The Tale of Genji).html">Ukifune</a> they lived in eastern part of Japan for a long time. They had a lot of children, but especially nursed the most beautiful child <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Ukifune (The Tale of Genji).html">Ukifune</a> and eagerly wished her a good marriage. Many suitors for <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Ukifune (The Tale of Genji).html">Ukifune</a>'s hand came to Hitachi no suke because he was rich and of good birth for his rank, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Zuryo (The Head of The Provincial Governors).html">zuryo</a>. Soon after reaching the age of 20, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Ukifune (The Tale of Genji).html">Ukifune</a> got engaged to Sakon no shosho (deputy minister of the institution for guarding the Emperor). But Sakon no shosho was a fortune hunter, and as soon as he knew <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Ukifune (The Tale of Genji).html">Ukifune</a> was not Hitachi no suke's biological daughter, he turned to her younger sister who was Hitachi no suke's biological daughter and married her. </p>
<p>Feeling sorry for <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Ukifune (The Tale of Genji).html">Ukifune</a>, Chujo no kimi was going to place her under the care of Naka no kimi in Nijoin. Nevertheless, Nioumiya incidentally found <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Ukifune (The Tale of Genji).html">Ukifune</a>'s whereabouts and forcibly made approaches to her. </p>
<p>Although hardly anything ever happened between them, Chujo no kimi was surprised to hear that and hid <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Ukifune (The Tale of Genji).html">Ukifune</a> in a small house at Sanjo. In autumn, September, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kaoru.html">Kaoru</a> found again <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Ukifune (The Tale of Genji).html">Ukifune</a>'s whereabouts, and through the mediation of Ben no ama, he visited her. The next morning, he took her on a cow carriage and went to Uji together. Despite her anxiety, he saw the late <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Okimi (great king) (Yamato sovereignty).html">Okimi</a> in her and cherished the memory of Oikimi. But he was worried about his future relationship with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Ukifune (The Tale of Genji).html">Ukifune</a>. </p>
