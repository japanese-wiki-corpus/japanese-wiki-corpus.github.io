<h1>Nise Murasaki Inaka Genji (偐紫田舎源氏)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>"Nise Murasaki Inaka Genji" (<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/The Tale of Genji.html">The Tale of Genji</a> during the Muromachi period) is an unfinished long gokan (bound-together volumes of illustrated books) written by Tanehiko RYUTEI. The illustrator was <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Kunisada UTAGAWA.html">Kunisada UTAGAWA</a>. It was published from 1829 to 1842. The books were tremendously successful, but the series were finished with the 38th book due to official sanctions arising from the publication of the work and the author's death. However, the unpublished manuscripts of the 39th and the 40th books were put published in 1928. </p>
<p>Summary<br/>
It is based on <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Murasaki Shikibu.html">Murasaki Shikibu</a>'s "<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/The Tale of Genji.html">The Tale of Genji</a>," and the setting changed from the Heian period to the Muromachi period. </p>
<p>In order to stifle <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Sozen YAMANA.html">Sozen YAMANA</a>, who was trying to attain the position of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a>, Mitsuuji, an illegitimate child of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Yoshimasa ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshimasa ASHIKAGA</a>, gradually got back the treasures of Ashikaga clan that Sozen stole and hid, pretending to be a man with a rich love life like <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Hikaru Genji.html">Hikaru Genji</a>. Meanwhile, he lived a roaming life at Suma <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Akashi (The Tale of Genji).html">Akashi</a>, containing the Yamana's army of Saigoku (western part of Japan [esp. Kyushu, but ranging as far east as Kinki]), and destroying Sozen and his followers by stratagem, then returned to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> to become <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a>'s guardian, being at the height of his prosperity. </p>
<p>Details<br/>
Writing the gokan series such as "Shohon-jitate" (Stories in a Promptbook Form), Tanehiko RYUTEI had already been a popular writer, while his senior, Bakin KYOKUTEI was popular for writing long gokan such as "Konpira-bune risho no tomozuna" (Life Lines of Grace from <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Konpira.html">Konpira</a>'s Boat), "Keisei Suikoden" (A Courtesans' Shui hu chuan), and so on. These books are respectively adapted from "Hsi-yu chi" (Journey to the West) and "Shui-hu chuan" (The Water Margin). Bakin was familiar with Chinese novels, while Tanehiko was a master of the Japanese classics. It is said that he wrote the adaptation from <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/The Tale of Genji.html">The Tale of Genji</a> in order to compete with Bakin. </p>
<p>The word "Murasaki" in "Nise Murasaki" refers to both <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Murasaki Shikibu.html">Murasaki Shikibu</a> and gromwell, the high-grade dye. </p>
<p>The publisher was Kiemon TSURUYA of the Senkakudo Publishing House at Tori Abura-cho (the present Odenma-cho, Nihonbashi, Chuo Ward (Tokyo)). Each page was printed on the right and left of a half sheet of Japanese paper, and the printed paper was folded in half, bound ten sheets to one book which consisted of 20 pages. Two volumes were placed into an envelope, making one book. The size of the paper was close to B paper and the book was medium-sized. </p>
<p>At first the author and the publishing house did not intend to make an adaptation of all the 54 chapters of "Genji" and publish it, but the success of the series encouraged them and they published a few books every year as the following items suggest. However, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Tadakuni MIZUNO.html">Tadakuni MIZUNO</a> carried out Tenpo Reforms and he accused them falsely, saying 'these books revealed the real situation of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/O-oku.html">O-oku</a> (the inner halls of Edo-jo Castle where the wife of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> and her servants reside) in the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun family.html">Shogun family</a>,' so the publishing ended with the 38th book. Then the 39th and the 40th books were posthumously published as a part of "Inaka Genji" in 1928. </p>
<p>Each book was adapted from the chapters of "<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/The Tale of Genji.html">The Tale of Genji</a>" in right column. </p>

</p>
<p>In 1882, some woodblock books were published, but it is not clear whether all the books were published. Books bound in Western style have been repeatedly published since then till quite recently. </p>
<p>"Sonoyukari Hina no Omokage" (its fate the likeness of rustic youth), imitation of "Inaka Genji" was written by Tanehiko's disciples, Senka RYUTEI (books 1-6) and Tanekazu RYUKATEI (books 7-23) from 1847 to 1864. </p>
<p><a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Kabuki.html">Kabuki</a> (traditional drama performed by male actors) performances adapted from "Inaka Genji" were "Goshomoyo Genji no Edozome" performed at Ichimura-za Theater in March 1838, "Genjimoyo Furisode Hinagata" (Dress Patterns in Genji Style) performed at Ichimura-za Theater in September 1851, and "忠暮時雨袖旧寺" performed at Morita-za Theater in October 1867. A part of "Genjimoyo Furisode Hinagata" survives to this day under the name of "Inaka Genji Tsuyu no Shinonome" (Rustic Genji Daybreak Dew). </p>
<p>By the way, "Nise Murasaki Naniwa no Genji" (1837), a work which has a similar title and was written by Tanehiko, is a concealed pornographic book. </p>
