<h1>Koshikibu no <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Naishi.html">Naishi</a> (小式部内侍)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Koshikibu no <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Naishi.html">Naishi</a> (ca. 999-November, 1025) was a female poet who lived during the Heian period. She was <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Naishi.html">Naishi</a> no jo (a woman officer who carried the Emperor's sword when he went out). Her father was <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/TACHIBANA no Michisada.html">TACHIBANA no Michisada</a>, and her mother was <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Izumi Shikibu.html">Izumi Shikibu</a>. Together with her mother, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Izumi Shikibu.html">Izumi Shikibu</a>, she served <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/FUJIWARA no Shoshi.html">FUJIWARA no Shoshi</a>, the second consort of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Ichijo.html">Emperor Ichijo</a>. Therefore she came to be called 'Koshikibu' (literally little Shikibu) in order to be distinguished from her mother Shikibu. </p>
<p><h3>Career</h3>
</p>
<p>Just like her mother, she was known as a female poet who fell in love with many noble men such as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/FUJIWARA no Norimichi.html">FUJIWARA no Norimichi</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/FUJIWARA no Sadayori.html">FUJIWARA no Sadayori</a>, and FUJIWARA no Norinaga. She bore Norimichi Joen, and had a daughter between her and Norinaga. In 1025, when she gave birth to the child of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/FUJIWARA no Kinnari.html">FUJIWARA no Kinnari</a> (Yorishinobu <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Ajari.html">Ajari</a>, a master in esoteric Buddhism), she passed away in her twenties, and people around her mourned for her. The poem composed by her mother, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Izumi Shikibu.html">Izumi Shikibu</a>, upon her death is a well known masterpiece of elegy. </p>
<p>Anecdotes concerning Koshikibu no <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Naishi.html">Naishi</a> were collected in many collections of anecdotes such as; "Jikkinsho" (A Miscellany of Ten Maxims) and "Kokon Chomon ju" (A collection of Tales Heard, Past and Present). 
<br/>Most of the anecdotes are related to the love between her and Norimichi, or the following poem of '<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Mt. Oe.html">Mt. Oe</a>.'<br/>
"Mumyozoshi" (critique of tales) also contains descriptions about her, and she was praised as an ideal woman in the book. <h3>Poems composed by Koshikibu no <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Naishi.html">Naishi</a></h3>
</p>
<p>This poem was also collected in "<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Kinyo Wakashu (Kinyo Collection of Japanese Poems).html">Kinyo Wakashu</a>" (Kinyo Collection of Japanese Poems), but the word order of this poem ('fumi mo mada mizu') is different from the one collected in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Hyakunin Isshu.html">Hyakunin Isshu</a> (one hundred waka poems by one hundred poets). </p>
<p>This poem means that 'it takes many days to cross <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Mt. Oe.html">Mt. Oe</a> and go to Ikuno (a place-name in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Tango (the Boys Festival).html">Tango</a>), so I have never been to Amano <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Hashidate (a train).html">Hashidate</a>, where my mother lives, and I have not received a letter from her yet, either.'<br/>
When she was to present a poem, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Shijo.html">Shijo</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Chunagon.html">Chunagon</a> (vice-councilor of state - <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/FUJIWARA no Sadayori.html">FUJIWARA no Sadayori</a>) asked her maliciously 'if she had already sent a messenger to her mother in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Tango (the Boys Festival).html">Tango</a> (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Izumi Shikibu.html">Izumi Shikibu</a> lived in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Tango (the Boys Festival).html">Tango</a>, where her husband was working) in order to ask her to compose a poem instead, and if the messenger had already come back yet,' so it is said that she composed a poem on the spot. </p>
<p>In those days, there was a rumor that the poems by Koshikibu no <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Naishi.html">Naishi</a> were in fact composed by her mother, so <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Shijo.html">Shijo</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Chunagon.html">Chunagon</a> made fun of Koshikibu no <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Naishi.html">Naishi</a>, but she replied to him with an excellent poem. On the contrary, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Shijo.html">Shijo</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Chunagon.html">Chunagon</a>, who was so upset that he left without making a reply poem, disgraced himself in public, because it was against etiquette or custom in those days not to make a reply poem for the person who first composed a poem. </p>
<p>Her witty reply poem using plays on words such as 'ikuno' (literally a field to go, and Ikuno, the place-name) and 'fumi' (literally a letter, and to step) was set at a high value, and since then she had gained in her reputation as a poet. Fumi' is also Engo (associated word) with 'hashi' (a bridge) and 'michi' (a path). </p>
