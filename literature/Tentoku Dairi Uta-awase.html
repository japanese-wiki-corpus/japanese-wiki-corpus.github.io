<p>Tentoku <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Dairi (the Imperial palace).html">Dairi</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Uta-awase.html">Uta-awase</a> (Imperial Palace Poetry Contest in the Tentoku era) was a poetry contest hosted by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Murakami.html">Emperor Murakami</a> on May 3, 960. </p>
<p>Summary<br/>
There was a period of one month between the announcement of the poetic themes to the date of the contest. Meticulous preparations were made, from the procedures and costumes for both the right and the left side, to a suhama stand (decorative cove-shaped stand) on which were placed poetry cards made of Japanese paper. Such a graceful elegance of the Tentoku imperial poetry contest became a model for subsequent poetic contests. </p>
<p>Twelve themes for the contest were announced in late March: haze, nightingale, willow, cherry blossoms, kerria, wisteria, late spring, early summer, cuckoo (hototogisu), deutzia, summer grass, and love. The competition held contests for a total of twenty rounds, including two rounds each for the nightingale and cuckoo themes, three for cherry blossoms, and five for love. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/FUJIWARA no Saneyori.html">FUJIWARA no Saneyori</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Sadaijin (Minister of the Left).html">Sadaijin</a> (Minister of the Left), played the role of the judge (determining the winners and losers), assisted by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Takaakira.html">MINAMOTO no Takaakira</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Dainagon (chief councilor of state).html">Dainagon</a> (Chief Councilor of State). Koji (reciters of poems) were MINAMOTO no Nobumitsu for the left side and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Hiromasa.html">MINAMOTO no Hiromasa</a> for the right. Court ladies acting as supporters were divided to the left and right, each preparing elaborate costumes according to their base color, which was red (emperor red) for the left and blue (green) for the right. On the day of the contest, people began preparing the Seiryoden Summer Palace as the venue in the early afternoon. However, since the suhama stand for the left side came later, the contest did not begin before sunset. It continued throughout the night, ending with the victory of the left with 10 wins, 5 losses and 5 draws. After it was over, the participants enjoyed <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Kangen.html">kangen</a> (courtly <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Gagaku.html">gagaku</a> music) until finally leaving the palace the next morning. </p>

However hard I may try to hide it, my face cannot help but show that I am in love, so people continue to ask me about it. </p>
<p>Anecdotes<br/>
Hiromasa's mistake<br/>
In the third round of the nightingale theme, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Hiromasa.html">MINAMOTO no Hiromasa</a>, who was the reciter of the right side, mistakenly read the willow poem meant for the fourth round. Corrected by the supporters of the left, he was to read aloud the nightingale poem anew. He was so ashamed, however, that his face lost its color and with a trembling voice he was unable to recite properly. </p><p>Tadami's death in agony<br/>
In the 20th round, Saneyori, the judge, could not decide on a winner and suggested a draw. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/The Emperor (Tenno).html">The Emperor</a>, however, insisted that he should settle on a winner and loser. Saneyori asked his assistant, Takaakira, to decide, but the latter remained silent with his face toward the ground. Saneyori was at a loss at what to do, but as Takaakira heard the emperor mumbling, 'shinoburedo' which was a part of Kanemori's line, Takaakira conveyed this to Saneyori. Saneyori finally made up his mind and judged the right side as the winner. During this time the reciters of both sides kept reciting the poems. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/MIBU no Tadami.html">MIBU no Tadami</a>, who was a low-rank officer, was utterly disappointed that his poem that he had composed in hope of advancement in life was beaten in such a tight match. After the contest he developed anorexia and eventually died. </p>
