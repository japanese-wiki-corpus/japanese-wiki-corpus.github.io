<h1>Sawarabi (Early Ferns) (早蕨)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Sawarabi is one of the fifty-four chapters of "Genji <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Monogatari.html">Monogatari</a>" (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/The Tale of Genji.html">The Tale of Genji</a>). It is the forty-eighth chapter. It refers to the forth tale of 'Ujijujo' in the third section. 
<br/>The chapter title derives from the following verse by Naka no kimi: 'And to whom shall I show these early ferns from the mountain, plucked. In remembrance of one who is no more?'<br/>
</p>
<p>Summary<br/>
The story took place in the springtime when <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kaoru.html">Kaoru</a> was twenty-five years old. </p>
<p>The spring came again in the countryside of Uji city. Naka no kimi who had lost his father and sister received, as in the past, brackens and horsetails from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Ajari.html">Ajari</a> in Mt. Uji who used to be her father's religious master. She shed tears of gratitude for his kindness. </p>
<p>Nioumiya who found it difficult to go down to Uji invited her to Nijoin in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> in early February. Being her guardian, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kaoru.html">Kaoru</a> took care in preparing for her arrival in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. He went to Uji a day before her departure to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and both reminisced about <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Okimi (great king) (Yamato sovereignty).html">Okimi</a> until late at night. He deeply regretted that she had to stay with Nioumiya, missing her anew. Ben the Old Court Lady who had become a priestess after <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Okimi (great king) (Yamato sovereignty).html">Okimi</a>'s demise decided to remain in Uji. </p>
<p>Arriving at Nijoin on February 7 (old lunar calendar), Naka no kimi was given a warm reception by Nioumiya. Knowing this, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Yugiri (The Tale of Genji).html">Yugiri</a> (in the Tale of Genji) who had sought to arrange a marriage between Roku no kimi and Nioumiya forced Roku no kimi to undergo the ritual of mogi after February 20. She then asked <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kaoru.html">Kaoru</a> about this match, in which he took no interest. </p>
<p><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kaoru.html">Kaoru</a> went to Nijoin to have a conversation with Naka no kimi while the cherry blossoms were in full bloom. Nioumiya was suspicious of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kaoru.html">Kaoru</a> who was getting closer to Naka no miya. </p>
