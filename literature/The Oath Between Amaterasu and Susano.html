<p>Both the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Kojiki (The Records of Ancient Matters).html">Kojiki</a> (Records of Ancient Matters) and the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan).html">Nihonshoki</a> (Chronicles of Japan) give an account of an Ukei (an oath) between Amaterasu and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Susano.html">Susano</a>, and of the gods who came into being due to it. </p>
<p>Summary<br/>
The <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Kojiki (The Records of Ancient Matters).html">Kojiki</a><br/>
When his father <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Izanagi.html">Izanagi</a> told <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Susano.html">Susano</a> to rule the ocean, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Susano.html">Susano</a> cried and whined, saying that he wanted to go to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Nenokuni (Land of the Roots).html">Nenokuni</a> (or Yomi, the land of the dead) where his mother <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Izanami.html">Izanami</a> was, and caused tremendous damage to heaven and earth. 
<br/><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Izanagi.html">Izanagi</a> got angry about it, and sent <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Susano.html">Susano</a> into exile, proclaiming, 'Then, you shall not live in this country.'<br/>
</p>
<p><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Susano.html">Susano</a> thought that he would go to the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Nenokuni (Land of the Roots).html">Nenokuni</a> after he told his sister <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Amaterasu Omikami.html">Amaterasu Omikami</a> (the Sun Goddess), and ascended to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Takamanohara (plain of high heaven).html">Takamanohara</a> (the plain of high heaven) where she ruled. Amaterasu thought that <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Susano.html">Susano</a> had come to usurp <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Takamanohara (plain of high heaven).html">Takamanohara</a>, and met <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Susano.html">Susano</a> with a bow and arrow in her hands. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Susano.html">Susano</a> suggested to Amaterasu that they swear an Ukei (written as 宇気比 or 誓約 in Chinese characters) to dispel her doubt. The two gods swore the oath, being on opposite sides of Ame no Yasu-kawa River (the tranquil river of Heaven). First, Amaterasu received the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Totsuka no Tsurugi (a sword in the Japanese Myth).html">Totsuka no Tsurugi</a> (literally "the ten-hands-long sword") that <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Susano.html">Susano</a> had, and she crunched it down. The following three female gods (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Munakata Sanjojin.html">Munakata Sanjojin</a> [three goddesses enshrined in Munakata Taisha Shrine]) came into being from the misty spray that she blew out. People in Munakata believe in these female gods who have been enshrined in the Munakata-taisha Shrine. </p>
<p>Takiri bime no mikoto:<br/>
Also known as Okitsushima hime no mikoto. She has been enshrined in the Okitsu-miya. </p>
<p>Ichikishima hime no mikoto:<br/>
Also known as Sayori bime no mikoto. She has been enshrined in the Nakatsu-miya. </p>
<p>Takitsu hime no mikoto:<br/>
She has been enshrined in the Hetsu-miya. </p>
<p>Next, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Susano.html">Susano</a> received the '500 beads of the necklace with Yasakani no <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Magatama.html">magatama</a> (comma-shaped beads),' that Amaterasu had, and crunched it down. 
<br/>The following five male gods came into being from the misty breath he sprayed out:<br/>
</p>
<p>Masakatsuakatsu kachihayahi ame no oshihomimi no mikoto was born from the beads wrapped around her left mizura (hair-bunch). <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Amenohohi.html">Amenohohi</a> no mikoto was born from the beads wrapped around her right mizura. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Amatsuhikone.html">Amatsuhikone</a> no mikoto was born from the beads wrapped around her kazura (wig). Ikutsuhikome no mikoto was born from the beads wrapped around her left arm. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Kumanokusubi.html">Kumanokusubi</a> no mikoto was born from the beads wrapped around her right arm. </p>
<p>Amaterasu announced that she would take the later male gods to bring them up as her own offspring because they were born from her possession, and that the former female gods were <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Susano.html">Susano</a>'s offspring because they were born from his possession. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Susano.html">Susano</a> said that his children were the goddesses of graceful nature because his heart was guiltless, and Amaterasu pardoned <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Susano.html">Susano</a>. </p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan).html">Nihonshoki</a> (Chronicles of Japan)<br/>
In the text of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan).html">Nihonshoki</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Susano.html">Susano</a> bore five male gods and proved that he did not have any evil intentions. </p>
<p>In the arufumi (alternate writing) of the first and the third volumes, the two gods agreed that the one whose offspring were male would win, and produced children without exchanging things. That is to say, this story develops as follows: Amaterasu gave birth of female gods from the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Totsuka no Tsurugi (a sword in the Japanese Myth).html">Totsuka no Tsurugi</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Susano.html">Susano</a> bore male gods using his own <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Magatama.html">magatama</a> (comma-shaped beads), then <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Susano.html">Susano</a> won. 
<br/>(In the arufumi of the third volume, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Susano.html">Susano</a> gave birth of six male gods.)<br/>
</p>
<p>In the arufumi of the second volume, the story is almost the same as the one in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Kojiki (The Records of Ancient Matters).html">Kojiki</a> that they agreed that the one who bore male gods would win, but it is not mentioned which gods are whose offspring. If the judgment is also the same as the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Kojiki (The Records of Ancient Matters).html">Kojiki</a> (to be an offspring of a god who owned the thing), it results in Amaterasu's victory. </p>
<p>In either case, it is said that the god who produced male gods would win. The following theory has been most influential: As the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Kojiki (The Records of Ancient Matters).html">Kojiki</a> was compiled and edited in the period of the empress, such as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Empress Jito.html">Empress Jito</a> and the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Empress Genmei.html">Empress Genmei</a>; the story in it was altered so that the goddess won. </p>
<p>Commentary<br/>
There is a theory saying that <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Susano.html">Susano</a> won in the original legend by producing a male god and that Masakatsuakatsu kachihayahi was <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Susano.html">Susano</a>'s offspring by the following reasons. </p>
<p>The name Masakatsuakatsu means 'I will win without doubt and I will win,' and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Susano.html">Susano</a> won in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan).html">Nihonshoki</a>. </p>
<p>In the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Kojiki (The Records of Ancient Matters).html">Kojiki</a>, it says that Amaterasu took on Kachihayahi and looked after him. </p>
<p>In the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan).html">Nihonshoki</a>, Amaterasu gave the Munakata gods an order. </p>
<p>She asked them, being halfway on the road to Karakuni (present-day China and Korea), to be sure to protect the imperial descendants, using honorific language. </p>
