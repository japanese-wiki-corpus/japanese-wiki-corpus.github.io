<h1>MINAMOTO no Muneyuki (源宗于)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>MINAMOTO no Muneyuki (year of birth unknown - January 9, 940)was a poet of the early to mid-Heian period. His father was the son of the Emperor Koko, Imperial Prince Koretada. He is regarded as one of the medieval 36 Immortal Poets. </p>
<p>He received the family name of Minamoto and became a commoner in 894, but was not favored with promotions and remained Shoshiinoge, Ukyo no daibu (Senior Fourth Rank, Lower Grade, mayor of the right capital district). He participated in some uta-awase (poetry contests) such as the 'Kanpyo kisai no miya no uta-awase' (Empress's Contest During the Reign of the Kanpyo Emperor) and was acquainted with KI no Tsurayuki and others. He also appears in 'Yamato Monogatari' (the Tales of Yamato). </p>
<p>Poetry by him was selected for the 'Kokin Wakashu' (the Collection of Ancient and Modern Japanese Poetry) and other Chokusen wakashu (anthology of Japanese poetry compiled by Imperial command) afterwards. 
<br/>He has a personal collection called 'Muneyuki-Shu.'<br/>

No. 28: In winter, being in a hamlet in the mountains makes me even more lonesome, now that the people who came to see me have stopped visiting and the grass in the fields has died off. ('Kokin wakashu' (Collection of Ancient and Modern Poems) Winter, 315)<br/>
