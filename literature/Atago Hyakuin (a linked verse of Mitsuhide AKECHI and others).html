Atago (Kyoto City).html">Mt. Atago</a> in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> immediately before his coup, the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Honnoji Incident.html">Honnoji Incident</a>. It is also known as 'Akechi Mitsuhide Chogyo Hyakuin' (100 verses composed by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Mitsuhide AKECHI.html">Mitsuhide AKECHI</a> and others). </p>
<p>Summary<br/>
It is a poem of 100 links composed on June 24 (or 28), 1582, by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Mitsuhide AKECHI.html">Mitsuhide AKECHI</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Mitsuyoshi AKECHI.html">Mitsuyoshi AKECHI</a>, Gyocho AZUMA, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Joha SATOMURA.html">Joha SATOMURA</a>, Shoshitsu SATOMURA, Kennyo INAWASHIRO, Shinzen SATOMURA, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Yugen.html">Yugen</a>, and Gyoyu at Itokuin Temple on <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Mt. Atago (Kyoto City).html">Mt. Atago</a> in Yamashiro Province. The first line was 'Toki wa Ima Ame ga Shita-shiru Satsuki kana' (It is May, a rainy season) composed by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Mitsuhide AKECHI.html">Mitsuhide AKECHI</a>; the second 'Minakami masaru Niwa no Natsuyama' (river flow flashes in the garden on summer mountain) composed by Itokuin Gyoyu; and the third 'Hana otsuru Ike no nagare wo Sekitomete' (falling flowers keep back the flow of the pond) composed by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Joha SATOMURA.html">Joha SATOMURA</a>. The first line is supposed to include the word 'Toki' (meaning 'It is') also implied Mitsuhide's surname, and 'Ame ga Shita' also meant '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Tenka (the realm).html">Tenka</a>' (the whole country), to show his long-held wish of killing his master <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Nobunaga ODA.html">Nobunaga ODA</a> for which Joha demanded an explanation later. 
<br/>It is said that 'Ame ga Shita-shiru' (to have the meaning 'coming into power' as well) in the first line was changed from 'Ame ga Shita-naru.'<br/>
