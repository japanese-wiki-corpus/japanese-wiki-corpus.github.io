<h1>Atago Hyakuin (a linked verse of Mitsuhide AKECHI and others) (愛宕百韻)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Atago Hyakuin was a linked verse known as Renga, which was composed by Mitsuhide AKECHI and others at Mt. Atago in Kyoto immediately before his coup, the Honnoji Incident. It is also known as 'Akechi Mitsuhide Chogyo Hyakuin' (100 verses composed by Mitsuhide AKECHI and others). </p>
<p>Summary<br/>
It is a poem of 100 links composed on June 24 (or 28), 1582, by Mitsuhide AKECHI, Mitsuyoshi AKECHI, Gyocho AZUMA, Joha SATOMURA, Shoshitsu SATOMURA, Kennyo INAWASHIRO, Shinzen SATOMURA, Yugen, and Gyoyu at Itokuin Temple on Mt. Atago in Yamashiro Province. The first line was 'Toki wa Ima Ame ga Shita-shiru Satsuki kana' (It is May, a rainy season) composed by Mitsuhide AKECHI; the second 'Minakami masaru Niwa no Natsuyama' (river flow flashes in the garden on summer mountain) composed by Itokuin Gyoyu; and the third 'Hana otsuru Ike no nagare wo Sekitomete' (falling flowers keep back the flow of the pond) composed by Joha SATOMURA. The first line is supposed to include the word 'Toki' (meaning 'It is') also implied Mitsuhide's surname, and 'Ame ga Shita' also meant 'Tenka' (the whole country), to show his long-held wish of killing his master Nobunaga ODA for which Joha demanded an explanation later. 
<br/>It is said that 'Ame ga Shita-shiru' (to have the meaning 'coming into power' as well) in the first line was changed from 'Ame ga Shita-naru.'<br/>
