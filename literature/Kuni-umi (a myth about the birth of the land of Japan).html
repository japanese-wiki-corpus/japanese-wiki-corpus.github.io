<p>Furthermore, the tale of the Kuni-umi is followed by the tale of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Kami-umi (a myth about giving birth to gods).html">Kami-umi</a> (the birth of gods). </p>
<p>This article will mention how Oyashima (the great islands; referring to Japan) were formed in Japanese myth. </p>
<p>Summary<br/>
<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Kojiki (The Records of Ancient Matters).html">Kojiki</a><br/>
According to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Kojiki (The Records of Ancient Matters).html">Kojiki</a>, Oyashima was born as follows. </p>
<p>The two gods of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Izanagi.html">Izanagi</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Izanami.html">Izanami</a> were ordered to complete the drifting land by Kotoamatsugami (literally, Separate heavenly god) and others. Kotoamatsugami and others gave the two gods Ame no nuboko (the heavenly jeweled spear). <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Izanagi.html">Izanagi</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Izanami.html">Izanami</a> stood on the Ame no Ukihashi (the Heavenly floating bridge) and mixed the chaotic land with Ame no nuboko. Then something dripping from the pike piled up to be an island. This island is called <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Onogoro-jima Island (an island in a Japanese myth).html">Onogoro-jima Island</a>. </p>
<p>The two gods stepped down onto <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Onogoro-jima Island (an island in a Japanese myth).html">Onogoro-jima Island</a>, had a conversation, and got married. Quotations from <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Kojiki (The Records of Ancient Matters).html">Kojiki</a>. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Izanagi.html">Izanagi</a><br/>

</p>
<p>Then two gods began performing a sexual act. However, it was <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Izanami.html">Izanami</a>, a female god, who seduced <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Izanagi.html">Izanagi</a>, a male god, before sexual intercourse, so a normal child was not born. The first born child was called <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Hiruko.html">Hiruko</a> (literally, Leech Child; God of the Morning Sun) and the two gods swept the baby away on a boat made of reed. Next, Awashima was born. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Hiruko.html">Hiruko</a> and Awashima are not counted as children of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Izanagi.html">Izanagi</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Izanami.html">Izanami</a>. </p>
<p>The two gods who could not have normal children visited Kotoamatsugami to ask him what to do. Then the fortune-telling showed that it was not good for woman to ask a man to have sex. Therefore the two gods returned to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Onogoro-jima Island (an island in a Japanese myth).html">Onogoro-jima Island</a>, and this time the male god, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Izanagi.html">Izanagi</a>, asked her to have sex. </p>
<p><h3>Shima-umi</h3>
</p>
<p>Then the two gods generated islands that made up Oyashima. These islands are as follows in the order created. </p>
<p>Awaji no Ho no Sawake no Shima: Awaji-shima Island<br/>
Iyo no Futana no Shima: Shikoku Island<br/>
It had one body and four faces. The names of the faces are as follows. </p>
<p>Ehime: Iyo Province<br/>
Ihiyorihiko: Sanuki Province<br/>
<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Ogetsuhime.html">Ogetsuhime</a>: Awa Province (later it also appears as a god of food)<br/>
Takeyoriwake: Tosa Province<br/>
Oki no Mitsugo no Shima: Oki no shima Island<br/>
It was also called Ame no Oshikorowake. 
<br/>Tsukushi no Shima: Kyushu Island<br/>
It had one body and four faces. The names of the faces are as follows. </p>
<p>Shirahiwake: Tsukushi Province<br/>
Toyohiwake: Toyo Province<br/>
Takehimukahitoyojihinewake: Hi Province<br/>
Takehiwake: Kumaso Province<br/>
Ikinoshima: Iki no shima Island<br/>
It was also called Amehitotsubashira. 
<br/>Tsushima: Tsushima no shima Island<br/>
It was also called Ame no Sadeyorihime. 
<br/>Sado no Shima: Sadoga-shima Island<br/>
Oyamato Toyoakitsushima: Honshu (the main island of Japan)<br/>
It was also called Amatsumisoratoyoakitsunewake. </p>
<p>Because the above eight islands were first generated, Japan was called Oyashima no kuni (The Land of Eight Great Islands). The two gods created another six islands continuously. </p>
<p>Kibi no Kojima: The Kojima Peninsula<br/>
It was also called Takehikatawake. 
<br/>Azukijima: Shodo-shima Island<br/>
It was also called Onodehime. 
<br/>Oshima: Suo-oshima Island<br/>
It was also called Otamaruwake. 
<br/>Himejima: Himejima Village<br/>
It was also called Amehitotsune. 
<br/>Chika no Shima: The Goto Islands<br/>
It was also called Ame no Oshio. 
<br/>Futago no Shima: The Danjo Archipelago<br/>
It was also called Amefutaya. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan).html">Nihonshoki</a> (Chronicles of Japan)<br/>
According to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan).html">Nihonshoki</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Izanagi.html">Izanagi</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Izanami.html">Izanami</a> basically took action and moved the Kuni-umi forward voluntarily (Section four of the First Volume). <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Izanagi.html">Izanagi</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Izanami.html">Izanami</a> were also called gods of yang and yin respectively, which suggests a strong influence of cosmic dual forces ideology. </p>
<p>The chronicle states that <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Izanagi.html">Izanagi</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Izanami.html">Izanami</a> stood on the Ame no Ukihashi to mix chaotic land with the Ame no nuboko, just like they did in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Kojiki (The Records of Ancient Matters).html">Kojiki</a>. At this time, something that fell from the spear piled up and an island was made. However, the other heavenly gods do not appear then. <h3>Comparative table</h3>
