<h1>Chuyuki (中右記)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Chuyuki is a diary written by FUJIWARA no Munetada, Nakamikado Udaijin (Minister of the Right), for over 50 years from 1087 to 1138. It is one of the basic historical documents from the early Insei period (the period of the government by the retired Emperor). This diary is a valuable document that describes the politics, social situation, Yusoku kojitsu (traditional court and samurai rules of ceremony and etiquette), and portraits of notable people of those days. A manuscript of this book from the Kamakura period is owned by the Imperial Household Archives. </p>
