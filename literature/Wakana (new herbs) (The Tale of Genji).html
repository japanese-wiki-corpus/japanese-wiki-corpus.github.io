<h1>Wakana (new herbs) (<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/The Tale of Genji.html">The Tale of Genji</a>) (若菜 (源氏物語))</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Wakana is one of the fifty-four chapters of "<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/The Tale of Genji.html">The Tale of Genji</a>." This is the thirty-fourth chapter. This chapter was the longest of all the chapters in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/The Tale of Genji.html">The Tale of Genji</a>, but today it is split into two volumes consisting of 'Wakana, Volume one' and 'Wakana, Volume two,' being regarded the thirty-fourth chapter and thirty-fifth chapter respectively, and the chapter of '<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Kumogakure.html">Kumogakure</a> (vanish behind the clouds),' which is not extant now, is excluded from the story. The title of this chapter came from the wakana which <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Hikaru Genji.html">Hikaru Genji</a>'s adopted daughter, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Tamakazura (The Tale of Genji).html">Tamakazura</a>, presented him at his fortieth birthday ceremony. 
<br/>Wakana, Volume one' and 'Wakana, Volume two' respectively have another name, 'Hakodori (a cuckoo)' and 'Morokazura (Laurel branches twain).'<br/>
Hakodori' was derived from a poem composed by <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Yugiri (The Tale of Genji).html">Yugiri</a>, 'The cuckoo building its nest in mountain depths does not, be assured, neglect the cherry blossom,' while 'Morokazura' was from <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Kashiwagi (The Tale of Genji).html">Kashiwagi</a>'s poem, 'O, laurel branches twain, why did I take the fallen leaf, though in name it seemed to be as welcome as the other?'<br/>
Morokazura' is sometimes considered another name for both volumes of Wakana. </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>Wakana, Volume one<br/>
<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Hikaru Genji.html">Hikaru Genji</a>, from age thirty-nine in December to age forty-one in March. </p>
<p>Genji's older brother, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Emperor Suzaku.html">Emperor Suzaku</a> has fallen ill and thought of entering into priesthood, but he hesitates because he feels anxious about the future of his beloved daughter, Onna Sannomiya (the Third Princess), who does not have any guardian. Suzaku-in worries about her marriage, and he finally decides to ask Genji to marry her. Genji accepts his offer. <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Murasaki no ue.html">Murasaki no ue</a>, who has been recognized as his virtual legal wife, feels upset, but she prepares to take Onna Sannomiya as Genji's legal wife, hiding her true feelings. </p>
<p>The new year has come, and on the 23rd day, a celebration to commemorate Genji's fortieth birthday is held on a large scale. In February, Onna Sannomiya is married and moves to the Rokujo-in Palace, but Genji is disappointed with her extreme childishness. Meanwhile, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Murasaki no ue.html">Murasaki no ue</a>, who keeps her sorrow to herself for the unexpected event, gradually hopes to enter into priesthood. </p>
<p>In March of the next year, young lady <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Akashi (The Tale of Genji).html">Akashi</a> (Genji's daughter) bears the Emperor a baby boy. Although <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Akashi (The Tale of Genji).html">Akashi</a> no onkata (<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Lady Akashi.html">Lady Akashi</a>) and young lady <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Akashi (The Tale of Genji).html">Akashi</a> are in all their glory, they shed tears when they read a personal letter from <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Priest Akashi.html">Priest Akashi</a>. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Kashiwagi (The Tale of Genji).html">Kashiwagi</a> (a son of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Tono Chujo (a government post).html">Tono Chujo</a> (the first secretary's captain)), who has been anxious for Onna Sannomiya's marriage out of the royal family, has a lingering affection for her even after she was married. At the end of March, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Kashiwagi (The Tale of Genji).html">Kashiwagi</a>, who has visited Rokujo-in Palace to take part in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Kemari (a type of football played by courtiers in ancient Japan).html">kemari</a> (Japanese ancient Imperial court game like kick-ball), happens to catch a glimpse of Onna Sannomiya sitting beyond the raised bamboo blind when a cat pops out. After this, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Kashiwagi (The Tale of Genji).html">Kashiwagi</a>'s love for her grows stronger. </p>
<p>Wakana, Volume two<br/>
<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Hikaru Genji.html">Hikaru Genji</a>, from age forty-one in March to age forty-seven in December. </p>
<p>Four years later, the time has shifted from the reign of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Emperor Reizei.html">Emperor Reizei</a> to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Kinjo no Mikado.html">Kinjo no Mikado</a>. The first Prince, to whom young lady <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Akashi (The Tale of Genji).html">Akashi</a> gave birth, has become the Crown Prince. </p>
<p>Genji teaches Onna Sannomiya how to play kokin (ancient Chinese string instrument) for a celebration ceremony of Suzaku-in's fiftieth birthday to be held the following year. A splendid concert of onnagaku (women's music) is held at Rokujo-in Palace during the New Year's days, and Onna Sannomiya, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Murasaki no ue.html">Murasaki no ue</a>, young lady <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Akashi (The Tale of Genji).html">Akashi</a>, and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Akashi (The Tale of Genji).html">Akashi</a> no onkata all give a wonderful performance, but <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Murasaki no ue.html">Murasaki no ue</a>, in her unlucky age of thirty-seven, suddenly collapses during the night. Her condition does not improve, so Genji moves her to Nijo-in Palace with him, staying with her all the time. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Kashiwagi (The Tale of Genji).html">Kashiwagi</a>, who has married <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Ochiba no miya.html">Ochiba no miya</a>, Onna Sannomiya's older sister, unsatisfied with his marriage, takes the opportunity to commit adultery with Onna Sannomiya with the help of Kojiju, menotogo (the son of a menoto, a woman providing breast-feed to a highborn baby) while Genji is busy staying by <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Murasaki no ue.html">Murasaki no ue</a>'s side to take care of her. Right after their illicit tryst, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Murasaki no ue.html">Murasaki no ue</a> passes out once, but barely revives. Then shiryo (spirit of a dead person) of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Rokujo no Miyasudokoro.html">Rokujo no Miyasudokoro</a> appears and makes Genji shudder. </p>
<p>Onna Sannomiya gets pregnant. At the end of the summer, when <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Murasaki no ue.html">Murasaki no ue</a>'s condition is stable, Genji, who calls on her to inquire after her health, happens to find a love letter from <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Kashiwagi (The Tale of Genji).html">Kashiwagi</a> and finds out the truth. <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Kashiwagi (The Tale of Genji).html">Kashiwagi</a> also notices this, and terrified of his sin, he falls ill to hear Genji's bitter sarcasm at a rehearsal of court dances and music held in Rokujo-in Palace. </p>
<p>The celebration ceremony of Suzaku-in's fiftieth birthday is held on December 25, when the end of the year draws near. </p>
