<h1>Shoryoshu (Collected Works of Prose and Poetry of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Kukai.html">Kukai</a>) (性霊集)</h1>
<p>"Shoryoshu" is a collection of poetry and prose which was written by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Kukai.html">Kukai</a>. It consists of ten volumes. The selector was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Kukai.html">Kukai</a>, and the editor was his disciple, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shinzei.html">Shinzei</a>. The year of creation is unknown. </p>
<p>It is formally called 'Henjo Hokki Shoryo shu.'<br/>
Prose and poetry, written petitions for Buddhist temples, collections of poems, epitaphs, and letters were selected for the collection from the works by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Kukai.html">Kukai</a>. 
<br/>The last three volumes were dispersed and soon lost, but in 1078 <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Saisen.html">Saisen</a>, a priest in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Ninna-ji Temple.html">Ninna-ji Temple</a>, edited the posthumous writings into a three-volume book called 'Shoku Shoryoshu Hoketsusho.'<br/>
The present "Shoryoshu" was made by putting the book together with the original Shoryoshu. </p>
