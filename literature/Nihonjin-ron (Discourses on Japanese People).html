<h1>Nihonjin-ron (Discourses on Japanese People) (日本人論)</h1>

<p></p>
<p>Nihonjin-ron is a study, books, and reports discussed on Japanese people. </p>
<p>Summary<br/>
Originally, the Nihonjin-ron discourses were found in missionaries' reports to their mother countries which were written from the Azuchi-Momoyama to the Edo periods, and experiences told by Japanese fishermen or boatmen who had a chance to see Russia, Canada, or other countries due to an accident or drifting at sea. From the end of the Edo to the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> periods, the Nihonjin-ron discourses were written in the reports by overseas inspection teams from Japan cultural antholopological observations and essays by foreigners visiting Japan, and so on. </p>
<p>After the Sino-Japanese War, the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Russo-Japanese War.html">Russo-Japanese War</a>, and two world wars, foreign people took growing interests in Japanese strategies and tactics, a moral sense, and what was behind loyalty and patriotism, so a Japan study was pursued such as "The Chrysanthemum and the Sword" by Ruth Benedict and "Zen in the Art of Archery" by Eugen Herrigel. </p>
<p>After the World War II, various books on Nihonjin-ron were written again by raising awareness about Japanese social infrastructure that supported marvelous progress in economy. Most of them inclusively treated Japanese people as a standardized group, ignoring historical changes and class differences, and uniqueness was discussed through a comparison with foreign countries and cultures. This genre of book becomes popular now and even some best-sellers were brought out. Some people claim that such a phenomenon cannot be seen in the world except Japan. However, it is because the countries compared with Japan in the essays were powerful developed countries such as U.S. and European countries, especially U.K., France, Germany, and so on, which were considered more excellent than Japan in the past. </p>
<p>If you look away from these countries, discourses on own ethnic group are popular in other countries such as Turkey, South Korea, Malaysia, and so on. Therefore it can be said that the idea itself that the Nihonjin-ron discourses are special is typical in the discourses on own ethnic group in other countries. </p>
<p>There are discourses on Japanese people from the view of cultural anthropology or the study of sociology, while many books are also written by Japanese writers and published in order to emphasize especially their own peculiarity based on their feelings of nationalism. So there are scholars such as Peter N. Dale (1986), Harumi Befu (1987), Kosaku YOSHINO (1992), and others who study the Nihonjin-ron critically as they consider such discourses as a form of cultural nationalism. That is why today the Nihonjin-ron discourses are generally considered not as a genre of study but as 'criticism' by the academic people. </p>
<p>Characteristics of the Nihonjin-ron Discourses<br/>
Yoshio SUGIMOTO and Mouer (1982) pointed out that many of the Nihonjin-ron shared the following three basic opinions. Japanese people have weak ego-strength at the level of individual psychology. 
<br/>They do not establish Independent 'self.'<br/>
</p>
<p>Japanese people are group-oriented at the level of human relations. The relationships between Japanese people are characterized by 'groupism;' Japanese spontaneously devote themselves to the group which they belong to. </p>
<p>At the level of whole society, the principles of consensus, harmony, and integration are accepted. Therefore the society is extremely stable and people have a strong sense of unity. </p>
<p>On the other hand, the tone of argument in the Nihonjin-ron has changed, reflecting social conditions in each period. For example, in the desolated days after the war, while Japan was aiming at reconstruction as a democratic nation, unique feudal system and custom left in Japan were critically inspected, being compared with those in the U.S. and the Western European countries. When a period of high economic growth came, however, peculiarity of Japan came to be reconsidered positively. </p>
<p>Tamotsu AOKI (1990) classified such changes in the Nihonjin-ron which were written after the war into four periods. </p>
<p>The first period, 'recognition of negative peculiarity' (1945 - 54)<br/>
"The Chrysanthemum and the Sword" (1948), "Family Structure in Japanese Society" (1948), and so on. 
<br/>The second period, 'recognition of historical relativity' (1955 - 63)<br/>
"Hybrid Culture" (1956), and so on. 
<br/>The third period, 'recognition of positive peculiarity,' the prior period (1964 - 1976) and the latter period (1977 - 1983)<br/>
"The Anatomy of Dependence" (1973), "Japan as Number One" (1979), and so on. 
<br/>The fourth period, 'from specialty to generality' (1984 -)<br/>
</p>
<p>Although they are the same Japanese, it has to be taken into consideration that their characters are much differ from age to age. So vigorous studies in various places in different periods are waited. In the first place, to apply a racial characteristic or a national characteristic to an individual high-handedly can bring out a prejudice if it goes too far, so it is a dangerous action. </p>
<p>The number of books and classification of the Nihonjin-ron discourses<br/>
