In order to console the deeply grieving Emperor, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Fujitsubo.html">Fujitsubo</a>, who looks exactly like the late Koi, is sent to the Imperial court and wins the Emperor's favor. The child of the late Koi is brought up under the protection of the Emperor, and comes to love <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Fujitsubo.html">Fujitsubo</a>, who is said to look like his lost mother. He celebrates his coming of age, being given the name of Genji and getting married to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Lady Aoi.html">Lady Aoi</a>, a daughter of the House of the Sadijin (Minister of the Left), and people come to call him <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Hikaru Genji.html">Hikaru Genji</a> because of his shining beauty. See <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Kiritsubo.html">Kiritsubo</a>. <h3>Blank</h3>

</p>
<p>(Genji, age 17, summer)<br/>
</p>
<p>One night, when an early summer rain is falling, young court nobles gather around Genji, who is on night duty, and have a chat about ladies, in an episode known as 'rating woman on a rainy night.'<br/>
On the following day, Genji has a relationship with <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Utsusemi (The Tale of Genji).html">Utsusemi</a> (lady of the cicada shell), a wife of Iyo no Suke (Iyo Deputy), at her residence which he has visited for ritual abstention. Genji wins over her younger brother to his side, and tries to meet her again and again in vain, but <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Utsusemi (The Tale of Genji).html">Utsusemi</a> keeps strongly refusing him. See The Broom Tree. <h3><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Utsusemi (The Tale of Genji).html">Utsusemi</a> (The Cicada Shell)</h3>

When night falls, Genji sneaks into her bedroom, but <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Utsusemi (The Tale of Genji).html">Utsusemi</a> senses he is coming and runs away leaving her clothes behind. Genji gets home holding her clothes which look like the empty shell of a cicada. See <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Utsusemi (The Tale of Genji).html">Utsusemi</a>. <h3><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Yugao (The Tale of Genji).html">Yugao</a> (Evening face)</h3>

<p>Disclosing his identity, Genji has a sexual relationship with <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Yugao (The Tale of Genji).html">Yugao</a>, who lives around Gojo. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Yugao (The Tale of Genji).html">Yugao</a> is the missing lover of To no Chujo, Genji's best friend. Genji loves the pretty and obedient <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Yugao (The Tale of Genji).html">Yugao</a> deeply, but <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Rokujo no Miyasudokoro.html">Rokujo no Miyasudokoro</a> is so jealous of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Yugao (The Tale of Genji).html">Yugao</a> that her spirit possesses <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Yugao (The Tale of Genji).html">Yugao</a> and causes her death. Genji deeply laments the death of the lady. See <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Yugao (The Tale of Genji).html">Yugao</a>. <h3><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Wakamurasaki.html">Wakamurasaki</a> (Young Murasaki)</h3>
</p>
<p>(Genji, age 18, from March to winter)<br/>
</p>
<p>The following spring, Genji visits the Northern Hills to perform incantations, finding a beautiful little girl there who lives with her grandmother and others. Genji is infatuated with the girl, a niece of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Fujitsubo.html">Fujitsubo</a>, and asks the nun to take responsibility for her, but the nun refuses his offer. In the summer, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Fujitsubo.html">Fujitsubo</a> takes a short leave from service due to her illness. Genji has a second secret meeting with <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Fujitsubo.html">Fujitsubo</a> and right after that her pregnancy is revealed. In winter, Genji takes the little girl from the Northern Hills to his residence in an act which is tantamount to kidnapping. It is this girl, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Wakamurasaki.html">Wakamurasaki</a>, who will be known as Lady Murasaki later. See <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Wakamurasaki.html">Wakamurasaki</a>. <h3><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Suetsumuhana (The Tale of Genji).html">Suetsumuhana</a> (The Safflower)</h3>
</p>
<p>(Genji, age 18 in spring to 19, New Years day)<br/>
</p>
<p>Genji and To no Chujo are possessed by a rumor that a daughter of Prince Hitachi is living in sad circumstances, and compete with each other in their advances to her. Genji succeeds in having a relationship with her sooner than To no Chujo, and is surprised to find her an ugly lady with a long red nose. Because the tip of her nose was red as though it had been stained with a safflower, she is called <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Suetsumuhana (The Tale of Genji).html">Suetsumuhana</a> (the lady of the safflower). See <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Suetsumuhana (The Tale of Genji).html">Suetsumuhana</a>. <h3><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Momiji no Ga.html">Momiji no Ga</a> (The Autumn Excursion)</h3>

<p>When Emperor holds the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Momiji no Ga.html">Momiji no Ga</a> (the autumn excursion) to celebrate the Retired Emperor's birthday, Genji performs a dance. His dancing is also seen in the Imperial court, and its high courtiers, as well as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Fujitsubo.html">Fujitsubo</a>, are filled with admiration for Genji. In the following spring <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Fujitsubo.html">Fujitsubo</a> gives birth to a baby boy.

<p>In the following spring, after the festival of the cherry blossoms is held at the Imperial court, Genji has an affair with a princess. At the end of the spring, Genji, invited to a feast held at the residence of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Udaijin (Minister of the Right).html">Udaijin</a> (Minister of the Right), knows that she is a daughter of his political enemy the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Udaijin (Minister of the Right).html">Udaijin</a>, and moreover, she is the woman called <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Oborozukiyo (The Tale of Genji).html">Oborozukiyo</a> (the misty moon), who is going to be married to Genji's older brother.

</p>
<p>Two years later. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Emperor Kiritsubo.html">Emperor Kiritsubo</a> has already abdicated the throne and Genji's older brother (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Emperor Suzaku.html">Emperor Suzaku</a>) has ascended to it. At the Aoi festival, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Rokujo no Miyasudokoro.html">Rokujo no Miyasudokoro</a> is humiliated by lady Aoi over a quarrel about where their carriages are to be kept, and feels great bitterness toward her.

</p>
<p>(Genji, age 23 in September to 25 in summer)<br/>
</p>
<p><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Rokujo no Miyasudokoro.html">Rokujo no Miyasudokoro</a> is afraid of her own vicious spirit, so when her daughter becomes a high priestess, she decides to go down to Ise Province with her daughter, to confine and purify herself in the temporary shrine at <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Sagano.html">Sagano</a>. In the late autumn, Genji visits her and is reluctant to leave. In winter, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Emperor Kiritsubo.html">Emperor Kiritsubo</a> dies. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Fujitsubo.html">Fujitsubo</a> agonizes over her relationship with Genji and becomes a priestess. The relationship between Genji and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Oborozukiyo (The Tale of Genji).html">Oborozukiyo</a> continues even after her marriage. The next summer, Genji's secret meeting with <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Oborozukiyo (The Tale of Genji).html">Oborozukiyo</a> is discovered by the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Udaijin (Minister of the Right).html">Udaijin</a>. Because of this, Genji, who has become involved in the political conflict between the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Udaijin (Minister of the Right).html">Udaijin</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Sadaijin (Minister of the Left).html">Sadaijin</a> (Minister of the Left) after the death of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Emperor Kiritsubo.html">Emperor Kiritsubo</a>, is put in a difficult situation.

</p>
<p>(Genji, age 25, May)<br/>
</p>
<p>During a break in the early summer rain, Genji visits lady Reikeiden, one of the court ladies of the late <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Emperor Kiritsubo.html">Emperor Kiritsubo</a>. At her residence in which she lives a quiet, charming life like something out of an old tale, Genji remembers the days of the reign of his father the emperor. The encounter with <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Hanachirusato.html">Hanachirusato</a>, who is a younger sister of the lady and to be one of Genji's wives, is not mentioned in the work, but the author wrote of their reunion after many years. See <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Hanachirusato.html">Hanachirusato</a>. <h3>Suma</h3>
</p>
<p>(Genji, age 26 in March to 27 in March)<br/>
</p>
<p><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Hikaru Genji.html">Hikaru Genji</a> senses that he is being punished, so takes the initiative, secluding himself from society to Suma. It is pitiful to see Genji, worried about lady Murasaki, say good-bye to all the women with whom he has had relations and leave Kyo. In the following spring on March 3, a storm strikes the beach where Genji is performing his ablutions. Around the same time, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Priest Akashi.html">Priest Akashi</a>, who lives in a neighboring province, knows that Genji is staying temporarily in Suma, so he plans to make his daughter marry Genji. See Suma. <h3><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Akashi (The Tale of Genji).html">Akashi</a></h3>
</p>
<p>(Genji, age 27 in March to 28 in August)<br/>
</p>
<p>Genji has a revelation in a dream in which <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Emperor Kiritsubo.html">Emperor Kiritsubo</a> encourages him to leave Suma, so he follows the revelation and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Priest Akashi.html">Priest Akashi</a> takes him in his residence. Genji has a relationship with lady <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Akashi (The Tale of Genji).html">Akashi</a>, a daughter of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Priest Akashi.html">Priest Akashi</a>, and before long the first signs of her pregnancy become apparent. Meanwhile at the capital, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Emperor Suzaku.html">Emperor Suzaku</a> has a dream in which <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Emperor Kiritsubo.html">Emperor Kiritsubo</a> appears and tells him that Genji is innocent, blaming <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Suzaku (the Vermilion Bird).html">Suzaku</a>. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/The Emperor (Tenno).html">The Emperor</a> regrets expelling Genji and issues an order to bring him back to the capital. Genji heads for Kyo hastily, being still attached to lady <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Akashi (The Tale of Genji).html">Akashi</a>. See <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Akashi (The Tale of Genji).html">Akashi</a>. <h3><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Miotsukushi (The Tale of Genji).html">Miotsukushi</a> (Channel Buoys)</h3>
</p>
<p>(Genji, age 28 in October to 29 in winter)<br/>
</p>
<p>After Genji has returned to the capital, he embarks smoothly on a career in politics again, and embarks on the high road to success. The following year, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Emperor Suzaku.html">Emperor Suzaku</a> abdicates the throne. And then <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Emperor Reizei.html">Emperor Reizei</a>, the child of Genji and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Fujitsubo.html">Fujitsubo</a>, succeeds to the throne. In autumn, Genji pays a visit to the Sumiyoshi <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Taisha.html">Taisha</a> shrine, which has guarded him in exile at Suma <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Akashi (The Tale of Genji).html">Akashi</a>. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Lady Akashi.html">Lady Akashi</a> also visits the shrine at the same time by chance, but they couldn't meet again. Also, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Rokujo no Miyasudokoro.html">Rokujo no Miyasudokoro</a> and her daughter priestess return to the capital because when the new Emperor succeeds to the throne, the priestess also has to be changed. Before long Miyasudokoro dies of disease. According to her will, Genji adopts her daughter, making her a court lady of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Emperor Reizei.html">Emperor Reizei</a>.
