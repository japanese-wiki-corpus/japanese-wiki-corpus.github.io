<h1>Takamagahara kochihi (高天原故地碑)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Takamagahara kochihi is a stone monument placed at Kaya University in Goryeong-gun, Gyeongbuk, Korea. It is inscribed on the statue that this is the place of Takamanohara (plain of high heaven) where Amatsukami (heavenly gods) in Japanese Mythology resided. </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>It had been long since people argued that Takamanohara reflected an actual place, and after the World War II, amateur researchers were main advocates of the Korean Peninsula theory. At first, the presumed location was not Goryeong-gun, Gyeongbuk but Chuncheon, Gangwon Province, the place which some researchers prior to WWII designated as a candidate for Soshimori, Shiragi (ancient Korean kingdom) where Susanoo stopped by, and it is today famous for a location site of Korean TV show "Fuyu no Sonata." </p>
<p>Goryeong-gun gave its name as the presumed location instead of Chuncheon. The President of Kaya University, Dr. Kyung-Hee Lee was the advocate of this theory and the stone monument inscribed "Takamagahara kochihi" was built on June 28, 1999. </p>
<p>Kyung-Hee Lee's argument<br/>
Dr. Kyung-Hee Lee argued as follows:<br/>
The name Takamimusuhi no Mikoto (高皇産霊尊) includes Kanji characters 高 and 霊, indicating he was born in Goryeong-gun (高霊郡). </p>
<p>Izanami sounds similar to Ijinangi, the second son of Ibika, the heavenly god of Kaya, as described in "Togoku Yochi Shoran." Therefore, Ijinangi is Izanami. </p>
<p>The kanji character 任 in 任那 (Mimana) means "Master" or "Mother" in Korean today. Therefore, Mimana means "The Country of Master" or "The Mother Country." </p>
<p>Soriyama in Takachiho sounds similar to Seoul, the capital of Korea. Therefore, Soriyama refers to Seoul. </p>
<p>That is what Dr. Lee stated. </p>
<p>His argument won approval of Kazuo MABUCHI, Professor Emeritus of University Tsukuba who visited Korea in 2001. At a conference hosted by Professor Lee during this visit, Professor Mabuchi stated that "Koreans conquered Japan and built the Yamato Dynasty." </p>
