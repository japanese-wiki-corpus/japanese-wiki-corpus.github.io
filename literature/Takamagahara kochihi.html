<h1>Takamagahara kochihi (高天原故地碑)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Takamagahara kochihi is a stone monument placed at Kaya University in Goryeong-gun, Gyeongbuk, Korea. It is inscribed on the statue that this is the place of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Takamanohara (plain of high heaven).html">Takamanohara</a> (plain of high heaven) where Amatsukami (heavenly gods) in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Japanese Mythology.html">Japanese Mythology</a> resided. </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>It had been long since people argued that <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Takamanohara (plain of high heaven).html">Takamanohara</a> reflected an actual place, and after the World War II, amateur researchers were main advocates of the Korean Peninsula theory. At first, the presumed location was not Goryeong-gun, Gyeongbuk but Chuncheon, Gangwon Province, the place which some researchers prior to WWII designated as a candidate for Soshimori, Shiragi (ancient Korean kingdom) where Susanoo stopped by, and it is today famous for a location site of Korean TV show "Fuyu no Sonata." </p>
<p>Goryeong-gun gave its name as the presumed location instead of Chuncheon. The President of Kaya University, Dr. Kyung-Hee Lee was the advocate of this theory and the stone monument inscribed "Takamagahara kochihi" was built on June 28, 1999. </p>
<p>Kyung-Hee Lee's argument<br/>
Dr. Kyung-Hee Lee argued as follows:<br/>
The name Takamimusuhi no Mikoto (高皇産霊尊) includes Kanji characters 高 and 霊, indicating he was born in Goryeong-gun (高霊郡). </p>
<p><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Izanami.html">Izanami</a> sounds similar to Ijinangi, the second son of Ibika, the heavenly god of Kaya, as described in "Togoku Yochi Shoran." Therefore, Ijinangi is <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Izanami.html">Izanami</a>. </p>
<p>The kanji character 任 in 任那 (Mimana) means "Master" or "Mother" in Korean today. Therefore, Mimana means "The Country of Master" or "The Mother Country." </p>
<p>Soriyama in Takachiho sounds similar to Seoul, the capital of Korea. Therefore, Soriyama refers to Seoul. </p>
<p>That is what Dr. Lee stated. </p>
<p>His argument won approval of Kazuo MABUCHI, Professor Emeritus of University Tsukuba who visited Korea in 2001. At a conference hosted by Professor Lee during this visit, Professor Mabuchi stated that "Koreans conquered Japan and built the Yamato Dynasty." </p>
