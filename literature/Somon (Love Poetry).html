<h1>Somon (Love Poetry) (相聞)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Somon is one of the three main poetic categories to constitute the old collection of poetry "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Manyoshu (Collection of Ten Thousand Leaves).html">Manyoshu</a>" together with Zoka (Miscellaneous Poem) and Banka (Laments). It means keeping in touch with each other by exchanging the words to ask after safety. </p>
<p>It originally meant poems and personal notes and letters of the Chinese classics addressed to a wide variety of people including family members and friends to exchange personal feelings, but in "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Manyoshu (Collection of Ten Thousand Leaves).html">Manyoshu</a>", poetry about love between men and women was categorized as Somon. Somon is considered equivalent to the category of 'love poems' in imperial anthologies of poetry "Kokinwakashu" and subsequent ones. </p>
