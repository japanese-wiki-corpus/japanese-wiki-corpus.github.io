<h1>Tsutsumi <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Chunagon.html">Chunagon</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Monogatari.html">Monogatari</a> (堤中納言物語)</h1>

<p>Tsutsumi <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Chunagon.html">Chunagon</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Monogatari.html">Monogatari</a> (The Riverside Counselor's Tales) is a collection of short stories edited in the late Heian period or later in Japan. The editor is unknown. It consists of ten short story pieces, and one incomplete fragment. The pieces were written by different authors at various times. The latest piece was most likely written in the 13th century or later. </p>
<p>Except for "Osaka Koenu Gon <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Chunagon.html">Chunagon</a>," the authors of all ten pieces and exactly when they were written are unknown. 
<br/>However, "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Fuyo Wakashu.html">Fuyo Wakashu</a>" (collection of Japanese poems based on fictional stories), edited in 1271, contains poetry from the same, 'Hanazakura Oru Shosho (Chusho),' 'Haizumi,' 'Hodohodo no Keso,' and '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kaiawase (shell-matching).html">Kaiawase</a>.'<br/>
Therefore, the stories were certainly written before 1271. </p>
<p>None of the ten stories has a character called Tsutsumi <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Chunagon.html">Chunagon</a>. How and why it was so titled is unknown. 
<br/>According to one theory, it was called 'Tsutsumi no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Monogatari.html">Monogatari</a>' because various stories (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Monogatari.html">monogatari</a>) were wrapped (tsutsumi) so that the stories might not come <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Apart (Apartment).html">apart</a>; then it was related to a real person, Tsutsumi <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Chunagon.html">Chunagon</a> (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/FUJIWARA no Kanesuke.html">FUJIWARA no Kanesuke</a>) and in the end became 'Tsutsumi <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Chunagon.html">Chunagon</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Monogatari.html">Monogatari</a>.'<br/>
In addition, there are various other theories. </p>
<p><h3>Details</h3>
</p>
<p>It consists of the following ten stories and an incomplete fragment. The order and titles of the stories may differ depending on the manuscript. Furthermore, all existing manuscripts were written in the Edo period. <h3>Osaka Koenu Gon <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Chunagon.html">Chunagon</a></h3>
</p>
<p>It is the only story whose author and year of writing are identified. It was written in 1055 by Koshikibu (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Koshikibu no Naishi.html">Koshikibu no Naishi</a> is a different person). The story was originally written for the 'Rokujosaiin <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Monogatari.html">Monogatari</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Awase.html">awase</a>' (Collection of unusual stories with Japanese poems). It depicts the so-called '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kaoru.html">Kaoru</a> style' (indecisive style like that of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kaoru.html">Kaoru</a>, a character of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/The Tale of Genji.html">The Tale of Genji</a>) love of a young noble. </p>

<p>Story line: The princess of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Azechi.html">Azechi</a> (inspector of the provincial government) chief councillor of state is beautiful and noble.

</p>
<p>There are various views on the title; They may be broadly classified as follows.
