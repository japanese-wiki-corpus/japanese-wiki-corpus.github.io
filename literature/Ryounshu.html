The entire anthology is one volume and its official title is Ryouunshinshu.

Within the anthology, there were 23 writers, including Emperor Heijo, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Saga.html">Emperor Saga</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Junna.html">Emperor Junna</a> composing a total of 90 poems.
