<h1>Ryounshu (凌雲集)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Ryounshu (lit. a collection from above the clouds) is the first anthology of Chinese poems compiled in Japan by the command of Emperor Saga in 814 during the early Heian period. The entire anthology is one volume and its official title is Ryouunshinshu. Ryounshu was compiled by a number of people, including ONO no Minemori and SUGAWARA no Kiyokimi. Within the anthology, there were 23 writers, including Emperor Heijo, Emperor Saga and Emperor Junna composing a total of 90 poems. One additional poem was subsequently added to the collection, whereby the existing Ryounshu consists of 91 poems. </p>
