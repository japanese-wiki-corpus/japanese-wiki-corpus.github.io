<h1>Kumoi no kari (雲居の雁)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kumoi no kari is a fictitious character that appears in "Genji <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Monogatari.html">Monogatari</a>" (<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/The Tale of Genji.html">The Tale of Genji</a>) by <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Murasaki Shikibu.html">Murasaki Shikibu</a>. The name "Kumoi no kari" does not appear in the text, and she was named so by posterity after the episode in the volume '<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Shojo.html">Shojo</a> (girl)' (Genji <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Monogatari.html">Monogatari</a>) in which she hummed 'Kumoi no kari mo wagagotoya (if a goose flying in the fog feels as I do now)' expressing her sentiment after having been forced to part with <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Yugiri (The Tale of Genji).html">Yugiri</a>. </p>
<p>She was a daughter of To no chujo (elder brother of Aoi no ue). Her mother divorced early on and became the wife of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Azechi.html">Azechi</a> <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Dainagon (chief councilor of state).html">Dainagon</a>, so she was brought up by her grandmother <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Omiya (The Tale of Genji).html">Omiya</a> together with <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Yugiri (The Tale of Genji).html">Yugiri</a>, who was a child of Hikaru genji and also had <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Omiya (The Tale of Genji).html">Omiya</a> as his grandmother, and due to this they grew to love each other since childhood. As a young girl, she was placid and shy. </p>
<p>In the era of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Emperor Reizei.html">Emperor Reizei</a>, as the first daughter of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Naidaijin (inner minister).html">naidaijin</a> (minister of the center) (To no chujo), Kokiden no <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Nyogo (rank of court lady).html">nyogo</a>, was defeated by Itsuki no miya <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Nyogo (rank of court lady).html">nyogo</a> (later Akiyoshi <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Chugu.html">chugu</a>) in the competition to become the empress, and so he pinned his hope on his second daughter, Kumoi no kari and hoped to make her become the crown princess. When he learned of her relationship with <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Yugiri (The Tale of Genji).html">Yugiri</a>, however, he got very angry and moved her to his residence to separate them. Even after that, however, they continued to exchange letters. After he failed to enter her into court, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Naidaijin (inner minister).html">naidaijin</a> allowed Kumoi no kari to marry <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Yugiri (The Tale of Genji).html">Yugiri</a> ('<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Shojo.html">Shojo</a>' (girl) to 'Fuji no Uraba' (Wisteria Leaves)). </p>
<p>Kumoi no kari, who openly became kita no kata (the woman living in the north of the house; wife) of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Yugiri (The Tale of Genji).html">Yugiri</a> and gave birth to many children (The number of children differs by manuscripts, Akio ABE said that they had seven, while Kiyoshi FUJIMURA said eight was the number in the original version), had been spending her days having her mind quite at rest with her husband who was very earnest and faithful to her. Because of this domesticated life style which lacked elegance, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Yugiri (The Tale of Genji).html">Yugiri</a>'s affection gradually shifted toward <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Kashiwagi (The Tale of Genji).html">Kashiwagi</a>'s widow (that is, the sister-in-law of Kumoi no kari), <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Ochiba no miya.html">Ochiba no miya</a>. Upon learning of this, Kumoi no kari became very angry and returned to her parents home with her small children (From '<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Wakana (new herbs) (The Tale of Genji).html">Wakana</a>' to '<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Yugiri (The Tale of Genji).html">Yugiri</a>'). Finally, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Yugiri (The Tale of Genji).html">Yugiri</a> legitimately married <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Ochiba no miya.html">Ochiba no miya</a> and, after that, he visited the residence of Kumoi no kari and that of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Ochiba no miya.html">Ochiba no miya</a> alternately every other day ('Nioumiya'). Little information on her activities after that are given and the last scene with her is a description of her efforts to receive the love of her son, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Kurodo (Chamberlain).html">Kurodo</a> shosho in the volume '<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Takekawa (Bamboo River).html">Takekawa</a>' (literally, bamboo river). </p>
