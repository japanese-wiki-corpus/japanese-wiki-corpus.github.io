<h1>The Naniwa-zu (Waka [a traditional Japanese poem of 31 syllables] composed by Wani) (難波津 (和歌))</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The Naniwa-zu no uta (waka of Naniwa-zu Port) appears in the Kanajo (Japanese preface) of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kokin Wakashu (A Collection of Ancient and Modern Japanese Poetry).html">Kokin Wakashu</a> (Collection of Ancient and Modern Poems) as 'the poem written on the emperor of Osazaki' composed by Wani (Wang In). </p>
<p>After the death of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Ojin.html">Emperor Ojin</a>, Prince Uji no Waki-iratsuko and Osazaki no Mikoto (Prince Osazaki) tried to convince each other to ascend to the throne, but it lay vacant for three years. </p>
<p>In the end, Osazaki no Mikoto acceded to the throne and became <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Nintoku.html">Emperor Nintoku</a>, and this poem is said to have been composed at that time to pray for prosperity in his reign. </p>
<p>As the kanajo says of this poem, alongside the poem of Mt. Asaka, 'people who practice writing with a brush will start from this,' it was a poem traditionally used by those starting the study of calligraphy. In fact, together with a shusho <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Mokkan (Confiscation).html">mokkan</a> (a wooden tablet used for writing practice) unearthed from the ruins of Kannonji in Tokushima Prefecture, likely a product of the seventh century, and which had 'Naniwa-tsu ni Sakuya kono hana' (奈尓波ツ尓昨久矢己乃波奈, On the Beach of Naniwa, the flowers bloom) written upon it in Manyo-gana (a syllabary used in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Manyoshu (Collection of Ten Thousand Leaves).html">Manyoshu</a> [Collection of Ten Thousand Leaves]), many wooden tablets with this poem written on it have been unearthed from ruins all over the country. </p>
<p>In the Heian period, the 'Naniwa-zu no poem' was considered as the epitome of 'a poem which everyone knows.'<br/>
In <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Karuta.html">karuta</a> (Japanese playing cards) tournaments, people have a custom of intoning the Naniwa-zu no uta before starting the competition. </p>
<p>The flower here is regarded as ume (plum) blossoms, not as cherry blossoms. </p>
<p>Naniwa-zu ni/Sakuya Kono Hana Fuyu-gomori/Ima wa haru-be to/Sakuya kono hana (After lying dormant all winter, the blooming plum blossoms are blazoning now that the spring has come.)<br/>
