<h1>Danrin-ha (Danrin school of haiku) (談林派)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Danrin-ha was a shool of Haikai (seventeen-syllable verse) in the Edo period, which flourished under Soin NISHIYAMA. </p>
<p>It held a central place in haiku world, replacing the Teimon-ha (Teimon school of haiku) led by disciples of Teitoku MATSUNAGA. Soin NISHIYAMA, who also wrote Renga (linked verse), Saikaku IHARA, who also wrote Ukiyo Zoshi (stories of the floating world), Takamasa SUGANOYA of Kyo (Kyoto), Shoi TASHIRO of Edo and others actively participated. It later waned as Shofu (Basho style haiku) by Basho MATSUO became popular. </p>
<p>The Danrin-ha style was called "Kokorozuke" (meaning to give haiku a theoretical meaning). </p>
