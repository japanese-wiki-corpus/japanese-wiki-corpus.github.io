<h1>Nakatsukasa no Naishi Nikki (The Dairy of Nakatsukasa no Naishi) (中務内侍日記)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The Dairy of Nakatsukasa no Naishi is a work of courtly literature in the Kamakura period. </p>
<p>It was written in kana (the Japanese syllabary) by FUJIWARA no Keishi, known as Nakatsuka no Naishi who served Emperor Fushimi. </p>
<p>It describes her recollections about her courtly life over a period of 13 years, beginning with 1280 when the emperor was still crown prince and ending in 1292 when she retired due to her severe illness. </p>
<p>It comprises two volumes. Volume 1 includes her recollections from 1280 to 1286 during which Emperor Fushimi was still crown prince and Volume 2 recounts how she served the emperor. The Diary of Nakatsukasa no Naishi was quoted in Gunsho Ruiju (diaries compiled by subject-matter) as detailed sources on courtly customs and traditions, and was copied by scholars of Japanese literature. </p>
