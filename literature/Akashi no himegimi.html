<p><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Akashi (The Tale of Genji).html">Akashi</a> no himegimi (literally, princess of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Akashi (The Tale of Genji).html">Akashi</a>) is a character in "Genji <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Monogatari.html">Monogatari</a>" (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/The Tale of Genji.html">The Tale of Genji</a>), a novel written by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Murasaki Shikibu.html">Murasaki Shikibu</a>. As no particular name was given to her, she was referred to by various titles as she grew, such as "<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Akashi (The Tale of Genji).html">Akashi</a> no <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Nyogo (rank of court lady).html">nyogo</a>" (a high-ranking lady in the court (a consort of an emperor)), "<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Akashi (The Tale of Genji).html">Akashi</a> no <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Chugu.html">chugu</a>" (the second consort of an emperor) and so on, however, she was never referred to with a name prefixed by "<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Akashi (The Tale of Genji).html">Akashi</a> no" in the novel. She appears from the volume '<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Miotsukushi (The Tale of Genji).html">Miotsukushi</a>' (literally, channel buoys) to the volume '<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Tenarai.html">Tenarai</a>' (literally, writing practice) among 54 quires. </p>
<p>She was the only daughter of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Hikaru Genji.html">Hikaru Genji</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Akashi (The Tale of Genji).html">Akashi</a> no okata. According to the dream her grandfather, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Akashi (The Tale of Genji).html">Akashi</a> no nyudo, had, she was promised her destiny to become a kokumo (mother of the emperor) in the future. Because she was born from a mother of low birth, Genji took her in and gave her high-level education to become an empress as an adopted daughter of his de facto legitimate wife, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Murasaki no ue.html">Murasaki no ue</a>. Although <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Akashi (The Tale of Genji).html">Akashi</a> no himegimi knew that <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Murasaki no ue.html">Murasaki no ue</a> was not her real mother, she was still a very affectionate adoptive mother and brought up <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Akashi (The Tale of Genji).html">Akashi</a> no himegimi to be a beautiful young woman. </p>
<p>After her mogi (coming-of-age ceremony for girls), <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Akashi (The Tale of Genji).html">Akashi</a> no himegimi entered into court through marriage as the crown princess (in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Kiritsubo.html">Kiritsubo</a>'s palace). At that time, there was nobody who could compete with Genji's power and other nobles hesitated to have their daughters enter the palace as consorts because they had little chance of winning. In this regard, this is written in contrast with the case of Genji's real mother, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Kiritsubo.html">Kiritsubo</a> no koi (low class court lady). </p>
<p>After being referred to as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Nyogo (rank of court lady).html">Nyogo</a> (or <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Kiritsubo.html">Kiritsubo</a> no okata, miyasudokoro and so on), she stood highest in the favor of the crown prince and became pregnant (at the age of thirteen years old by the old Japanese system). Because the child was a boy (the first imperial prince), <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Akashi (The Tale of Genji).html">Akashi</a> no nyudo's wish was fulfilled and he resigned from the world and began living on a mountain. Having read Nyudo's letter after giving birth, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Nyogo (rank of court lady).html">nyogo</a> deeply recognized the sacrifice and affection of her grandfather and real mother for the first time and later grew to be a considerate lady. When the Crown Prince ascended the throne, the first prince became the crown prince (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Wakana (new herbs) (The Tale of Genji).html">Wakana</a> (New Herbs), Part Two) and she became a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Chugu.html">chugu</a> in the volume '<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Minori (The Rites).html">Minori</a>' (The Rites). When <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Murasaki no ue.html">Murasaki no ue</a> passed away, she attended her deathbed. </p>
<p>Similar to her paternal half-brother, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Yugiri (The Tale of Genji).html">Yugiri</a>, she was blessed with many children and gave birth to four sons and a daughter with the emperor. In Uji jujo (The Ten Quires of Uji), she loved the third prince, Nioumiya, tenderly together with the emperor, but she worried about his freewheeling behavior. At first, she was against the love between Nioumiya and Uji no nakagimi, but, when they gave birth to a son, she held ubuyashinai (a party to celebrate the birth of a baby) to celebrate it. She worried about the affair with <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Ukifune (The Tale of Genji).html">Ukifune</a> and, when she learned that <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Ukifune (The Tale of Genji).html">Ukifune</a> was alive, she informed <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Kaoru.html">Kaoru</a> while keeping it secret from Nioumiya. </p>
