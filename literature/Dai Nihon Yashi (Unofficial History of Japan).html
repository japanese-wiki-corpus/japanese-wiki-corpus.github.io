<h1>Dai Nihon Yashi (Unofficial History of Japan) (大日本野史)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Dai Nihon Yashi is a Japanese history book written in a style of biographical historiography, and covers the 21 Emperors' reigns from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Gokomatsu.html">Emperor Gokomatsu</a> (Meitoku era) to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Ninko.html">Emperor Ninko</a>. During the last days of the Tokugawa Shogunate, the book was written by Tadahiko IDA, who was a scholar of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Kokugaku.html">Kokugaku</a> (National Learning) from Tokuyama Domain and served the Arisugawa no Miya family later and it was completed in 1851. It consists of 291 volumes in total. Sometimes it is called 'Yashi' for short. </p>
<p>Because "Dai Nipponshi" (The History of Japan), a history book made by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Mitsukuni TOKUGAWA.html">Mitsukuni TOKUGAWA</a>, was finished with an account of unifying Japan in the period of the Northern and Southern Courts (in 1392), Ida planned to write a sequel to the book and spent more than thirty years in completing it. The original text was written in classical Chinese, but the manuscripts were dispersed and lost because Ida committed suicide protesting against being arrested on the suspicion of getting involved in the Sakuradamongai Incident, therefore his bereaved family published it in 1881 based on the book which Ida was asked to print after the completion of the book. </p>
<p>It is rich in biographies of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Busho.html">busho</a> (Japanese military commander) in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Sengoku Period (period of warring states) (Japan).html">Sengoku Period</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> (Japanese territorial lord). (Especially the articles about the Muromachi period is said to be more excellent than those about the Edo period, and above all the descriptions ranging from the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Onin War.html">Onin War</a> to the process of restructuring a feudal system were written well, because the author had to care about the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Edo bakufu.html">Edo bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>) during writing.)<br/>
However the book was written by Ida alone using limited number of historical materials; therefore Hiroyuki MIURA and Katsumi KUROITA pointed out that it lacked accuracy. </p>
