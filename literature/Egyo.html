<h1>Egyo (恵慶)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Egyo (the year of birth and death unknown) was a Japanese monk and a poet who lived during the mid-Heian period. He was also called Egyo <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Hoshi.html">Hoshi</a>. He is regarded as one of the medieval 36 Immortal Poets. </p>
<p>His place of origin and career are not known. He was an instructor of the Harima provincial monastery, and on his way to the monastery, he was sent a poem by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Jinzen.html">Jinzen</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Tendai-zasu.html">Tendai-zasu</a> (head priest of the Tendai sect). His poem was first collected in "Shui Wakashu" (Collection of Gleanings of Japanese Poems). Around 962, he began to join utaawase (poetry contest) and there is a record which says that he attended with Emperor Kazan in his travel to Kumano in 986.
