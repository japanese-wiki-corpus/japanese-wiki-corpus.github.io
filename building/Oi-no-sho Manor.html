<h1>Oi-no-sho Manor (大井荘)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Oi-no-sho Manor was a shoen (manor in medieval Japan) existed in Mino Province during Nara and Muromachi Periods. It was an estate of Todai-ji Temple. </p>
<p><h3>Location</h3>
</p>
<p>Anpachi District, Mino Province,<br/>
The vicinity of modern-day Ogaki City, Gifu Prefecture. <h3>Size</h3>
</p>
<p>About 517.22ha as of the late 10th century. </p>
<p>Origin<br/>
</p>
<p>In 756, Emperor Shomu presented the manor to Todai-ji Temple. </p>
<p>During the Kenmu era, the divided guardian deity of Todai-ji Temple, Tamukaiyama Hachimangu Shrine, was transferred to the manor (present Ogaki Hachiman-jinja Shrine). <h3>Feudal Lord</h3>
</p>
<p>Todai-ji Temple<br/>
The actual ruler was the Onakatomi clan, a descendent of kaihatsu ryoshu (local notables who actually developed the land) ONAKATOMI no Nobukiyo, but the clan collapsed due to an internal conflict during the Kamakura period. <h3>Demise</h3>
</p>
<p>It is possible that the manor declined under the dominance of the Toki clan who served as Mino no Kuni Shugo (provincial constable of Mino Province),<br/>
<h3>Note</h3>
</p>
<p>Like Atsumi-no-so Manor, it also paid its nengu (land tax) in silk. </p>
