<h1>Sumitomo Kakkien (住友活機園)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Sumitomo Kakkien is a historical building located in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Otsu City.html">Otsu City</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Shiga Prefecture.html">Shiga Prefecture</a>. The structure is a representative mansion of the late <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period and, the retirement residence of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Teigo IBA.html">Teigo IBA</a>, the 2nd hereditary President of the Sumitomo <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Zaibatsu (a financial clique or group, or a company syndicate).html">zaibatsu</a> (pre WWII business conglomerate). Sumitomo Kakkien is located at 10-4 Tanabe-cho, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Otsu City.html">Otsu City</a>. </p>
<p><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Teigo IBA.html">Teigo IBA</a> retired here in 1904 and passed away here in 1926. The meaning of the Japanese kanji used for the 'Kakki' part of 'Kakkien' is 'even in a life <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Apart (Apartment).html">apart</a> from the real world, we know the subtleties of human nature'. Consisting of Western-style house, Japanese-style house, and gardens, 6 buildings and grounds of Kakkien were designated Important Cultural Property in 2002 by virtue that 'it is a rare example that completely conveys the style of a late-Meiji era mansion'. The property is owned by Sumitomo Forestry and managed by Sumitomo Realty. Various companies within the Sumitomo Group contribute to operation and maintenance costs. </p>
