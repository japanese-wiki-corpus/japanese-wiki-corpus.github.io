<h1>Sukiya-zukuri (数寄屋造り)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Sukiya-zukuri is one of the Japanese architectural styles, and is characterized as a design of residential house in a sukiya (teahouse) style. </p>
<p>Its name comes from 'suki' which means enjoying <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Furyu.html">furyu</a> (elegant aestheticism), such as waka (31 syllable Japanese poem), tea ceremony, and Japanese flower arrangement (refer to sukimono), and 'sukiya' means 'a house built as you like,' or a teahouse. </p>
<p>It is a house built by sukiya carpenters (refer to Daiku (carpenters)) using a specific method of timber-framework. </p>
<p><h3>History</h3>
</p>
<p><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Teahouses.html">Teahouses</a> called sukiya first appeared in the Azuchi-Momoyama Period. Originally a sukiya was a small stand-alone teahouse (at most 4 and a half tatami mats in size) built facing a garden. At that time, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Shoin-zukuri.html">shoin-zukuri</a>, containing an impressive room furnished with an alcove, shelf, and tsukeshoin (a built-in table) were already established, with its role in maintaining hierarchy and status, but masters of ceremonial tea disliked formal designs and gorgeous decoration. They liked sukiya which were built in a light and easy style. </p>
<p>In the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Edo Period.html">Edo Period</a> the sukiya style spread from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Teahouses.html">teahouses</a> to residential houses. Today, many houses and fancy Japanese-style restaurants are modeled after sukiya architecture. </p>
<p>Experts of architectural history call it 'sukiya style <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Shoin (the Tendai sect).html">shoin</a>,' considering it not as an original style but rather as a kind of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Shoin-zukuri.html">shoin-zukuri</a>. </p>
<p>Design unique to sukiya-zukuri:<br/>
Sukiya architecture is characterized by complete elimination of the status and style that <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Shoin (the Tendai sect).html">shoin</a> architecture put emphasis on. Its design is simple and sophisticated, reflecting the spirit of a tea master in rejecting superficial decoration and stressing internal self improvement to entertain guests. 
<br/>The following are features of sukiya-zukuri:<br/>
</p>
<p>The omission of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Nageshi (a horizontal piece of timber).html">nageshi</a> (a horizontal piece of timber in a frame):<br/>
Menkawabashira (bark surfaces) with round surfaces are used, usually in place of these <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Nageshi (a horizontal piece of timber).html">nageshi</a>. </p>
<p>Alcove:<br/>
The alcove in a sukiya is small and simple compared with that of a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Shoin-zukuri.html">shoin-zukuri</a>. </p>
<p>Deep eaves:<br/>
The eaves are wide, creating shadows and a feeling of peacefulness inside the room. <h3>Typical remains of sukiya-zukuri:</h3>

<p>Junichiro TANIZAKI loved sukiya. His own house was of sukiya style, and he extolled the beauty of sukiya in his essay "Ineiraisan." </p>
