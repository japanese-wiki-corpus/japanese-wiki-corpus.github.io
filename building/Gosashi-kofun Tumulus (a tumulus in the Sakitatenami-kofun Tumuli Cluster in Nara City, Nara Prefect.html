<h1>Gosashi-kofun Tumulus (a tumulus in the Sakitatenami-kofun Tumuli Cluster in Nara City, Nara Prefecture) (五社神古墳)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Gosashi-kofun Tumulus is an ancient tomb belonging to the Sakitatenami-kofun Tumuli Cluster in Nara City, Nara Prefecture. It is recorded as 'Sakitatanamiike no e no Misasagi' in the list of Shoryoryo (the Bureau for managing imperial mausoleums) in "Engishiki" (an ancient book for codes and procedures on national rites and prayers), and the Imperial Household Agency analogically considers it as present Empress Jingu Mausoleum. It is a tumulus thought to have been built for a woman. At the end of Edo period, the extension of the shugo (surrounding moat) under the Bunkyu Restoration of Imperial Mausoleums was verified. </p>
<p>In 2004 it was opened to 15 academic societies and associations. </p>
<p>In 2008 the Imperial Household Agency for the first time permitted the request of 16 academic societies and associations fronted by the Japanese Archaeological Association to enter the mausoleum for research, which was conducted on February 22 of the same year by 16 people. A row of cylindrical haniwa (clay figure) which had not been known before were found in their original position at the mound hem and outside of the east side of the front square part. </p>
