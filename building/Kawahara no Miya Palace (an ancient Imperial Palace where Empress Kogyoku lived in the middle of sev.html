<h1>Kawahara no Miya Palace (an ancient Imperial Palace where <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Empress Kogyoku..html">Empress Kogyoku</a> lived in the middle of seventh century) (川原宮)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kawahara no Miya was a palace where <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Empress Kogyoku..html">Empress Kogyoku</a> lived in the middle of the seventh century. It is generally called <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Asuka (飛鳥 in Chinese characters, the name of present-day Asuka Village, Nara Prefecture).html">Asuka</a> no Kawahara no Miya. It was reportedly located at the place of Gufuku-ji Temple (also known as Kawahara-dera Temple) now existing in Kawahara, Asuka Village, Nara Prefecture. </p>
<p><h3>Details</h3>
</p>
<p><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan).html">Nihonshoki</a> (Chronicles of Japan) describes that since Itabuki no Miya Palace was destroyed by fire in winter in 655, Empress Saimei moved into Kawahara no Miya Palace. In the following year (656), she built Okamoto no Miya Palace to move in, so Kawahara no Miya Palace is considered to have been her temporary Palace. <h3>Later development</h3>
</p>
<p>After the death of Empress Saimei, Kawahara no Miya Palace is deemed to have been changed to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Kawara-dera Temple.html">Kawara-dera Temple</a> in the era of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Tenchi (Tenji).html">Emperor Tenchi</a>, a child of Empress Saimei. In the early Heian period, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Saga.html">Emperor Saga</a> is said to have given the temple to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Kukai.html">Kukai</a>. At the present time, the temple calls itself Gufuku-ji Temple on Mt. Buddha belonging to Shingonshu sect. </p>
