<h1>Kameoka Sports Park (亀岡運動公園)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kameoka Sports Park is a park in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kameoka City.html">Kameoka City</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a> that has a sports complex. </p>
<p>Probably because Kameoka-City is located near the center of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>, many city as well as prefecture-hosted athletic competitions are held here. </p>
<p>Kameoka Sports Park is a sports complex that was built for the Kyoto National Sports Festival held in 1988, consisting of gymnasiums, an athletics stadium, a baseball field, swimming pools, tennis courts, and various types of play equipment, and is used by a large number of visitors not only from Kameoka-City but also from outside <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>. </p>
<p>Within the facilities, based on the features of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kameoka City.html">Kameoka City</a>'s overseas sister cities, the park has a cute small building modeled after a Western castle, a pond with waterfowl, a large and heavy bell donated by Suzhou City in China, a Japanese dry landscape garden and so on, all of which are popular with the city's residents. </p>
<p>Also, the Cosmos Garden opens every fall near the park, and countless beautiful Mexican asters in a wide variety of colors entertain the garden visitors. </p>
