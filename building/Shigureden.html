<h1>Shigureden (時雨殿)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Located in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Sakyo Ward.html">Sakyo Ward</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>, Shigureden is a facility for the promotion and exhibition of the Ogura <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Hyakunin Isshu.html">Hyakunin Isshu</a> (the Ogura Anthology of 100 Poems by 100 Poets). <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/The Ogura Hyakunin Isshu Cultural Foundation.html">The Ogura Hyakunin Isshu Cultural Foundation</a> established and operates Shigureden, which is close to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Togetsu-kyo Bridge.html">Togetsu-kyo Bridge</a> at the foot of Mt. Ogura where <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Sadaie.html">FUJIWARA no Sadaie</a> compiled the anthology. It was opened on January 27, 2006. It is more of a theme park than a museum about the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Hyakunin Isshu.html">Hyakunin Isshu</a>, because doesn't exhibit much of the history of the collection or have an explanation of its card game. </p>
<p><h3>Summary of facilities</h3>
</p>
<p>One can experience the world of the new <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Hyakunin Isshu.html">Hyakunin Isshu</a> by using hi-tech digital imaging machines and portable consoles. Among them, aerial photographs of both <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a> and the card game are displayed on 'Nintendo Floor Vision' which consists of 70 full-spec 45-inch High Definition Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) panels made by Sharp Corp., and arranged on the floor. There is also a hands-on exhibition of 'Taikan Karuta Goban-shobu' (five games of virtual reality Karuta Card), with which you can enjoy virtual Karuta Card games with 'poets' that are displayed on a 65-inch LCD. </p>
<p>Hiroshi YAMAUCHI, president of the foundation and executive adviser to Nintendo, personally bore the construction costs, and Shigeru MIYAMOTO, executive director of Nintendo, runs it with technological support from Nintendo. </p>
<p>Its first floor is for hands-on exhibitions; the second floor exhibits written materials and has a large room for <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Karuta.html">Karuta</a> game competitions. Please note that visitors are required to take their shoes off at the entrance, and walk around with socks or stockings on, and without slippers. </p>
<p>The <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Karuta.html">Karuta</a> game mentioned earlier uses a touch-panel operated portable console 'Shigureden Navi' which is made out of a Nintendo DS with its buttons removed. </p>
<p>Because there are digital communications facilities such as Floor Vision and wireless transmissions with portable consoles, a notice is posted on the first floor advising "We must decline admission to pacemaker users." <h3>Location</h3>
