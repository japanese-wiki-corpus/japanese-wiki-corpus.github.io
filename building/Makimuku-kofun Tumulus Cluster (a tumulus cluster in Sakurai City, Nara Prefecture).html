<h1>Makimuku-kofun Tumulus Cluster (a tumulus cluster in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Sakurai City.html">Sakurai City</a>, Nara Prefecture) (纏向古墳群)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Makimuku-kofun Tumulus Cluster is located in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Sakurai City.html">Sakurai City</a>, Nara Prefecture. The tumulus cluster was made at the beginning of the first half of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kofun period (tumulus period).html">Kofun period</a> (tumulus period). </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>This tumulus cluster is located in the south of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Yanagimoto-kofun Tumulus Cluster (a Tumulus Cluster in Yanagimoto Town, Tenri City).html">Yanagimoto-kofun Tumulus Cluster</a> and spread over the west foot of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Mt. Miwa (a cone-shaped gentle mountain in Sakurai City, Nara Prefecture).html">Mt. Miwa</a>. Above all, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Hashihaka-kofun Tumulus.html">Hashihaka-kofun Tumulus</a> (also known as Hashinakayama-kofun Tumulus) is the first stereotyped large keyhole-shaped mound. </p>
<p>It is estimated to have been constructed approximately in the middle of the third century. The <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kofun period (tumulus period).html">Kofun period</a> is said to have begun at that time. </p>
<p>Furthermore, it is supposed to be the tomb of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Himiko.html">Himiko</a> (first known ruler of Japan), the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Queen (of imperial family).html">queen</a> of Yamatai-Koku kingdom described in "Gishi" Wajinden (an 'Account of the Wa [inhabitants of the western Japanese archipelago in the late third century]' in "The History of the Wei Dynasty" which comprises "The History of the Three Kingdoms" written by Chen Shou, where the account is known as the first historical record of Japan). The <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Imperial Household Agency.html">Imperial Household Agency</a> manages it as the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Mausoleum.html">Mausoleum</a> of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Yamatototohimomosohime no mikoto.html">Yamatototohimomosohime no mikoto</a> (Princess Yamatototohimomosohime) at Oichi. <h3>Characteristics of the tumuli</h3>
</p>
<p>The tumuli at the Makimuku ruin are referred to as Makimuku style of a large keyhole-shaped mound. There are many scallop-shaped mounds in the cluster. 
<br/>They have the following characteristics:<br/>
</p>
<p>Compared with the back circular part, the front square part is remarkably small, low and flat. </p>
<p>The ratio of the whole length of the tumuli, the diameter of the back circular part to the length of the front square part is exactly three, two to one in principle. </p>
<p>The form of the back circular part is not an accurate circle, but an oblate spheroid, an obovoid shape, or an inaccurate circle. </p>
<p>The front square part of a tumulus surrounded with a moat is narrow. <h3>Main tumuli</h3>
