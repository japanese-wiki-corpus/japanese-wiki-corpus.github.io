<h1>Kasamatsu-koen Park (傘松公園)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kasamatsu-koen Park is located in Miyazu City, Kyoto Prefecture. It is provided with a facility for viewing Amanohashidate (a beauty spot: A long narrow land protruding into the sea). This park has become a sightseeing spot. It can be reached from the foot of the mountain, where the park is located, with a cable-car or a cable-lifted chair. </p>
<p>Summary of the View<br/>
When viewed from Kasamatsu-koen Park, Amanohashidate looks like 'Naname Ichimonji' (a slanting Chinese character of '一' (ichi, literally, one)). Here, it is possible to enjoy famous Matanozoki viewing (to view Amanohashidate from between your two legs). Viewed in the Matanozoki way, the sky and the earth look upside down, making Amanohashidate look just like a bridge across the sky. This park is located on a mountain. However, when the mountain is climbed further for three minutes, there is the birth place of "Matanozoki" where a pine named 'Kasamatsu' (literally, an umbrella pine) stands. Buses for Nariai-ji Temple, the 28th temple of the 33 Temples of Kansai Kannon Pilgrimage, depart from here as well. </p>
