<h1>Kasamatsu-koen Park (傘松公園)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kasamatsu-koen Park is located in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Miyazu City.html">Miyazu City</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>. It is provided with a facility for viewing <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Amanohashidate.html">Amanohashidate</a> (a beauty spot: A long narrow land protruding into the sea). This park has become a sightseeing spot. It can be reached from the foot of the mountain, where the park is located, with a cable-car or a cable-lifted chair. </p>
<p>Summary of the View<br/>
When viewed from Kasamatsu-koen Park, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Amanohashidate.html">Amanohashidate</a> looks like 'Naname Ichimonji' (a slanting Chinese character of '一' (ichi, literally, one)). Here, it is possible to enjoy famous Matanozoki viewing (to view <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Amanohashidate.html">Amanohashidate</a> from between your two legs). Viewed in the Matanozoki way, the sky and the earth look upside down, making <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Amanohashidate.html">Amanohashidate</a> look just like a bridge across the sky. This park is located on a mountain. However, when the mountain is climbed further for three minutes, there is the birth place of "Matanozoki" where a pine named 'Kasamatsu' (literally, an umbrella pine) stands. Buses for <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Nariai-ji Temple.html">Nariai-ji Temple</a>, the 28th temple of the 33 Temples of Kansai Kannon <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Pilgrimage.html">Pilgrimage</a>, depart from here as well. </p>
