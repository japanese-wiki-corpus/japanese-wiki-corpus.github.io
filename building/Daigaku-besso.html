<p>Daigaku-besso were facilities affiliated to the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Daigaku-ryo.html">Daigaku-ryo</a> (the government facility established in the eighth century to educate students who were to become bureaucrats). However, they were operated by their founder families, and not controlled by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Daigaku-ryo.html">Daigaku-ryo</a>. </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>Students of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Daigaku-ryo.html">Daigaku-ryo</a> lived in a dormitory called 'Jikiso' inside the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Daigaku-ryo.html">Daigaku-ryo</a> as a general rule (although living in Jikiso was not imperative, the fact that there was a code of living for the students of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Daigaku-ryo.html">Daigaku-ryo</a> implies it had a policy to control student life, which would be connected to the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Jogan-shiki Code.html">Jogan-shiki Code</a> that will be mentioned later). In the Heian period, the Sugawara clan who succeeded to the position of Monjo-hakase (professor at the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Daigaku-ryo.html">Daigaku-ryo</a>) for many generations established the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Monjoin.html">Monjoin</a> as the Jikiso (it is also said to have been an expanded old one). Later, as the position of the Monjo-hakase rose in status, and the Sugawara clan continued to succeed to the role, the Sugawara clan's dominance over the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Monjoin.html">Monjoin</a> and its students became even more stronger. Reacting against this situation, other powerful clans built their own dormitories outside the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Daigaku-ryo.html">Daigaku-ryo</a> one after the other. These dormitories were called Daigaku-besso to distinguish them from the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Monjoin.html">Monjoin</a> which was a Jikiso of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Daigaku-ryo.html">Daigaku-ryo</a>. At first, the Imperial court thought this situation was unfair to the students, so it inserted the statement that 'no student who lives outside the dormitory of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Daigaku-ryo.html">Daigaku-ryo</a> can be recommended to be an officer' into the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Jogan-shiki Code.html">Jogan-shiki Code</a> (a book of laws and regulations compiled in the Jogan Era). The <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Kangakuin.html">Kangakuin</a> of the Fujiwara clan is thought to have gained the Imperial court's approval as a Daigaku-besso because <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/FUJIWARA no Yoshifusa.html">FUJIWARA no Yoshifusa</a> and other members of the Fujiwara clan fought back against the setback. </p>
<p>Only the students of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Daigaku-ryo.html">Daigaku-ryo</a> (or students preparing for entrance to it) were allowed to live in a Daigaku-besso which was a dormitory equipped with a library and a room to study, and the students had to attend the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Daigaku-ryo.html">Daigaku-ryo</a> to take classes and examinations. Although later, in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period, the remark that Daigaku-besso were 'private schools' was published in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yasutsugu SHIGENO.html">Yasutsugu SHIGENO</a>'s 'Honpo Korai Kyoiku no Taigai' (Overview of the Education of Ancient Japan), this is not borne out by the facts, because there is no record that Daigaku-besso had specialist teachers to give lectures, and at that time there were kinds of 'shijuku' (private tutoring schools at teachers' homes) that corresponded to private schools, where teachers in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Daigaku-ryo.html">Daigaku-ryo</a> or reputed scholars provided lectures (example: Kanke Roka School of the Sugawara clan). </p>
<p>The uji no <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Choja.html">choja</a> (the head of the clan) or the Zejo (the title of the chieftain of a clan especially the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/family/Tachibana clan.html">Tachibana clan</a>) of each clan managed its Daigaku-besso which was neither an official dormitory nor controlled by the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Daigaku-ryo.html">Daigaku-ryo</a>, but later their students were given a special privilege (called 'Nenkyo') to take a bureaucratic post without sitting for <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Appointment (Ninkan).html">appointment</a> examinations for <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shoen.html">Shoen</a> (manors) or the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Daigaku-ryo.html">Daigaku-ryo</a>. Over time Daigaku-besso declined to such an extent that they became only a form as the power of other clans decreased, with the exception of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Kangakuin.html">Kangakuin</a> of the Fujiwara clan. Although most Daigaku-besso (including <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Shogakuin.html">Shogakuin</a>) became merely titles, during Inseiki (the period of the cloister government), a title 'Junnain Shogakuin Ryoin Betto' (the principal of both Junnain and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Shogakuin.html">Shogakuin</a>) was created along with the Junnain, the Goin (palace of the retired Emperor) of the retired <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Junna.html">Emperor Junna</a>, as a post for successive Genji <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Choja.html">Choja</a> (chiefs of the Minamoto clan), and this title later became one of the titles of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> families, such as Ashikaga <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> and Tokugawa <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a>. <h3>List of Daigaku-besso</h3>
