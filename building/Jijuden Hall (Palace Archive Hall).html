<h1>Jijuden Hall (Palace Archive Hall) (仁寿殿)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Jijuden Hall (or Jinjuden Hall) was one of the halls of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Dairi (the Imperial palace).html">dairi</a> (Imperial Palace) in the city of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Heian-kyo.html">Heian-kyo</a>. </p>
<p>Situated almost at the center of the Imperial Palace, this hall was located north of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Shishinden Hall (Hall for state ceremonies).html">Shishinden Hall</a> (Throne Hall), south of the Shokyoden Hall and east of the Seiryoden Hall. </p>
<p>In the early Heian period, this building was used as the everyday living quarters of emperor. It is for this reason that Jijuden Hall also had an ishibai-no-dan (lime <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Altar.html">altar</a>) at which the emperor would pray in the direction of Ise-jingu and other shrines each morning. </p>
<p>After the emperor's residence was moved to Seiryoden Hall, Jijuden Hall was used for various events including <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Sumai no Sechie.html">Sumai no Sechie</a> (the Imperial ceremony of Sumo wrestling), naien (private dinners) and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Genpuku (celebrate ones coming of age).html">genpuku</a> (male coming-of-age ceremonies). </p>
