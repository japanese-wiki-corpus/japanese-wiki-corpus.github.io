<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>Location: Otsuka, Yanagimoto-cho,Tenri City<br/>
</p>
<p>Buried person: Unknown<br/>
</p>
<p>Time of construction: The First half of the early Kofun period (Tumulus period). </p>
<p>Tomb shape: A large keyhole-shaped mound. The back circular part is not precise circle shaped. The front of the front square part is an arch which gets narrower instead of extending like a plectrum. A surrounding moat is unverified in the west tomb hill. </p>
<p>Size: Approximately 94 meters in total length. The back circular part is 54 meters in diameter. </p>
<p>The burial facilities: The main chamber, a pit stone chamber (approximately 3.6 meters in length and approximately 3.6 meters in width) along the north-south axis in the center of the back circular part mound, and a hollowed-out wooden ship-shaped coffin (approximately 2 meters in length and approximately 1.2 meters in width), from which copper arrowheads and iron vessels were found. A small irregular circle shaped stone chamber 1 meter in diameter was set up where Ogata bosei naiko kamon-kyo (a large bronze mirror manufactured in Japan with patterns like a flower-petal) with 39.7 centimeters in diameter was placed. This small stone chamber is a gassho-style (an architect method of beams combined to form a steep roof that resembles two hands together) stone chamber with flagstones jutting into the ceiling, which may have been a subsidiary chamber to put in grave goods. </p>
