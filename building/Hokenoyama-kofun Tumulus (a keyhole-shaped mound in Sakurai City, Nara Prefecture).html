<h1>Hokenoyama-kofun Tumulus (a keyhole-shaped mound in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Sakurai City.html">Sakurai City</a>, Nara Prefecture) (ホケノ山古墳)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The Hokenoyama-kofun Tumulus is a so-called Makimuku type escallop-shaped, large keyhole-shaped mound in the early first half of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Kofun period (tumulus period).html">Kofun period</a> (Tumulus period), located in Aza Hokenoyama, Oaza Hashinaka, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Sakurai City.html">Sakurai City</a>, Nara Prefecture. </p>
<p>On January 26, 2006, it was designated as a national historic site. At present restoration and preparation work being over, it is open to the public. </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>Location: At the west foot of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Mt. Miwa (a cone-shaped gentle mountain in Sakurai City, Nara Prefecture).html">Mt. Miwa</a>, in the east of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/building/Hashihaka-kofun Tumulus.html">Hashihaka-kofun Tumulus</a><br/>
Buried person: Unknown (Omiwa-jinja Shrine takes it as Toyosuki iribime no mikoto's tomb). Time of construction: Judging from grave goods and burial facilities, it is thought to be a large keyhole-shaped mound in the period dating back some years to the period in which stylized large keyhole-shaped mounds typified by the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/building/Hashihaka-kofun Tumulus.html">Hashihaka-kofun Tumulus</a> appeared, and therefore it is presumed to have been built in the era of Yamatai-Koku kingdom. There are two views about the tomb; one is that it is a keyhole-shaped Yayoi mound tomb and the other a tomb in the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Kofun period (tumulus period).html">Kofun period</a>. </p>
<p>Tomb shape: A Makimuku type keyhole-shaped mound (some fukiishi [a layer of stone covering the soil over a burial mound] found), with a short front square part attached to the circular part. </p>
<p>Size: It is approximately 80 meters in full length, with the three tiered back circular part approximately 55 meters in diameter, and with a <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a> (surrounding moat) approximately 10.5 to 17.5 meters in width. Excavation investigation: Started by the Kashihara Archaeological Institute, Nara Prefecture and the Sakurai City Board of Education from September, 1999. </p>
<p>Location<br/>
</p>
<p>Burial facilities<br/>
</p>
<p>A 'stone-fenced mokkaku' (wooden burial chamber) was found in the center top of the tomb. In the inside of a large doko (dug-out hole) there was a stone chamber-like facility approximately 7 meters in length and approximately 2.7 meters in width. There was a large size mokkaku in which 5 meters hollowed-out coffin made of Japanese umbrella pine was placed inside it. Split bamboo-shape mokkaku in a broad sense. The ceiling was made of lumber, on which local riverbed stones were piled up. It seems to have been covered with cinnabar mercury. </p>
<p>A part of hem fukiishi in the front square part was removed and a wooden coffin was buried. One simple burial facility in the constricted spot. </p>
<p>A corridor-style stone chamber (around the end of sixth century on the west side of the main body the burial was done using the mound)<br/>
The stone chamber is more than 14 meters in full length. In the burial chamber there is a sectional house-shaped stone chamber. <h3>Grave goods and unearthed goods</h3>
</p>
<p>Large size jars (Setouchi type, 77 centimeters in height, 65 centimeters in maximum diameter)<br/>
Middle size jars (Tokai style, 26 centimeters in height, 24 centimeters in maximum diameter)<br/>
