<h1>Maizuru Crane Bridge (舞鶴クレインブリッジ)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Located in Maizuru City, Kyoto Prefecture, Maizuru Crane Bridge is the largest cable-stayed bridge on the coast of the Sea of Japan. </p>
<p>Maizuru Crane Bridge, measuring 735 meters in length and about 95 meters in height measured from the level of the water, is a white cable-stayed bridge over Maizuru Taira Bay, a repatriation base after the Second World War. It was designed to represent the form of two cranes; the main tower signifies the beak of a crane, and the cables its wings. </p>
<p>Although it is often referred to as scenic in itself, the completion of this bridge has also provided residents of the Oura district of Maizuru City with significantly improved access to the city area. </p>
