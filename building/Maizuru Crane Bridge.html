<h1>Maizuru Crane Bridge (舞鶴クレインブリッジ)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Located in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Maizuru City.html">Maizuru City</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>, Maizuru Crane Bridge is the largest cable-stayed bridge on the coast of the Sea of Japan. </p>
<p>Maizuru Crane Bridge, measuring 735 meters in length and about 95 meters in height measured from the level of the water, is a white cable-stayed bridge over Maizuru Taira Bay, a repatriation base after the Second World War. It was designed to represent the form of two cranes; the main tower signifies the beak of a crane, and the cables its wings. </p>
<p>Although it is often referred to as scenic in itself, the completion of this bridge has also provided residents of the Oura district of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Maizuru City.html">Maizuru City</a> with significantly improved access to the city area. </p>
<p><h3>Access</h3>
</p>
<p>It is approximately 20 minutes by car from Maizuru-Higashi Interchange on the Maizuru-Wakasa Expressway. <h3>Scenic spots, cultural facilities, and events nearby</h3>
