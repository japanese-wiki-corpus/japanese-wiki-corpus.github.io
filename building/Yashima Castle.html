<h1>Yashima Castle (屋嶋城)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The Yashima-no-ki castle or <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Yashima (Noh play).html">Yashima</a> castle is an ancient mountain castle once existed in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Yashima (Noh play).html">Yashima</a>, the Sanuki Province (present <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Yashima (Noh play).html">Yashima</a>, Takamatsu City, Kagawa Prefecture). </p>
<p>Summary<br/>
It was built in an ancient time, and it is recorded in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan).html">Nihonshoki</a> (Chronicles of Japan) that <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Tenchi (Tenji).html">Emperor Tenchi</a> built a castle in 667 to prepare an invasion by Tang's forces. </p>
<p>Even today, remains of a gate of the castle (in the southern peak area), stone mounds (on the west slope of the northern peak), and remains of a water reservoir still exist there. In addition, Yashima-dera Temple, said having been built by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Ganjin (Jianzhen).html">Ganjin</a> (Jianzhen) in the eighth century, is located in the southern peak area. </p>
<p>The board of education in Takamatsu City excavated remains of the castle gate in 2001, making it clear that the castle once existed actually. </p>
