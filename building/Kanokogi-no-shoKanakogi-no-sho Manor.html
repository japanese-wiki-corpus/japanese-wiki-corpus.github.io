<h1>Kanokogi-no-sho/Kanakogi-no-sho Manor (鹿子木荘)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kanokogi-no-sho/Kanakogi-no-sho was a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> (manor in medieval Japan) that existed in Higo Province during the Heian and Muromachi Periods. It was an estate of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/To-ji Temple.html">To-ji Temple</a>. </p>

</p>
<p>Origin<br/>
</p>
<p>It is thought that the manor was developed by Shami Jumyo before being donated by his grandson Takakata KANOKOGI/KANAKOGI (鹿子木高方) to dazai daini (senior assistant governor-general of Government Headquarters in Kyushu) <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Sanemasa.html">FUJIWARA no Sanemasa</a> in 1086, and after Sanemasa's downfall, was inherited by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/FUJIWARA no Kinzane.html">FUJIWARA no Kinzane</a>, but his grandson FUJIWARA no Takamichi (a son of Kinzane's daughter) later donated it to Shokudoku-in Temple and subsequently <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Ninna-ji Temple.html">Ninna-ji Temple</a> took on the role of head family. <h3>Feudal Lord</h3>

</p>
<p>The area lost its status as a manor in the Muromachi period after the Takuma clan which had descended from the Kanokogi/Kanakogi clan and served as jito (manager and lord of manor) expanded its power during the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period. </p>
