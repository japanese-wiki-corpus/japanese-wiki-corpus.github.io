<p>Origin<br/>
</p>
<p>It is thought that the manor was developed by Shami Jumyo before being donated by his grandson Takakata KANOKOGI/KANAKOGI (鹿子木高方) to dazai daini (senior assistant governor-general of Government Headquarters in Kyushu) FUJIWARA no Sanemasa in 1086, and after Sanemasa's downfall, was inherited by FUJIWARA no Kinzane, but his grandson FUJIWARA no Takamichi (a son of Kinzane's daughter) later donated it to Shokudoku-in Temple and subsequently Ninna-ji Temple took on the role of head family. <h3>Feudal Lord</h3>
