<h1>Genson Tenshu (The Existing Castle Towers) (現存天守)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The existing castle towers are those, among castle towers of Japanese castles built during the feudal period from around the beginning of Edo period to the late Edo Period, that have been preserved to date. In addition to the existing castle towers (tenshu), there are restored tenshu, reconstructed tenshu, and imitation tenshu. </p>
<p>Summary<br/>
It does not necessarily mean that the existing castle towers are the original buildings that have been preserved from the time when they were first built. Some existing castle towers (including that of Himeji-jo Castle and Hikone-jo Castle) have gone through repeated renovations to maintain their near-original splendors, whereas other ones (including that of Inuyama-jo Castle, Matsumoto-jo Castle, Kochi-jo Castle, Maruoka-jo Castle, and Matsue-jo Castle) that were rebuilt while their respective castles existed have remained virtually intact through today. Additionally, there is an existing castle tower (of Uwajima-jo Castle) where a part of the building housing the castle tower was destroyed by fire and rebuilt. Other existing castle towers include those (of various castles such as Matsuyama-jo Castle (Bicchu Province), Matsuyama-jo Castle (Iyo Province), Hirosaki-jo Castle, and Marukame-jo Castle) where only the castle towers have been preserved as the main buildings housing the respective castle towers were removed or lost prior to the time when their preservation was decided after the Meiji Restoration. The last group in the foregoing includes the castle tower that was referred to as Gosankai Yagura (Three-storied turret) when the castle was standing. There was an instance where Yasuhiro NISHIGAYA positioned the Uto-yagura turret of Kumamoto-jo Castle and the Daidokoro-yagura turret and Koran-yagura turret of Ozu-jo Castle as sho-tenshu (small keeps), thereby designating these turrets the existing castle towers. </p>
<p><h3>Details</h3>
</p>
<p>Castle towers, the symbolic representation of the respective castles, are said to have been brought into existence by Nobunaga ODA, and reached the peak of their popularity around the Battle of Sekigahara, but as the number of castles decreased with implementation of the Ikkoku Ichijo Rei (Law of One Castle per Province) by the Edo bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun), a ban was also imposed on construction of new castles and extension and reconstruction of the existing castles according to Buke shohatto(Acts for the Military Houses). Additionally, since some castle towers (including those of Edo-jo Castle and Osaka-jo Castle) that had been burnt down or destroyed by disasters and the like during the Edo Period were not subsequently rebuilt, the number of castle towers fell. Additional castle towers were lost due to various circumstances such as wars that broke out between the end of the Edo bakufu and the beginning of the Meiji era, the removal of castles according to the ordinance by the Meiji Government to abolish castles, and war damages that occurred during the Second World War. </p>
<p>Up to around 1945, there were castle towers at 20 castles, including 8 castles (Matsumae-jo Castle, Mito-jo Castle, Ogaki-jo Castle, Nagoya-jo Castle, Wakayama-jo Castle, Okayama-jo Castle, Fukuyama-jo Castle (Bingo Province), and Hiroshima-jo Castle) that were destroyed by war damage during the Second World War or accidental fires after that war. These 8 castles had been designated cultural properties such as National Treasures in accordance with the Law for the Preservation of National Treasures but, today, only 12 castles have existing castle towers that are available for viewing as Cultural Properties. The castle towers that remain at these 12 locations as mentioned above are collectively referred to as the existing 12 castle towers. These 12 existing castle towers will be discussed below. <h3>The 12 Existing Castle Towers</h3>
</p>
<p>The 12 Castles with Existing Castle Towers<br/>
As mentioned earlier, of the 20 existing castle towers, 8 were burnt down during and after the Second World War in the Showa period, whereby 12 castle towers remain in existence today. All of these 12 existing castle towers are ancient examples of architecture which have been preserved in accordance with the Law for the Protection of Cultural Properties. The castle towers designated as National Treasures are sometimes referred to as the ‘Kokuho Shijo’ (the 4 castles designated as National Treasures) (as christened by the Tourism Council for the Cities with the National Treasure Castles), whereas the castle towers designated as Important Cultural Properties are sometimes referred to as the ‘8 Jubun Castles’ (the 8 castles designated as Important Cultural Properties). </p>
<p>These are said to be the ‘real castles (castle towers)’as contrasted to those castle towers that have generally been reconstructed in modern times. An exorbitant amount of money is required to maintain and preserve castle towers, as such work demands the traditional technique of castle building, down to each of the nails used, under the supervision of the Agency for Cultural Affairs. Since there are 12 castles, they are sometimes used in calendars. <h3>Features</h3>
</p>
<p>Various descriptions, including distinct features of each castle tower, have been given in this section, but articles and reading matters on the respective castle should be referenced for more details. The following list of castles is in order of appearance in Japan’s Top 100 Castles, and the representative crests have been designated by the National Conference of Castle Administrators. Additionally, the terms Shinpan(relatives of the Tokugawa family), Fudai (Hereditary), and Tozama (Non-hereditary) are the classifications of feudal lords in effect at the Meiji Restoration, and the information on Kokudaka is based on the survey conducted by the Edo bakufu in 1863. The years that the castle towers were built indicate the years of construction of the respective buildings which exist today. For information on the year of construction and architecture of older buildings, articles and reading matters on the respective castle should be referenced. </p>

<p>It is a free-standing, multi-level, tower-type keep consisting of 3 tiers and 3 stories which, among the existing castle towers, is situated furthest northeastern. 
<br/>After the original castle tower was burnt down by lightning in 1627, the three-tiered, three-story castle tower was newly built in the Sotogata (multi-level tower-type keep) style as a yagura (turret) on paper in deference to the bakufu in 1810 and it was reported to be a ‘three-story turret.’<br/>
With respect to construction, on the east and south sides of the castle tower facing outside the castle, there are 2 tiers of gables where bay windows and ledges are present in addition to oillets instead of windows. On the west and north sides of the castle tower facing inside the castle, however, there are no gables, which are characteristics of castle tower architecture, but there is a series of windows. Additionally, to resist low temperatures, the orca ornaments and roofs are finished with copper tiles (made of copper-laminated wooden molds).
