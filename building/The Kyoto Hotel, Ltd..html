<h1>The Kyoto Hotel, Ltd. (京都ホテル)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The Kyoto Hotel, Ltd., with its head office in Nakagyo-ku Ward of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>, is a company that runs hotels. Its main facility 'Kyoto Hotel Okura' is a long-established leading hotel in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. </p>
<p>Kyoto Hotel Okura<br/>
Kyoto Hotel Okura has its origin in Kyoto Tokiwa <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Ryokan (Japanese-style inns).html">Ryokan</a> which was founded at Kawabata-dori Street <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Nijo-dori Street.html">Nijo-dori Street</a> by Matakichi MAEDA, a businessman of Kobe, in 1888. Maeda bought from the government the vacant lot (Kawaramachi-dori Street <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Oike-dori Street.html">Oike-dori Street</a>, where the hotel stands now) of the defunct Kangyo-jo (the Commercial and Industrial Promotion Center), where he had Dai Nippon Construction (now Taisei Corporation) construct a Western style wooden hotel building 'Tokiwa Hotel' and started business in1890. </p>
<p>Yoshitaro INOUE (井上喜太郎) bought Tokiwa Hotel in 1894, and in 1895 he resumed the operation of the hotel when the ceremony of the 1100th anniversary of the foundation of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Heian-kyo.html">Heian-kyo</a> (the ancient capital of Japan in current <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>) was held. In 1928, the new ferroconcrete seven-storey building, designed and constructed by Shimizu Corporation, was completed. </p>
<p>He started constructing the 'Kyoto Hotel Oike <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Honkan.html">Honkan</a>,' a sixty-meter high rise building, in December 1991 under a Comprehensive Design System, and completed it in 1994. There was persistent opposition against the rebuilding of the hotel saying it would destroy the beautiful scenery of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, and heated debates took place about it. </p>
<p>In 2001, Kyoto Hotel decided to tie-up with Hotel Okura as one of its management restructuring measures, and became a member of Okura Hotels & Resorts in 2002 and renamed the main building 'Kyoto Hotel Okura.'<br/>
