<h1>The Kyoto Hotel, Ltd. (京都ホテル)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The Kyoto Hotel, Ltd., with its head office in Nakagyo-ku Ward of Kyoto City, Kyoto Prefecture, is a company that runs hotels. Its main facility 'Kyoto Hotel Okura' is a long-established leading hotel in Kyoto. </p>
<p>Kyoto Hotel Okura<br/>
Kyoto Hotel Okura has its origin in Kyoto Tokiwa Ryokan which was founded at Kawabata-dori Street Nijo-dori Street by Matakichi MAEDA, a businessman of Kobe, in 1888. Maeda bought from the government the vacant lot (Kawaramachi-dori Street Oike-dori Street, where the hotel stands now) of the defunct Kangyo-jo (the Commercial and Industrial Promotion Center), where he had Dai Nippon Construction (now Taisei Corporation) construct a Western style wooden hotel building 'Tokiwa Hotel' and started business in1890. </p>
<p>Yoshitaro INOUE (井上喜太郎) bought Tokiwa Hotel in 1894, and in 1895 he resumed the operation of the hotel when the ceremony of the 1100th anniversary of the foundation of Heian-kyo (the ancient capital of Japan in current Kyoto) was held. In 1928, the new ferroconcrete seven-storey building, designed and constructed by Shimizu Corporation, was completed. </p>
<p>He started constructing the 'Kyoto Hotel Oike Honkan,' a sixty-meter high rise building, in December 1991 under a Comprehensive Design System, and completed it in 1994. There was persistent opposition against the rebuilding of the hotel saying it would destroy the beautiful scenery of Kyoto, and heated debates took place about it. </p>
<p>In 2001, Kyoto Hotel decided to tie-up with Hotel Okura as one of its management restructuring measures, and became a member of Okura Hotels & Resorts in 2002 and renamed the main building 'Kyoto Hotel Okura.'<br/>
