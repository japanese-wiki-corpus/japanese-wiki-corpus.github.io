<h1>Nagare-zukuri style (流造)</h1>
<p>Nagare-zukuri style is an architectural style of Japanese shrines. </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>The nagare-zukuri style, which is represented by Kamowakeikazuchi-jinja Shrine (Kamigamo-jinja Shrine) and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Kamomioya-jinja Shrine.html">Kamomioya-jinja Shrine</a> (Shimogamo-jinja Shrine), is an advanced variation of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Shinmei-zukuri style (a term concerning architecture).html">Shinmei-zukuri style</a>, which is represented by Ise-jingu Shrine. The style is characterized by a long-extending, curved front slope of the warped roof, which constitutes a kohai (eave). 
<br/>This is the most popular architectural style among Japanese shrines<br/>
<h3>Structure</h3>
</p>
<p>The nagare-zukuri style employs a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/kirizuma-zukuri (an architectural style).html">kirizuma-zukuri</a>/hirairi structure, and its roof forms a graceful curve similar to that of taisha-zukuri style. This makes the nagare-zukuri style different from the shinmei-zukuri style, which is characterized by its straight external appearance. <h3>Roof</h3>
</p>
<p>Unlike the shinmei-zukuri style, the roof is not only thatched but also covered with a variety of materials, such as kokeras (thin plates of wood), cypress bark shingles, etc. </p>
<p>Each of the gables of the roof is decorated with a gegyo (decoration board) and forms a graceful curve. </p>
<p>The slope of the roof is not steep. The roof is characterized by a long curve which smoothly extends forward from the minoko (curved surface portion for adjustment) to the kohai. </p>
<p>Columns<br/>
</p>
<p>Similar to the shinmei-zukuri style, the nagare-zukuri style is bilaterally symmetric, and an even number of columns are provided in the width direction. </p>
<p>Round columns and chamfered rectangular columns are respectively used for the building and the kohai, and a funahijiki (horizontal member) is provided on each of the rectangular columns. </p>
<p>When the ketayuki (the distance between columns in the width direction) is one ken (1.8182 m) (the number of columns is two), it is called ikkensha-nagare-zukuri style, and when the distance is three kens (5.4546 m), it is called sangensha-nagare-zukuri style (the number of columns is four). </p>
<p>Walls<br/>
</p>
<p>An opening with a butterfly formation door is provided in the central portion of the front wall. </p>
<p>Floors<br/>
</p>
<p>A hamayuka floor is provided at the height of the groundsill, and a building floor is provided at the height of the staircase. <h3>History of nagare-zukuri style</h3>
</p>
<p>Because it is an advanced variation of the shinmei-zukuri style, its history is not long. The oldest surviving nagare-zukuri style building is the honden (main hall) of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Ujigami-jinja Shrine.html">Ujigami-jinja Shrine</a>, which was built in the latter half of the Heian period. </p>
