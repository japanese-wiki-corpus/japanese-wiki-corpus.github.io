<h1>Otori-zukuri style (大鳥造)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Otori-zukuri style is one of the architectural styles of shrines in Japan. </p>
<p><h3>Structures</h3>
</p>
<p>Similarly to taisha-zukuri style, otori-zukuri style architecture is square-shaped with an area of approximately 3.6 sq.m., but without a veranda (a narrow wooden passageway along the edge of a house facing the garden) or the sacred core pillar installed at the center of the main sanctuary of a shrine. The entrance is located at the center on the front, and the inside is divided into a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Naijin (Inner sanctuary of a shrine or a temple).html">naijin</a> (inner sanctuary of a shrine or temple) and a gejin (part of the main sanctuary outside the innermost sanctum of a shrine) with a shinza (seat of the deity) situated at the center of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Naijin (Inner sanctuary of a shrine or a temple).html">naijin</a>. </p>
<p>Otori-zukuri style employs <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/kirizuma-zukuri (an architectural style).html">kirizuma-zukuri</a> style (an architectural style with a gabled roof) with a Tsuma-iri (entrance on gable side), and many have more linear roofs than those of taisha-zukuri style. <h3>Roofs</h3>
</p>
<p>The roofs are not necessarily thatched; there are wide varieties, from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Kokerabuki.html">kokerabuki</a> (a roof covering made with a layer of thin wooden shingles made of cypress) to hiwadabuki (cypress bark roof). </p>
<p>The hafu (a barge board) on the front that supports the roof is decorated with a gegyo (decorative wooden board used to cover the ridge and purlin ends on a roof gable). </p>
<p>Pillars<br/>
</p>
<p>The architecture is square-shaped with an area of approximately 3.6 sq.m. without the sacred core pillar installed at the center of the main sanctuary of a shrine, or pillars at the center on the front. </p>
<p>Walls<br/>
</p>
<p>A double-door opening is provided at one location, at the center on the front. </p>
<p>Floors<br/>
</p>
<p>The floor is lower than those of taisha-zukuri style and shinmei-zukuri style. </p>
