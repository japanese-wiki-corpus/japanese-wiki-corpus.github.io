<h1>Hiyoku irimoya-zukuri style (比翼入母屋造)</h1>
<p></p>

<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>A similar style is sangensha Hiyoku irimora-zukuri style adopted by Yuga-jinja Shrine (Kurashiki City, Okayama Prefecture). <h3>Structures</h3>

<p>Hiyoku irimoya-zukuri style structure consists of a Honden with Butsuden (Buddha Hall) style employed inside, and a Haiden (a hall of worship) at the front. In particular, the roof of the Honden has a hip-and-gable roof shape, in which two parallel hipped roofs are joined to a roof on the same level, making up a single roof ridge.
