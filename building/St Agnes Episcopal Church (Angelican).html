<h1>St Agnes' Episcopal Church (Angelican) (聖アグネス教会)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>St Agnes' Episcopal Church (Angelican), a church in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>, Japan, is the cathedral of the Diocese of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, the Anglican-Episcopal Church of Japan<br/>
The church was named after St. Agnes, a martyr under Roman Emperor Diocletianus and has become the patron saint of Heian Jogakuin St. Agnes School. </p>
<p>Summary<br/>
</p>
<p>When constructed in 1898 as the chapel of Heian Jogakuin St. Agnes School, it was called "Sei-san-ichi daiseido" (literally a sacred three-one cathedral), but St Agnes Church was organized in 1923 by persons related to Heian Jogakuin St. Agnes School and now, St Agnes Church is called a cathedral. The Gothic style brick building was designed by James McDonald GARDINER, the first schoolmaster of St. Paul's school. 
<br/>In the daily records of the school, immediately after the completion of building the cathedral, it was written; 'The school was instructed by the police to change the crest on the tower because it might be confused with a chrysanthemum.'<br/>
The <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> campus of Heian Jogakuin St. Agnes School, where the church is located, is in the former <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Nijo-jo Castle.html">Nijo-jo Castle</a> where <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshiaki ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshiaki ASHIKAGA</a> resided, and a stone monument where the description of 'the former <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Nijo-jo Castle.html">Nijo-jo Castle</a> site' is inscribed is placed at a corner of the school premises. </p>
