<h1>St Agnes' Episcopal Church (Angelican) (聖アグネス教会)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>St Agnes' Episcopal Church (Angelican), a church in Kyoto City, Kyoto Prefecture, Japan, is the cathedral of the Diocese of Kyoto, the Anglican-Episcopal Church of Japan<br/>
The church was named after St. Agnes, a martyr under Roman Emperor Diocletianus and has become the patron saint of Heian Jogakuin St. Agnes School. </p>
<p>Summary<br/>
</p>
<p>When constructed in 1898 as the chapel of Heian Jogakuin St. Agnes School, it was called "Sei-san-ichi daiseido" (literally a sacred three-one cathedral), but St Agnes Church was organized in 1923 by persons related to Heian Jogakuin St. Agnes School and now, St Agnes Church is called a cathedral. The Gothic style brick building was designed by James McDonald GARDINER, the first schoolmaster of St. Paul's school. 
<br/>In the daily records of the school, immediately after the completion of building the cathedral, it was written; 'The school was instructed by the police to change the crest on the tower because it might be confused with a chrysanthemum.'<br/>
The Kyoto campus of Heian Jogakuin St. Agnes School, where the church is located, is in the former Nijo-jo Castle where Yoshiaki ASHIKAGA resided, and a stone monument where the description of 'the former Nijo-jo Castle site' is inscribed is placed at a corner of the school premises. </p>
