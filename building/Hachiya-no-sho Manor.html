<h1>Hachiya-no-sho Manor (蜂屋荘)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Hachiya-no-sho Manor was a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> (manor in medieval Japan) that existed in Mino Province during the Heian and Muromachi periods. It was one of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Chokodo-ryo (Chokodos territory).html">Chokodo-ryo</a> （estates of Imperial family). </p>
<p><h3>Location</h3>
</p>
<p>It was located in Kamo District, Mino Province (Gifu Prefecture)<br/>
It consisted of the southern area of present-day Minokamo City, Gifu Prefecture and the northeastern part of Sakahogi-cho. <h3>Size</h3>
</p>
<p>Unknown<br/>
</p>
<p>Origin<br/>
</p>
<p>By the late Heian Period, it was already the territory of the Sekkan-ke (the families which produced the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Regent.html">Regent</a> and the Chief Adviser to the Emperor). <h3>Feudal Lord</h3>
</p>
<p>Sekkan-ke → Imperial family (Emperor Go-Shirakawa, Emperor <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Senyomonin.html">Senyomonin</a>, etc.), Minamoto clan (MINAMOTO no Nakakane, MINAMOTO no Nakanari, etc.） / Nijo family → Aburanokoji family → Saionji family<br/>
<h3>Demise</h3>
</p>
<p>It is probable that the manor was oppressed by the force of the jito (manager and lord of a manor) during the Muromachi Period. <h3>Notes</h3>
</p>
<p>During the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period, it split into Minami-no-sho (南荘) (south manor) and Kita-no-sho (北荘) (north manor). </p>
<p>In the first part of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period, Tsunetane CHIBA wanted to become jito of the manor, but he could not achieve this. </p>
<p>This <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> is the place of origin of the Hachiya clan, a branch of the Toki clan. </p>
