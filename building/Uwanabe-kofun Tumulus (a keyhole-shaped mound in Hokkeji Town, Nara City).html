<p>In the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period investigation was made by William Gowland, who was a British engineer in Osaka Mint Bureau and also a mountaineer. After returning to the United Kingdom in 1897, he published a monograph, 'The Dolmens and Mounds in Japan,' in which he referred to a certain tumulus (of which the name was not mentioned), but now the tumulus he mentioned has been analogically considered as the Uwanabe-kofun Tumulus. </p>
