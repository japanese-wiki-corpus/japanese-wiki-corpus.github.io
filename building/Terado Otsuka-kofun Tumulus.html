<h1>Terado Otsuka-kofun Tumulus (寺戸大塚古墳)</h1>
<p>Terado Otsuka-kofun Tumulus is situated in Nishinooka (Muko-kyuryo Hills), Muko City, Kyoto Prefecture. It is a keyhole-shaped mound built in the early Kofun (Tumulus) period. </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>The Terado Otsuka-kofun Tumulus is one of the tumuli in Muko-kyuryo Hills. It appears to have been constructed in the middle of the early Kofun (tumulus) period. It is slightly tilted west with a pit rock chamber in both the front square and the back circular part. A triangular-rimmed mirror excavated in the tumulus seems to be in an isomorphic relationship with the one from the Tsubai Otsukayama-kofun Tumulus. This suggests that the one who was buried in the Terado Otsuka-kofun Tumulus may have been a subject of the person buried in the Tsubai Otsukayama-kofun Tumulus. </p>
<p>Most of the front part is lost as earth has been added to the bamboo forest. </p>
<p>At the top of the mound there is an eight meters square site lined with haniwa clay figures, immediately below where the stone chamber lies. </p>
<p>The tumulus has an offering place for Haji pottery. <h3>Size and Shape</h3>
