<h1>Mikuriya (a kitchen) (御厨)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Mikuriya is the honorific expression of Kuriya (a kitchen). In medieval Japan, Mikuriya indicated a manor of the Imperial family or dominant shrines, such as Ise-jingu Shrine, (a shrine estate), and this term still remains in geographic names. In the Medieval period, it often happened that Mikuriya were pillaged by samurai troops (and converted to samurai-owned estates). </p>
<p>Soma Mikuriya and Oba no Mikuriya are famous historically. </p>
<p><h3>Geographic names that still remain today</h3>
</p>
<p>The term "Mikuriya" remains as a geographic name in various parts of Japan, not only in the name of cities, towns, or villages, but also as the name of oaza (a larger section of a village) or koaza (a subsection of a village). Such areas exist in Kiryu City, Gunma Prefecture, and in Higashi-Osaka City, Osaka Prefecture. In addition, a station named "Mikuriya-eki Station" exists in Matsuura City, Nagasaki Prefecture. </p>
<p>"Mikuriya" is also used as a family name. Kei MIKURIYA, Satomi MIKURIYA, and Takashi MIKURIYA are famous examples. In fiction, Jin MIKURIYA appears in "Kannagi," manga created by Eri TAKENASHI, and (although not being intentional) also in "893 ways of becoming a detective," a comic book by Takemaru ABIKO. </p>
<p>In the past, there were cities, towns, and villages whose names included "Mikuriya," as in the following:<br/>
