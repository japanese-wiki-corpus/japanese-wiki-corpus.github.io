<h1>Nikka-mon (or Jikka Mon) Gate (日華門)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Nikka-mon (or jikka mon) Gate was one of the naikaku-mon gates that comprised the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Dairi (the Imperial palace).html">dairi</a> (Imperial Palace) and was located on the east side of the south garden of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Shishinden Hall (Hall for state ceremonies).html">Shishinden Hall</a> (Throne Hall). </p>
<p>The Nikka-mon Gate that stands in the present Kyoto Imperial Palace was rebuilt according to the ancient design. </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>Located between <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Giyoden Hall (Treasure Hall).html">Giyoden Hall</a> (Treasure Hall) and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Shunkyoden Hall.html">Shunkyoden Hall</a>, the gate faced <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Gekka-mon Gate.html">Gekka-mon Gate</a> on the west side of the south garden in an east-west direction. It was also called "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Higashi (dry sweets; dry confectionary).html">Higashi</a> no Chu-mon" (lit. eastern inner gate) and "Sakonfu no Jin" (lit. Post of the Inner Palace Guards) because it was assigned to serve as a post for the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Konoefu (Headquarters of the Inner Palace Guards).html">Konoefu</a> (Inner Palace Guards). </p>
<p>During the Sekkan period (period of regents and advisors), the Court Council (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Jin no Sadame.html">Jin no Sadame</a>; ancient cabinet council) chaired by regents and advisors was frequently held in the Sakone (Left Division of Inner Palace Guards) court in the roofed corridor that led from the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Shishinden Hall (Hall for state ceremonies).html">Shishinden Hall</a> to the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Giyoden Hall (Treasure Hall).html">Giyoden Hall</a>. Because of this, Nikka-mon gate was considered to be more important than Gekka-mon gate due to its close proximity to the Sakone court. </p>
