<h1>Junna-in Palace (淳和院)</h1>
<p>Junna-in Palace was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Junna.html">Emperor Junna</a>'s <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Rikyu (an Imperial villa).html">Rikyu</a> (an imperial villa) or Goin Palace in Ukyo Shi jo Ni bo (present-day <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Ukyo Ward.html">Ukyo Ward</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>) in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Heian-kyo.html">Heian-kyo</a> (the ancient capital of Japan in current <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>.)<br/>
Later, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Genji choja.html">Genji choja</a> (the top of the Minamoto clan) served as chief of Junna-in Palace as well as Shogaku-in college (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Daigaku-besso.html">Daigaku-besso</a>, and academy for nobles). Another name was Sai or <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Saiin (the Priestess or the residence of the Priestess).html">Saiin</a>. </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>The year of construction is unknown, but in 813 when <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Junna.html">Emperor Junna</a>'s Kotaitei (the younger brother of an Emperor sho is heir apparent) was taking up the reins, his older brother <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Saga.html">Emperor Saga</a> visited this place called Nanchi-in Palace at that time. After the enthronement of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Junna.html">Emperor Junna</a>, it became <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Rikyu (an Imperial villa).html">Rikyu</a>, and on March 26, 833, he declared the abdication of the throne to his nephew Imperial Prince Masara (Emperor Ninmyo) here. 
<br/>Before this enthronement, the name was changed to 'Junna-in Palace.'<br/>
After stepping down from the throne, the Retired <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Junna.html">Emperor Junna</a> lived here with Empress Dowager, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Imperial Princess Masako.html">Imperial Princess Masako</a> (Dowager Empress Junna, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Saga.html">Emperor Saga</a>'s Imperial Princess), and died in seven years. After the Retired Emperor's bereaved child, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Imperial Prince Tsunesada.html">Imperial Prince Tsunesada</a> was deposed from princess due to the Jowa Incident and confined to Junna-in Palace, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Imperial Princess Masako.html">Imperial Princess Masako</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Imperial Prince Tsunesada.html">Imperial Prince Tsunesada</a> were quietly devoted to Buddhism training here. After the palace burned in 874 and was rebuilt, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Imperial Princess Masako.html">Imperial Princess Masako</a> made this palace a temple for nuns who could not officially become priests due to the Court's Buddhism policy. On January 8, 882, after the death of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Imperial Princess Masako.html">Imperial Princess Masako</a>, at the request of Imperial Prince Tsunetada, the Court established <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kugyo.html">Kugyo</a> betto at this palace to manage Junna-in Palace, the imperial mausoleums of the Retired <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Saga.html">Emperor Saga</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/TACHIBANA no Kachiko.html">TACHIBANA no Kachiko</a> and Dowager Empress Junna (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Imperial Princess Masako.html">Imperial Princess Masako</a>), <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Daikaku-ji Temple.html">Daikaku-ji Temple</a> associated with the Retired <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Saga.html">Emperor Saga</a> and Danrin-ji Temple associated with the Empress <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Danrin.html">Danrin</a>. The <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kugyo.html">Kugyo</a> (a top court official) assigned to this post was called Junnain Betto (chancellor of Junna-in Palace). </p>
<p>Because the Retired <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Saga.html">Emperor Saga</a> was an ancestor of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Saga-Genji.html">Saga-Genji</a> (Minamoto clan) as the first Minamoto clan, the idea that the post of Junnain Betto would be connected with the Minamoto clan was gradually accepted. In 1140, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Masasada.html">MINAMOTO no Masasada</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Genji choja.html">Genji choja</a> (the top of the Minamoto clan) of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/family/Murakami-Genji (Minamoto clan).html">Murakami-Genji</a> (Minamoto clan) took the posts of both Junnain Betto and Shogakuin Betto (chancellor of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Shogakuin.html">Shogakuin</a>,) and after that, the custom that <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Genji choja.html">Genji choja</a> served as both Junnain Betto and Shogakuin Betto continued until the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Meiji Restoration (Meiji-ishin).html">Meiji Restoration</a>. Initially, the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Genji choja.html">Genji choja</a> post was filled by people from the Koga family and the Nakanoin family, as these were <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/family/Murakami-Genji (Minamoto clan).html">Murakami-Genji</a>'s main branches, though there were cases in which these posts were taken by members of branches of the Koba or Nakanoin families. However, after <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshimitsu ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshimitsu ASHIKAGA</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Seii Taishogun.html">Seii Taishogun</a> (literally, "great general who subdues the barbarians") of the Muromachi <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>), was assigned to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Genji choja.html">Genji choja</a> in 1383 and at the same time took the posts of both Junnain Betto and Shogakuin Betto, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> of the Muromachi shogunate continued to take the two Betto posts. After the Meio Coup, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/family/Murakami-Genji (Minamoto clan).html">Murakami-Genji</a> again continued to be assigned to the post of the family head of the Minamoto clan and the two Betto posts. However, as a result of confusion in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> in and after the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Onin War.html">Onin War</a>, it is thought that Junna-in Palace disappeared or was destroyed and Junnain Betto was just a nominal title. When <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Ieyasu TOKUGAWA.html">Ieyasu TOKUGAWA</a> established the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Edo bakufu.html">Edo bakufu</a>, he took the posts of the family head of the Minamoto clan and Junnain Betto and Shogakuin Betto, and after that successive Shoguns continued to take the posts. </p>
<p>In 1927, the Junna-in Palace ruins were excavated and large numbers of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kawara (tile).html">Kawara</a> tiles and earthenware were discovered. </p>
