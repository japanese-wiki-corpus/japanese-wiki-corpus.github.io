<h1>Rokaku (a multi-storied building) (楼閣)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Rokaku indicates a multi-storied building. Its meaning is the same as that of "takadono" or "Koro (高楼)." Its meaning is similar to that of a tower, but "tower" originally indicated a Buddhist tower in ancient times and in modern days "tower" has come to be used as translated word "entower." Before that, a multi-storied building was generally called a rokaku or a koro (tall building). </p>
<p><h3>In China</h3>
</p>
<p>楼 (=樓) (rou) indicates a multi-storied building and 閣 (kaku) a building located in a high place, such as a palace or a turret, with a building meeting both of these conditions generally called 楼閣 (rokaku). In China, many rokakus were built on the riverside or on the seaside for commemorating big national events or for political demonstration purposes. Since it was also customary that a boro (watch tower) was placed in a castle gate, you can see boroes as important relics of rokakus as well. The oldest wooden rokaku relic is the Kannon-kaku of Dokuraku-ji Temple (located in Ji County, Tianjin City), built in 984 of the Liao era. </p>
<p>The sight of a large, lofty tower still standing on a riverside was admired by many poets, who produced many masterpieces of interesting and tasteful poems, for example, '黄鶴楼送孟浩然之広陵' (Sending off Haoran MENG for Yangju at Yellow Crane Tower) by Li Bai and '黄鶴楼' (Yellow Crane Tower) by Hao Cui (around 704 - 754). <h3>Koro</h3>

<p>A koro is a rokaku used for informing people the time, and the one in Nanjing City is famous.

<h3>In Japan</h3>
</p>
<p>The first rokaku building in Japan is boroes (watch towers) during the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yayoi period.html">Yayoi period</a>. However, multi-storied buildings were scarcely used, and in many of Buddhist towers which are seemingly multi-storied, rooms were provided only on the ground level, with only roofs constructed for the higher portion. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Shinden-zukuri.html">Shinden-zukuri</a> style buildings and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Shoin-zukuri.html">shoin-zukuri</a> style buildings for noblepersons' residences were also one-storied. During the Muromachi period and later eras, temples and tea rooms employing a continental-style rokaku increasingly corresponded to the increasing popularity of the zen sect. Multi-storied buildings were important not only from the viewpoint of the design, but were also built intended for looking down at people from a higher position that provided a commanding view of the area around them. Typical of such examples are <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Rokuon-ji Temple.html">Rokuon-ji Temple</a> and the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Jisho-ji Temple.html">Jisho-ji Temple</a> in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. On the other hand, due to military necessity and also for the necessity of warring loads strengthening the control of their territories, '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Tenshu.html">tenshu</a>' (also tenshukaku: castle turret) was designed based on boroes, with many such turrets built as a symbol of castle buildings. On the other hand, rokaku buildings in temples in Japan developed independently of those on the continent, and many superior wooden rokakus, such as Hiunkaku in Nishihongan-ji Temple, were designed and built. In the modern period, guest rooms of inns in urban areas came to be built on the second floor to make land space available and to be used more effectively. Long-established inns' names of '--楼 (ro)' or '--閣 (kaku)' would be reminiscent of those days. Entering the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> era, brick-made rokakus, such as Ryounkaku (so-called Asakusa Twelve Stories), were built, but these buildings would be more appropriately called high-rise buildings. </p>
