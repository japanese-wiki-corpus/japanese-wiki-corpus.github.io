<p>The cypress bark roof is a roofing method which uses cypress bark. </p>
<p>It is a traditional technique peculiar to Japan since ancient times, being a one-of-a-kind roofing method in the world. The cypress bark roofing is used with numerous cultural assets in Japan. </p>
<p>Material<br/>
Bark of standing timbers of cypress, 70 years old or older with sufficient diameter, is peeled and molded to become the roofing material. </p>
<p>When collecting cypress bark, since only the superficial part of the bark is peeled off of standing cypress without cutting down trees, it is said to be an environmentally friendly roofing method. </p>
<p>In recent years, however, there have been a few challenges, including a decreasing number of cypress trees that are large enough, as well as a decreasing number of craftspeople to collect cypress bark known as motokawa-shi. </p>
<p>History<br/>
The oldest recorded case of the cypress bark roof was the roofing various halls of Sofuku-ji Temple (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Otsu City.html">Otsu City</a>) (an abandoned temple) with cypress bark in 668. </p>
<p>It is said that the cypress bark roof was used for many buildings of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Heijo-kyu Palace.html">Heijo-kyu Palace</a> in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Nara Period.html">Nara Period</a>. </p>
<p>At <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Heijo-kyu Palace.html">Heijo-kyu Palace</a> the main buildings were tile-roofed, whereas the auxiliary buildings were covered with cypress bark roofs. </p>
<p>Since then, the cypress bark roof began to be used for residences of aristocrats, Buddhist temples and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> shrines being considered the most prestigious examples of roofing techniques, including kokera-buki (roofing with thin wood shingles), thatching, and tiling. </p>
<p>It is thought that the technique that remains in existence today developed subsequent to the Heian Period. </p>
<p>Installation of Cypress Bark Roof<br/>
Lay cypress bark pieces and nail each shingle with bamboo nails, laying the next row of shingles on top of the ones that have been fixed, with a 1.2 cm overlap. </p>
<p>The cypress bark roof gives depth and an air of stateliness to a building while enhancing the appearance of the roof with an airy and graceful curved line. </p>
