<p><h3>History</h3>
</p>
<p>In 1869, the Sanbangumi elementary school (the third elementary school) (later Meirin elementary school) was opened on the former Meirinsha site. </p>
<p>In 1931, the school building was rebuilt into one made of reinforced concrete. </p>
<p>In 1993, the Kyoto City-run Meirin elementary school was closed. </p>
<p>In 1996, a plan to use the former Meirin elementary school as 'a center for promoting interactive art/culture-related activities' was compiled in 'A plan to promote art/culture-related activities in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>' by 'the council to deliberate on use of former school sites.'<br/>
</p>
<p>The building of the former Meirin elementary school was expanded as well as partially reformed and opened as the Kyoto Art Center in April, 2000. </p>
