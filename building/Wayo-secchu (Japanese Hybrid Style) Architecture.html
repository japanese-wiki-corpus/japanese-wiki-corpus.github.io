<h1>Wayo-secchu (Japanese Hybrid Style) Architecture (和洋折衷建築)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Wayo-secchu (Japanese Hybrid Style) architecture refers to buildings constructed in modern Japan that intentionally blend elements of Japanese and Western architecture. </p>
<p>It is said to have originated in Yokohama City at the end of the Edo period, and such buildings were constructed throughout Japan after the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Meiji Restoration (Meiji-ishin).html">Meiji Restoration</a>. 
<br/>The style is characterized by a combination of elements of Western architecture which was considered civilized, and Japanese architecture which was seen as a symbol of traditional status<br/>
</p>
<p>Representative examples include Mitsui-gumi House (later First <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/National Bank (Meiji Period).html">National Bank</a> main office) in Tokyo built in 1872, Kaichi Gakko Primary School in Matsumoto City built in 1876, and Seika-tei in Sapporo City in 1881. </p>
