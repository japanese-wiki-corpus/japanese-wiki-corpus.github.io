<h1>Hira-jiro castle (平城)</h1>
<p>A Hira-jiro castle indicates a castle built on flat land. It is a castle category based on geographical features that was classified by military scholars in the Edo period. </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>Before and during the Sengoku period (Period of Warring States in Japan), most castles were built on mountains (these were known as Yama-shiro castles); very few were built on flat land. However, if no suitable mountain could be found to build a castle on, one was built on flat land. In such cases, one or more rivers were used as a line of defense for the castle, with mounds and walls built for its protection. </p>
<p>Nagoya-jo Castle, Sunpu-jo Castel, Ni-jo Castle and Hiroshima-jo Castles are typical examples of Hira-jiro castle in early-modern times. Although Edo-jo Castle and Osaka-jo Castle are sometimes considered Hira-jiro castles, they are sometimes classified as Hirayama-jiro castles (those built on a hill in a plain). Examples of Mizu-shiro (castles built on lakes or marshes for defensive reasons) include Takamatsu-jo Castle (in Sanuki province), Imabari-jo Castle, Nakatsu-jo Castle, Takashima-jo Castle, and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Zeze-jo Castle.html">Zeze-jo Castle</a> (the first three examples given here all appear in the list of the top three castles in Japan). <h3>History</h3>
</p>
<p>Hira-jiro castles were based on the following two types of buildings: Hokei-yakata buildings, which were <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> residences built in the early <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period and the period of the Northern and Southern Courts (Japan) on flat land surrounded by mounds and walls; and Ta-te buildings, such as the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shugosho (provincial administration).html">Shugosho</a> (provincial administration offices) where <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a> (military governors) lived in the later days of the Muromachi period and the Sengoku period. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shugosho (provincial administration).html">Shugosho</a> were built to imitate the gosho (residence) of the Muromachi <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>), and Yama-shiro castles were mostly used as a tsume—no-shiro castle (a kind of castle of last refuge). <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shugosho (provincial administration).html">Shugosho</a> were built at a strategic spot along a main road or water transportation system. </p>
<p>Local lords came to use <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shugosho (provincial administration).html">shugosho</a> more frequently, and castles were built in a similar style. The Muromachi-dai, which <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Nobunaga ODA.html">Nobunaga ODA</a> built as a residence for <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshiaki ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshiaki ASHIKAGA</a> in the late Muromachi period, and Ni-jo Castle are believed to have influenced the architecture of Hira-jiro castles in the later part of early modern times. </p>
<p>In early modern times, castles with a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Tenshu.html">tenshu</a> (main tower) were built. However, the building of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Tenshu.html">tenshu</a> gradually became less common for the following reasons: the building of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Tenshu.html">tenshu</a> without permission was prohibited following the enactment of Buke shohatto (Laws for the Military Houses); the building of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Tenshu.html">tenshu</a> became unnecessary; some <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Tenshu.html">tenshu</a> were destroyed in natural disasters; and the construction of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Tenshu.html">tenshu</a> put too much of a burden on a domain's finances. </p>
