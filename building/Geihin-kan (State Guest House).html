<h1>Geihin-kan (State Guest House) (迎賓館)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The Geihin-kan (State Guest House) is a facility in which the government accommodates visiting state guests, such as heads of state or ministers. </p>
<p>Summary<br/>
It is used for banquets, such as return parties to the welcoming dinners at the Imperial Palace, which are a diplomatic procedure attended by the Emperor and the Imperial Family. </p>
<p>Japan has two State Guest Houses belonging to the national facilities under the Cabinet Office: the State Guest House, Akasaka Palace, Tokyo (Akasaka Geihinkan): and Kyoto State Guest House in Kyoto Gyoen, Kamigyo-ku, Kyoto City. Although they are not usually open to the public, you may see inside when they are not being used for their primary activities (usually in August), if you apply for a site tour in advance. </p>
<p>The Outline of the Operation of State Guest Houses' defines how to use the Guest Houses (Cabinet decision of July 9, 1974), and 'The Accommodation and Reception of State Guests and Official Guests' defines state guests, official guests, and reception procedures (Cabinet decision of March 16, 1984). According to these stipulations, the government may accommodate or entertain those heads of state or similar foreign dignitaries at the State Guest Houses that the Cabinet has decided to invite as state guests. The Cabinet may also decide to accommodate distinguished foreign guests equivalent to the heads of the three branches of government other than administrative departments. 
<br/>Also, banquets or other official receptions where guests do not stay overnight are often held for heads of state, prime ministers, and other dignitaries who visit Japan for summit diplomacy, as 'Distinguished Official Guests Visiting on Business.'<br/>
Multinational conferences such as the Tokyo Summit Meetings which have been held three times in Japan are categorized together with these events. </p>
<p>The Iikura Annex (Azabudai, Minato Ward, Tokyo) of Foreign Ministry is often used for talks with foreign leaders. </p>
<p><h3>The State Guest House, Akasaka Palace</h3>
</p>
<p>Location: 2-1-1 Motoakasaka, Minato Ward, Tokyo<br/>
</p>
<p>Site area: 117,000 m2<br/>
<h3>History</h3>
</p>
<p>The State Guest House building in Motoakasaka, Tokyo, was constructed in 1909 as Togu-gosho (Crown Prince's Palace). It was designed by the court architect Tokuma KATAYAMA, a pupil of the architect Josiah Conder, and built on the site where the house of the former domain of Kishu used to be, but since it was too luxurious to live in and not suitable for a residence, the Crown Prince (later Emperor Taisho) in fact did not often use it. Later, its name was changed to Akasaka Imperial Villa. </p>
<p>After the War, the site and buildings of Akasaka Imperial Villa were transferred from the Imperial Family to the state, and later used for various purposes: The National Diet Library (1948 - 1961), The Legal Opinion Secretary of Legal Affairs Agency (1948 - 1960), The court for the impeachment trials (1948 - 1970), Diet councils to study constitutional debates (1956 - 1960), and the Tokyo Olympic Organizing Committee (1961 - 1965) among others. </p>
<p>In 1962, the Cabinet agreed to then Prime Minister Hayato IKEDA's proposal to have new guesthouse facilities, because Japan's developing relations with foreign countries had increased the number of distinguished foreign guests, and the former Asakanomiya House (currently the Tokyo Metropolitan Teien Art Museum) in Shiba-Shiroganedai, Minato Ward, which had been used as the State Guest House, was too small to accommodate guests' entourages. </p>
<p>The government studied the plan during the administrations of Ikeda and his successor Eisaku SATO, and decided in 1967 to build a guesthouse facility by renovating the former Akasaka Imperial Villa. The government spent five years and \10.8 billion (\10.1 billion for construction, and \700 million for furniture and the interior) to complete the main building (designed by Togo MURANO) and the Japanese-style annex (designed by Yoshiro TANIGUCHI) in March 1974. </p>
<p>The first state guest to the new State Guest House was the thirty-eighth President of the United States, Gerald Rudolph "Jerry" Ford, Jr. </p>
<p>Major repair work was carried out between 2006 and 2008. Although it had been planned to be completed by the end of March 2008, the work fell behind schedule, and it is currently due to be completed at the end of June 2008. <h3>The main building</h3>
