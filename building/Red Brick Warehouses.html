<p>History<br/>
The Imperial Japanese Navy built red brick buildings throughout the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> and Taisho periods, since <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Maizuru Chinjufu (Maizuru Naval District).html">Maizuru Chinjufu</a> (Maizuru Naval District) was established in Maizuru in 1901. </p>

<h3>Today</h3>
</p>
<p>The former Maizuru Naval Arsenal Fish-type Torpedo Warehouse, built in 1903, now forms the World Brick Museum, and the former Maizuru Naval Arsenal Miscellaneous Articles and Damaged Weapons Warehouse is currently used as Maizuru City Commemoration Hall. </p>
<p>Also, in April 2007, one warehouse at the side of the Maizuru City Commemoration Hall was renovated and reopened as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Maizuru Wisdom Warehouse.html">Maizuru Wisdom Warehouse</a> with its original appearance restored. </p>
<p>Maizuru Warehouse Co., Ltd. uses three warehouses, and the remaining seven buildings are now warehouses belonging to the Maizuru General Directorial Division of the Maritime Self-Defense Force. </p>
<p>The rarity of these old buildings which remain intact makes them valuable, and they have been used as the backdrop for many movies and TV dramas as they represent Japan's modernization. <h3>Examples of movies and TV programs using the warehouses as a backdrop in recent years</h3>
