<h1>Red Brick Warehouses (舞鶴赤レンガ倉庫群)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The "Red Brick Warehouses" are 12 red brick warehouses located at the former headquarters of the Maizuru Navy Ordnance Corps (舞鶴海軍軍需部本部地区) (now Maizuru Port Waterfront) in Maizuru city, Kyoto Prefecture. They are also called "Kitasui Red Brick Warehouses." They are Important Cultural Properties and a Heritage of Industrial Modernization site. </p>
<p>History<br/>
The Imperial Japanese Navy built red brick buildings throughout the Meiji and Taisho periods, since Maizuru Chinjufu (Maizuru Naval District) was established in Maizuru in 1901. </p>
<p>Among the surviving twelve warehouses in the Kitasui area of Higashi-Maizuru, Maizuru City, nine warehouses were built during the period from 1901 to 1903 in the Meiji period, and three were built between 1918 and 1921 in the Taisho period. </p>

<p>The former Maizuru Naval Arsenal Fish-type Torpedo Warehouse, built in 1903, now forms the World Brick Museum, and the former Maizuru Naval Arsenal Miscellaneous Articles and Damaged Weapons Warehouse is currently used as Maizuru City Commemoration Hall. </p>
<p>Also, in April 2007, one warehouse at the side of the Maizuru City Commemoration Hall was renovated and reopened as Maizuru Wisdom Warehouse with its original appearance restored. </p>
<p>Maizuru Warehouse Co., Ltd. uses three warehouses, and the remaining seven buildings are now warehouses belonging to the Maizuru General Directorial Division of the Maritime Self-Defense Force. </p>
