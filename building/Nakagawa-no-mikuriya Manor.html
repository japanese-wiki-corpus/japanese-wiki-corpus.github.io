</p>
<p>Although the Ogasawara clan extended its control as jito (manager and lord of the manor) during the period of the Northern and Southern Courts and the Muromachi period, the manor continued to function as a shinryo (shrine estate) until the Sengoku ｐeriod (ｐeriod of Warring States). <h3>Notes</h3>

<p>Around the middle of 12th century, it became a Saisho (provincial government office (kokuga) in charge of tax collection and management of official articles) for the articles related to the shrine estates that circulated in Mino Province. For shinzei (rice field tax levied and reserved for emergency expenses for the shrine), the manor was obliged to supply 50-koku (approximately 9 cubic meters) of rice and 20-hiki (242.40m) of silk to the naigu (inner shrine), and 25-koku (approximately 4.5 cubic meters) of rice and 10-hiki (121.20m) of silk to the gegu (outer shrine). </p>
