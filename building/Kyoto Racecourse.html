<p></p>
<p>Kyoto Racecourse is a racecourse located in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Fushimi Ward.html">Fushimi Ward</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>. The organizer of racing as well as the administrator of this racecourse is the Japan Racing Association. This racecourse is commonly known as Yodo (or Yodo Racecourse) because of the name of its nearest railway station. It was built at the present location on December 1, 1925. </p>
<p>History<br/>
1925<br/>
Kyoto Racecourse started operation on December 1. </p>
<p>1969<br/>
Stables were moved from the racecourse to the newly constructed Ritto Training Center. </p>
<p>1990<br/>
The pocket of the second corner was extended by about 200 meters. The turf course of 1,800 meters (outer course) and 1,600 meters (inner course) came into use from the third race meeting (corresponded to the fourth meeting in usual years). </p>
<p>1994<br/>
The Heian <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Cavalry.html">cavalry</a> started to use the Kyoto Racecourse as the base of its activities (until 1997). </p>
<p>The renovation of the stand (later became Big Swan) as well as the alteration of the racecourse were completed. </p>
<p>1995<br/>
The horse races of seventh and eighth day of the first race meeting, which were scheduled on January 21 and 22, were cancelled due to the Great Hanshin-Awaji Earthquake. Nikkei Shinshun Hai (Nikkei New Year Cup) was postponed to January 28 (the first day of the second meeting). The horse races of seventh and eighth day of the first race meeting, which were cancelled previously, were held on June 3 (Hankyu Hai) and June 4 (Takarazuka <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Kinen.html">Kinen</a>) as rehabilitation racing. </p>
<p>As the Hanshin Racecourse was damaged, eight race meetings (64 days) were held in the year. </p>
<p>1996<br/>
On February 10, the fifth day of the second race meeting, 10R and 11R were held using the dirt track because of an accumulation of snow. </p>
<p>On the same day, 9R Violet Stakes was conducted under the condition where the position of horses couldn't be confirmed, due to a snow storm that began immediately before the start, until they came to a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Point (Sentoki).html">point</a> about 200 meters before the goal. </p>
<p>1999<br/>
The new stand named Big Swan was completed. </p>
<p>2001<br/>
On January 7, the third day of first race meeting, 10R to 12R were cancelled due to snow. Special races were postponed to the following week. </p>
<p>On January 20, the seventh day of the first race meeting, 6R and subsequent races were cancelled due to heavy snow. These races were held on January 22 after selling betting tickets once again. </p>
<p>2007<br/>
Large-sized Turf Vision, and so on were installed. </p>
<p>2008<br/>
On February 3, the second day of the second race meeting, steeplechase was cancelled due to fallen snow. Also, the starting time of 1R was put off by an hour and 5R and 7R were held on the dirt course instead of turf course. </p>
<p>On February 9, the third day of the second race meeting, 3R and subsequent races were cancelled because it started to snow after the finish of 2R. These races were held on February 11 after selling betting tickets once again. </p>
<p>On February 24, the eighth day of the second race meeting, the steeplechase was cancelled due to fallen snow. Also, the starting time of 1R was put off by 25 minutes and 5R, 6R, 9R, 10R and 11R were held on the dirt instead of the turf course. </p>
<p>2009<br/>
The construction work of the No.2 gate was completed and it came into use on February 28 when Park-WINZ (an event to use the racecourse as an off-course betting shop for the races held at other racecourses) was held. 
<br/>It was named 'Station Gate.'<br/>
Also, No.1 gate was named 'Shinzan Gate.'<br/>
</p>
<p>Courses<br/>
There are two turf courses, the inner course and the outer course. Yodo no saka' (Yodo slope) situated at the third corner of the outer course is famous for 3.9 meters of difference in height. Horses running the Tenno Sho (spring) and the Kikuka Sho (autumn) surmount this slope twice. These days, many jockeys use a spurt on the downward slope from the third corner to the fourth corner since the straight is even. </p>
<p>The radius of the curve from the third to the fourth corner of the outer turf course changes from 109.0 meters to 376.0 meters, to 456.0 meters, then to 100.0 meters. Other characteristics of the course are the angular corners and the false straight (similar to the false strait of Hippodrome de Longchamp) situated between the corners (though Tokyo Racecourse and Hanshin Racecourse have similar characteristics, theirs are not so extreme as those of Kyoto Racecourse). Thanks to the above characteristics, the so-called 'makuri' (a kind of jockey's technique) is effective since the loss of distance is relatively small even though a jokey takes the outer route. Besides, the fourth corner is the most angular one among the turf courses of the JRA racecourses, and the inside part of the course is interrupted by confluence with the inner turf course. Since many jockeys use a spurt taking advantage of the downward slope, a scene where a herd of horses is broken is often seen. </p>
<p>The course for steeplechase splits into two at the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Point (Sentoki).html">point</a> between the backstretch and the third corner. On the course for grand steeplechase, there exist a big hedge of 1.5-meter-high and 2.9-meter-wide (except for a water jump, this is the widest one used for JRA's jumping over steeplechase) and a banquette of 80-centimeter-high and 15.9-meter-wide. 
<br/>(banquette: A stand for jumping up and jumping down, also called 'the Triple Jump' or 'Big Swan,' but the latter is seldom used after the same name was adopted as the nickname for the addition of the stand)<br/>
</p>
<p>Summary of the course<br/>
Turf course: The length of the inner course is 1,782.8 meters and that of the straight is 328.4 meters. The length of the outer course is 1,894.3 meters and that of the straight is 403.7 meters. The number of starting gates is 18 (16 in the case of the outer 2,000 meters course, both figures represent those of A course). </p>
<p>Dirt course: Its length is 1,607.6 meters, the straight is 329.1 meters and the number of stating gates is 16 (14 in the case of 1,000 meters race). </p>
<p>Steeplechase course: Its length is 1,414 meters in the case of ordinary steeplechase and 1,400 meters in the case of great steeplechase. The number of starting gates is 14. </p>

<p><h3>The entrance gate</h3>
</p>
<p>There are two gates, the Shinzan Gate (former No.1 Gate) and the Station Gate (former No.2 Gate). </p>
<p>Station Gate is two-storey and the second floor is expected to be linked to the station by the pedestrian bridge when the Yodo Station of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Keihan Main Line.html">Keihan Main Line</a> is elevated in the autumn of 2009. </p>
<p>On the first floor of Station Gate, ticket gates, ticket counters for ordinary seats, those for reserved seats (today's ticket of lounge seat), weekday pay-off counters, a multi-purpose restroom, and a Tafi Shop (available only after entering) are situated. </p>
<p>On the second floor of the Station Gate, ticket gates, ticket counters for ordinary seats (expected to be in use from the autumn of 2009), and for reserved seats (today's ticket of A-grade reserved seat), a multi-purpose restroom and elevators are situated. </p>
<p>Only persons using A-grade reserved seats are allowed to pass through during the period of third race meeting of 2009. </p>
<p>Tickets for reserved seats for Park-WINZ are on sale on the first floor of Station Gate. <h3>Big Swan</h3>
</p>
<p>This stand was completed in 1999. </p>
<p>Reserved seats are available. </p>
<p>i-Seat (seventh floor of the stand, 243 seats for non-smokers, 3,000 yen, to be booked by phone and paid by JRA Card) from October 11, 2008. Previously, these seats were used as Gondola seats. i-seats are available on a first-come basis on the day of Park-WINZ (1,000 yen). </p>
<p>Box seats (sixth floor of the stand, 272 seats for non-smokers, 2,000 yen, to be booked by phone and paid by JRA Card)<br/>
Lounge seats (sixth floor of the stand, 480 seats for non-smokers, 1,000 yen, available on first-come basis on the day)<br/>
Lounge seats (fifth floor of the stand, 496 seats for smokers, 444 seats for non-smokers 1,000 yen, available on first-come basis on the day)<br/>
Other than the above, facilities such as Shigunetto Hall (third and fourth floor), Memorial Road (third floor), horserace i-Spot (second floor), fast food plaza, kids room, and fan club (first floor) are also available. </p>
<p>Betting tickets can be purchased and refunded at the 107 counter (paddock side) from 9:00 to 17:00 (sales starts at 9:30 at other counters). <h3>Grand Swan</h3>
</p>
<p>Completed in 1980. After the renovation conducted in 1994, glass was installed in front of the horse owners' seats and the reserved seat zone. </p>
<p>A variety of reserved seats are available as shown below. </p>
<p>Special A-grade reserved seats (fifth floor of the stand, 650 seats for non-smokers, 3,000 yen, available on first-come basis on the day)<br/>
A-grade reserved seats (fifth floor of the stand, 624 seats for non-smokers, 2,500 yen, 204 seats are available on first-come basis on the day, booking by phone and payment by JRA Card is required for the other 420 seats)<br/>
A-grade reserved seats (on the sixth floor of stadium, 686 seats for smokers, 2,500 yen, 432 seats are available on first-come basis on the day, booking by phone and payment by JRA Card is required for 254 seats)<br/>
</p>
<p>As the sale of tickets of special A-grade reserved seats start prior to the opening of the gate (provided that the sale is suspended 30 minutes before opening time, people can enter the Grand Swan earlier than the actual opening time of gate. However, they are not allowed to leave the zone of special A-grade reserved seats until the gate opens. </p>
<p>The price of A-grade reserved seats was lowered on October 11, 2008 from 3,000 yen to the current price. <h3>Displays and others</h3>
</p>
<p>Following the Tokyo Racecourse, Kyoto Racecourse announced that it would replace its Turf Vision, which are set on the side of goal (No. 1 device) and on the side of fourth corner (No. 2 device), with the ones equipped with high-definition displays and multiple displays (only No. 1 device). Aiming to complete it in time for the October 2007 race, the installation work continued for about ten months at the cost of 2,280 million yen. The contractor was Toshiba Lighting and Technology Corporation. A sneak preview was held on October 1 and new devices were put into operation on October 6. The outdoor display set at paddock was also replaced. 
<br/>(This one was manufactured by Mitsubishi Electronic Corporation)<br/>
</p>
<p>The size of Turf Vision at the goal side is 691.2 square meters, 10.8 meters by 64.0 meters, and is three times the size of the previous one. Its size exceeds 'Botokun' of Suminoe Boat Race Course, and it is one of the world's largest Turf Visions with multiple displays next to the one at the Tokyo Racecourse. As the distance from the screen to the stand is shorter than that of the Tokyo Racecourse, JRA is advertizing as "world's most exciting." Spectators can enjoy digital high-definition images and obtain a variety of information provided by a maximum of three screens. </p>
<p>Hong Man Choi, a Korean K-1 fighter, was used for the memorial poster of its completion. A catchphrase 'Tate 5 Hong Man Choi, Yoko 29 Hong Man Choi' (5 Hon Man Choi in height, 29 Hon Man Choi in width) was used for this poster. Also, a unit named 'Turf bijon' (literally, beauties of Turf Vision) was organized aiming to create more appeal for the new Turf Vision. The members were Reiko OKABE, Kyoko FUJIKAWA, and Nana ROKUSHA. </p>
<p>Smoking corners were set up and three automatic telling machines (ATM) came into operation on September 29. While the ATM at Hanshin Racecourse belongs to the Resona Bank, the ATM at this race Course is owned by E-net Co., Ltd. Therefore, attention is required that fees could be charged on account deposits and withdrawals of many banks. <h3>Mini-FM inside the racecourse</h3>
</p>
<p>Each radio station is broadcasted inside the racecourse using mini-FM. Frequencies of each radio station are as follows. </p>
<p>76.0 MHz: 1st Channel of Radio Nikkei<br/>

<p>A parking space for about 8,000 cars is available. A parking fee of 2,000 yen is charged for the days <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> racing is held and 1,000 yen for the days Park-Winz is held. The parking fee is discounted by 500 yen for cars that enter the parking space by 10 a.m. Motorbikes (including motorcycles) can use bicycle-parking space free of charge. <h3>Access</h3>
</p>
<p>About five minutes on foot either from the Yodo Station of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Keihan Main Line.html">Keihan Main Line</a> of Keihan Electric Railway (bound for the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Demachiyanagi Station.html">Demachiyanagi Station</a>) or the Keihan-Yodo bus stop of Uji-yodo line of Keihan City Bus or Keihan-Uji Bus and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/road/Kumiyama Notteko Bus.html">Kumiyama Notteko Bus</a>. Rapid Express trains specially stop at the Yodo Station on the days on which racing is held (they don't stop on the day of Park-WINZ). In addition, special bus service (Yodo Racecourse Line) is provided by Keihan Bus Company from the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Yamazaki Station (Kyoto Prefecture).html">Yamazaki Station</a> (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>) of the Tokaido Main Line (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/JR Kyoto Line.html">JR Kyoto Line</a>) as well as the Minase Station of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Hankyu Kyoto Main Line.html">Hankyu Kyoto Main Line</a> (the fare is 260 yen for each way). </p>
<p>Around the end of 2010, Yodo station is expected to be moved to the place near the entrance of Kyoto Racecourse and be elevated. When the time table of the Keihan Line was revised on April 16, 2006, construction work to move the down platform of the Yodo Station (for the trains bound for the Yodoyabashi Station and Nakanoshima Station) to a temporary platform was conducted from the midnight of April 15 to the early morning of April 16 as the preliminary step for the above. The ticket gates for down trains were also moved toward the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> side by about 300 meters. </p>
<p>4 km from the Oyamazaki Interchange of the Meishin Expressway. 2 km from the Kumiyama-Yodo Interchange of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/road/Keiji Bypass.html">Keiji Bypass</a>. </p>
