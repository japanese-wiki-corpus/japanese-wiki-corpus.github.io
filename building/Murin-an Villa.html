<h1>Murin-an Villa (無鄰菴)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Located in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Sakyo Ward.html">Sakyo Ward</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>, Murin-an Villa is a facility centered on a Japanese garden and is designated as a place of scenic beauty. </p>
<p><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Aritomo YAMAGATA.html">Aritomo YAMAGATA</a> had Jihee OGAWA build it as his villa in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> in 1894. The name of the garden, meaning 'garden without neighbours', stems from the fact that there was no house adjacent to "Soan" (thatched hut) in the home town of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Aritomo YAMAGATA.html">Aritomo YAMAGATA</a>. There is a tea ceremony room, a western style building and a main building on the premises. </p>
<p>The Murinan conference was held there in 1903. </p>
