<h1>Murin-an Villa (無鄰菴)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Located in Sakyo Ward, Kyoto City, Kyoto Prefecture, Murin-an Villa is a facility centered on a Japanese garden and is designated as a place of scenic beauty. </p>
<p>Aritomo YAMAGATA had Jihee OGAWA build it as his villa in Kyoto in 1894. The name of the garden, meaning 'garden without neighbours', stems from the fact that there was no house adjacent to "Soan" (thatched hut) in the home town of Aritomo YAMAGATA. There is a tea ceremony room, a western style building and a main building on the premises. </p>
<p>The Murinan conference was held there in 1903. </p>
