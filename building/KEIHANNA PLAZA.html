<p>Features<br/>
The original goal of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kansai Science City.html">Kansai Science City</a> was to create a classic academic research town. However, inspired by the fact that the driving force for recent economic development in the US was technological innovation as typified by the information and communication technology (ICT) in Silicon Valley, calls for similar economic development in Japan have grown, so new facilities combining the functions of R&D and the creation of new industries are being built throughout the country. This is a leading facility in the Hanshin Industrial Area, and also at the center of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kansai Science City.html">Kansai Science City</a>. A similar facility in Keihin Industrial Area is Yokohama Kanazawa High-Tec Center in Kanazawa Ward, Yokohama City, jointly operated by Yokohama Industrial Development Corporation and Sumitomo Life Insurance Company. </p>
