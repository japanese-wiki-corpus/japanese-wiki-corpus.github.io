<h1>Fushimi-ko Port (伏見港)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Fushimi-ko was a port categorized as a river port that once existed in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Fushimi Ward.html">Fushimi Ward</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>. Until around 1950 it was a flourishing port that linked <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and Osaka through water transportation. (WGS 84). </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>In the Azuchi-Momoyama period, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI.html">Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI</a> led river improvement projects on the Yodo-gawa River including building Taiko-zutsumi Dike and ports which linked the Uji-gawa River and the Go-kawa (Hori-kawa) River, and Sanjukkoku-bune (literally, thirty-koku Ships, which were old Japanese commercial ships) operated between Fushimi and Osaka. </p>
<p>In the Edo period, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Ryoi SUMINOKURA.html">Ryoi SUMINOKURA</a> and his son <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Soan SUMINOKURA.html">Soan SUMINOKURA</a> made the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Takase-gawa River (Kyoto Prefecture).html">Takase-gawa River</a> wider, linking Fushimi and the center of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and improving transportation further. At Fushimi-ko Port, there was a tenmajo (post station) of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">Bakufu</a> (Tokugawa Shogunate), a honjin (hostel for government officials to stop and stay), and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> houses in which <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> lords) stayed on their trips for Sankin Kotai (system of alternate attendance to Edo) duties. It is well known that <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Ryoma SAKAMOTO.html">Ryoma SAKAMOTO</a> often stayed at Teradaya, an inn at the port, at the end of the Edo period. </p>
<p>In the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period, the Lake Biwa Canal (Kamo-gawa Canal) was opened to traffic to connect Fushimi-ko Port, completing the water traffic system with operations of steamboats. Japan's first electric railcars, on the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Kyoto Electric Railway.html">Kyoto Electric Railway</a> (later Kyoto Municipal Streetcar), were established to connect Fushimi-ko Port and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>. </p>
<p>In 1929, Misu Lock Gate was built because the dikes of the Uji-gawa River were repaired to make a difference in water level between the Uji-gawa River and the Go-kawa River. </p>
<p>In the years after that, water transportation declined with the development of railways and road transportation, so in 1967, it was decided to abolish Fushimi-ko Port along with a new city plan that would reclaim land from the port for a park. Today, a miniature model of the old port facility is on display, and a sightseeing boat modeled after Jikkoku-bune (literally ten-koku boat, a type of old Japanese freight boat) operates around the area between the Go-kawa River and Misu Lock Gate along which walking trails are built. </p>
<p>In <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Fushimi Ward.html">Fushimi Ward</a>, placenames such as Kyobashi, Minamihama, Bentenhama, and Zaimoku-cho that are related to the port town still remain today. <h3>Park</h3>
