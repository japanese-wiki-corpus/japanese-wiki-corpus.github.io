<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>Yamatomune is an architectural style seen in private houses in Nara Prefecture. Yamatomune has a combination of a thatched and tiled roof on a gable. It is characterized by the beautiful contrast between the white plaster wall of a sophisticated gable and the roof. The omoya (main building) is under the high ridge of the roof, and "kamaya" (also called "kudoyadoma," a kitchen or an area with an earthen floor and a cooking stove) is under the lower ridge. </p>
