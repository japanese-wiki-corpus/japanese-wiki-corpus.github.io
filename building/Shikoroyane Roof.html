<h1>Shikoroyane Roof (錣屋根)</h1>
<p>The shikoroyane roof is a style of Japanese roof. The method of sheeting a shikoroyane roof is called shikorobuki (a method of constructing a hip-and-gable roof on separate planes). </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>The shikorobuki is a form of sheeting a two-tier roof; firstly, sheeting the roof from the omune ridge to the end of the top tier, and then to eaves, instead of sheeting a plane roof in whole. It may be interpreted as a gable roof with sheeted roofs (may be called the eaves) on all four sides but is also used in yosemune-zukuri style roofs (a square or rectangular building, covered with a hipped roof) such as that of Todai-ji Temple Nenbutsudo Hall. The roof with a gable on its top appeared the irimoya style roof. </p>
<p>The word "shikoro" refers to the fabric or lacing that was hung from the bottom of a helmet or hood in order to protect the back of the head. 
<br/>In architecture, ha-ita and yoroi-ita louver boards are called "shikoro-ita,"<br/>
`Shikorobisashi' (a pent-roof added to a main building whose roof is at a lower level than the pent-roof) is the roof boards of eaves shingled in Haita-board pattern utilizing the method of the`Shikoroita-board.'<br/>
<h3>Example</h3>
</p>
<p>Tamamushi-no-Zushi (the "Beetle Shrine") (dating from the first half of the Nara period) at Horyu-ji Temple is regarded as the one of the oldest buildings with a Shikoroyane roof. In architecture, second tier of the roof of Shitenno-ji Temple Kondo Hall in Osaka and the roof of Shishinden Hall of Kyoto Imperial Palace are in this form. </p>
