<p>The Umekoji Steam Locomotive Museum is a preservation and display facility for steam locomotives, operated by West Japan Railway Company (JR West Japan), located in Kankiji-cho, Shimogyo-ku, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>. </p>

</p>
<p>On October 10, 1972, the Japan National Railway opened a semicircular garage at the Umekoji engine yard in Shimogyou-ku, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> in celebration of the 100th anniversary of the first railway in Japan. The first of its kind, this facility preserves working steam locomotives, honoring them as precious artifacts of industrial culture that supported the Japanese rail transport system. JR West Japan took over the facility in 1987, following the breakup and privatization of Japanese National Railways. The facility itself is also an active depot (Umekoji Railyard), and carries out inspections and maintenance on steam locomotives and Japanese National Railways Diesel Locomotive Class DE10 owned by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Sagano Scenic Railway.html">Sagano Scenic Railway</a>. </p>
<p>Initially, this facility was established for working preservation of steam locomotives, which had begun disappearing rapidly in the latter half of the 1960s. The Koyama engine yard at Koyama Station in Tochigi Prefecture was the best candidate for the locomotive preservation area because it was close to the capital, but the Umekoji engine yard was chosen in 1970 for its central location in Japan and the presence of other historic spots in the area. Reviews had been made to select, in principle, lowest-numbered extant steam locomotives (#1 if possible) for preservation, but there are some steam locomotives, such as the Class C62 #2, that were not originally planned for preservation. <h3>Facilities</h3>
</p>
<p>The facilities consist of the Steam Locomotive Display Hall, taking advantage of the semicircular garage and turntable of the former Umekoji Engine Depot, and the Educational Display Gallery at the former <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Nijo Station.html">Nijo Station</a> building which was moved and rebuilt at this location. </p>
<p>The semicircular garage of reinforced concrete construction (built in 1914) was designated as an Important Cultural Property by the Japanese Government on December 10, 2004, along with its 5-ton electric ceiling crane (completed in 1915) and access rails. In 2004, it was also chosen by the Japan Society of Civil Engineers as a Public Works Heritage site. In 2006, the former <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Nijo Station.html">Nijo Station</a> building (gallery) and the semicircular garage, along with the preserved steam locomotives as well as inspection and maintenance equipment, etc. were designated as Railway Memorial Objects and Railway Semi-memorial Objects by JR West Japan. </p>
<p>The former <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Nijo Station.html">Nijo Station</a> building, built in 1904 by the Kyoto Railway Company to double as a headquarters building, is now the oldest 2-story, wooden, Japanese-style station building, and was modeled after Heian Jingu Shrine with harmony with the surrounding landscape in mind. It was used as a station building by Japanese National Railways and JR West Japan after Kyoto Railway Company was nationalized in 1907; but its use as a station building ended in 1996, following the elevation of the Sanin Line (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Sagano Line.html">Sagano Line</a>) between Nijo and Hanazono Stations (in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>), and in 1997 was rebuilt on this site to be used as an entrance, with its original indoor facilities such as ticket windows being used as a gallery. It was designated a Cultural Property of the City of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> in April 1996. </p>
<p>The semicircular garage houses and displays 18 steam locomotives (originally 17 when the facility first opened) of 16 different classes - all manufactured in Japan from the Taisho to Showa periods. When this museum opened, there was a rule that locomotives should be preserved in working conditions. In fact, 15 locomotives excluding the two (Class C53 #45 and Class C51 #239) were registered for operation. However, the scope of locomotives to be preserved has been reconsidered several times since then. As of 2006, 7 locomotives of 7 different classes are preserved in working conditions. Of those, 5 steam locomotives of 5 different classes are still registered for operation, and 2 (Class C57 #1 and Class C56 #160) are in service to pull trains on main lines such as the Yamaguchi on the Yamaguchi Line and the Kita Biwako on the Hokuriku Main Line. The others in working conditions are registered but cannot run on the main lines because they have not undergone general inspections. Also, the SL Steamliner - pulled by a locomotive being preserved in working conditions for display in the museum - is running on the tracks of the museum site. </p>
<p>This display track once stretched north from the garage to the northern edge of the grounds, where there is now a parking lot for large vehicles (where a rest facility for the museum and a park were once located). In line with relocation of the former <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Nijo Station.html">Nijo Station</a> building, it was rearranged to go through the southern edge of Umekoji Park and under the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Sagano Line.html">Sagano Line</a> tracks. </p>
<p>Today this is still a functional engine depot, and is connected to rail lines in operation. After the closing of West Japan Railway Company's Takatori Plant, the facility has also taken over maintenance of steam locomotives. <h3>Code Indicated On The Locomotives On Display</h3>

<p>All the steam locomotives, except for Class C62 #1 that was designated in 1976, were designated as Railway Semi-memorial Objects together with its logs and maintenance tools in 2006. Unless otherwise noted, the steam locomotives were transferred from the previous engine depots in 1972. Registraion of steam locomotives marked with * had been deleted when they were brought to Umekoji for preservation. </p>
