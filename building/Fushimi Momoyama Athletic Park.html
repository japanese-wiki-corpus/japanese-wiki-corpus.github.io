In the past, the Fushimi Momoyama Castle Land stood on this site, but the amusement park closed in 2003. At that time, it was planned to destroy the imitation castle tower, but the tower has remained at the request of local residents. Kyoto City then began to convert the area into an athletic park from 2004, and it opened on April 1, 2007. </p>
