<p></p>
<p>Jingu Shikinen <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Sengu.html">Sengu</a> is the Shikinen <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Sengu.html">Sengu</a> (transfer of a deity to a new shrine building once in a prescribed number of years) at <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Jingu.html">Jingu</a> (Ise-Jingu Shrine). </p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Jingu.html">Jingu</a>, every ２０ years all Shaden (the buildings) and the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Torii.html">Torii</a> (an archway to a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> shrine) of Shogu (the supreme two shrines) and Betsugu (second ranked affiliated shrines) including Kotai-jingu Shrine and Toyouke-Daijingu Shrine are rebuilt, and the Onshozoku (the sacred apparel) and Shinpo (the treasures) are remade, and they are carried to a new site along with the symbol of the kami (deities). <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Uji-bashi Bridge.html">Uji-bashi Bridge</a> was also reconstructed at the same time from the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> to early Showa period, but since the Pacific War, it has been rebuilt four years before Shikinen <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Sengu.html">Sengu</a>. </p>
<p>The first Shikinen <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Sengu.html">Sengu</a> was performed in 690, in the time of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Empress Jito.html">Empress Jito</a>, and since then, with only a few exceptions such as during the Sengoku period (period of warring states), has been conducted once every 20 years (there were some postponements), and the 61st Shikinen <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Sengu.html">Sengu</a> was conducted in 1993. </p>
<p>Ceremonies for the 62nd Shikinen <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Sengu.html">Sengu</a> have been performed since 2005, and the Seisengu (transfer of the symbol of the kami) is scheduled for 2013<br/>
</p>
<p><h3>Significance of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Sengu.html">Sengu</a> (transfer of a deity to a new shrine building)</h3>
</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Sengu.html">Sengu</a> is conducted because the buildings need reconstructing as they get old. </p>
<p>Plain wood hottatebashira (pillars) and thatched roofs do not last long. </p>
<p>However, in Tenmucho (the period of Emperor Tenmu) when the system of Shikinen <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Sengu.html">Sengu</a> was established, Horyu-ji Temple, of which original and rebuilt structures exist, was built. </p>
<p>Considering the national strength and the level of technological development at that time it would have been possible to build <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Jingu.html">Jingu</a> structures that survived to date. </p>
<p>Although there are no definite records at the shrine relating to why they dared to spend a huge amount of the nation's power to conduct Shikinen <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Sengu.html">Sengu</a>, the following four reasons are given:<br/>
</p>
<p>They recognized the value of preserving Yayoi architecture which was already becoming obsolete at that time. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> valued the renewal of mind which constantly purified the spirit, called 'Tokowaka' (forever young). In other words, they thought that the aging of the buildings meant that '<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Kegare.html">kegare</a>' (weakening) would dissipate the vital energy endowed by the kami, so their reconstruction would also renew the energy of the kami to make the people full of energy again. </p>
<p>The first Daijo-sai ceremony (a festival to celebrate the succession of an emperor) was conducted in the period of Emperor Tenmu. This was the major shrine ceremony conducted only once in the reign of the Emperor, in contrast to the annual Niiname-sai (offering of the First Fruits to the kami) by the Emperor. As a result of this, the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Sengu.html">Sengu</a> was performed as the 'Okanname-sai' (grand Kanname-sai) ceremony in contrast to the annual Kanname-sai ceremony (an offering of firstfruits of the harvest to the Ise deities by the emperor). </p>
<p>Each Emperor had a new Imperial Palace built for himself prior to Emperor Tenmu, but since a permanent capital (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Fujiwara-kyo.html">Fujiwara-kyo</a>) was built, the values of the renewal of the capital were maintained through the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Sengu.html">Sengu</a> of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Jingu.html">Jingu</a>. </p>
<p>Likewise, there are no definitive records as to why Shikinen <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Sengu.html">Sengu</a> has been conducted every 20 years, but the following possible reasons are given:<br/>
</p>
<p>As mentioned above, buildings were thought to keep their 'purity' for about 20 years. 
<br/>(They would of course be usable for a much longer time.)<br/>
</p>
<p>This 20-year interval was appropriate when the passing on of the techniques of reconstruction through the generations is considered. 
<br/>(Workers were footmen or apprentices in their teens and twenties, mid-career or master carpenters in their thirties and forties, and tutelages in their fifties.)<br/>
</p>
<p>In the lunar calendar, 'Sakutantoji' (the winter solstice on the 1st of the eleventh month) comes around once in 19 or 20 years (Metonic cycle). </p>
<p>20 years can be considered an appropriate period to mark the sections of an individual's life or changes in society. </p>
<p>An aspect of the Okanname-sai within the Shikinen <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Sengu.html">Sengu</a> is the use of grain, and the shelf life of grain is 20 years. <h3>Timber</h3>
</p>
<p>In order to perform the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Sengu.html">Sengu</a> more than 10,000 Japanese cypress trees are needed. </p>
<p>Until the thirty-fourth Shikinen <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Sengu.html">Sengu</a> the source of the timber had always been the forest (called Miso-yama) on Mt. Kamiji or Mt. Takakura located behind the Naiku (inner shrine) and Geku (outer shrine), with three exceptions when the trees came from neighboring mountains. </p>
<p>After this time, the timber for the Naiku was taken from Mikawa Province after the 35th Shikinen <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Sengu.html">Sengu</a>, and the timber for the Geku came from Mino Province after the 36th Shikinen <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Sengu.html">Sengu</a>, with the exception of Osugi-dani Valley, Ise Province between the 41st and 46th Shikinen <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Sengu.html">Sengu</a>. </p>
<p>This region was the territory of the Kishu Domain which was one of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/family/Tokugawa Gosanke (three privileged branches of the Tokugawa family).html">Tokugawa Gosanke</a> (three privileged branches of the Tokugawa family) in the Edo period. </p>
<p>However, because it became difficult to log the forest due to the depletion of raw wood in this region, Miso-yama was moved to Kiso-dani Valley which was in Owari Domain, also one of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/family/Tokugawa Gosanke (three privileged branches of the Tokugawa family).html">Tokugawa Gosanke</a>, after the 47th Shikinen <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Sengu.html">Sengu</a>, and it has stayed there ever since (only once returning to Osugi-dani Valley for the 51st Shikinen <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Sengu.html">Sengu</a>). </p>
<p>The forest belonging to the Owari Domain was nationalized after the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Meiji Restoration (Meiji-ishin).html">Meiji Restoration</a>, and Jingubirin (resource forests for the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Jingu.html">Jingu</a>) were set up in Akazawa Natural Recreation Forest and other areas during the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> and Taisho periods, with a systematic afforestation program making it possible to stably supply 200 to 300 year-old timber. </p>
<p>They are still the main suppliers of the timber for the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Sengu.html">Sengu</a>, although the designation of Jingubirin was halted after the Second World War. </p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Jingu.html">Jingu</a> made a forest management plan in 1923, after which they have continued planting Japanese cypress since the end of the Taisho period (1925 or 1926) in an attempt to lay Miso-yama again in Mt. Kamiji, Mt. Shimaji, and Mt. Takakura. </p>
<p>Because Japanese cypress needs at least 200 years to grow tall enough to be logged, this is a far-reaching program where logging is expected to begin in 120 years (2125) and for it to be the main source of timber only in the 25th century. </p>
<p>However, they plan to use thinned wood for various parts covering twenty-five percent of the total for the sixty-second <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Sengu.html">Sengu</a>. </p>
<p>The materials from the old buildings will be recycled and used to build or repair the Sessha (auxiliary shrine) and Massha (affiliated sub-shrines) inside the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Jingu.html">Jingu</a> and other shrines across the country. The Naiku Goshoden Munamochi-bashira (the main pillars of the Naiku) will be re-used to rebuild the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Torii.html">Torii</a> at Ujibashi Jingu Shrine next time, and also will be used for the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Torii.html">Torii</a> of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Higashi (dry sweets; dry confectionary).html">Higashi</a> no Oiwake at Sekijuku. The Geku Goshoden Munamochi-bashira (the main pillars of the Geku) will be used to rebuild the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Torii.html">Torii</a> on the Ujibashi Oharai-machi side next time, and also for the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Torii.html">Torii</a> at Shichiri no Watashi at Kuwanajuku. <h3>Rituals and events</h3>
</p>
<p>(The schedule of the 61st Shikinen <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Sengu.html">Sengu</a> is on the left side, and that of the 62nd Shikinen <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Sengu.html">Sengu</a> currently underway is on the right; blank means undecided. 
<br/>The dates marked "*"are called "Gojijo", which will be decided by the Emperor.)<br/>
<h3>山口祭</h3>
</p>
<p>Yamaguchi-sai<br/>
</p>
<p>May 2, 1985/May 2, 2005*<br/>
</p>
<p>This is the first ceremony in the series of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Sengu.html">Sengu</a> ceremonies. It is to offer prayers to the kami who resides at the foot of Miso-yama where the wood is to be cut. </p>
<p>Although the timber is cut in the mountains of Kiso, this ceremony is conducted at the foot of Mt. Kamiji for the Naiku, and at Mt. Takakura for the Geku, as it was conducted in ancient times. <h3>木本祭</h3>
</p>
<p>Konomoto-sai<br/>
</p>
<p>May 2, 1985/May 2, 2005*<br/>
</p>
<p>This ceremony is to offer prayers to the kami who dwells in the tree of which the core pillar is made. </p>
<p>It is conducted in secret late in the night. <h3>御杣始祭</h3>
</p>
<p>Misoma-hajime-sai<br/>
</p>
<p>June 3, 1985/June 3, 2005<br/>
</p>
<p>This is the event to cut the wood which is to be used to make the Mihishiro (the sacred box to hold the symbol of the kami). </p>
<p>It will be conducted in Agematsu-machi, Nagano Prefecture as it was last time. </p>
<p>The wood is cut in the ancient manner called 'Mitsuogiri (or Mitsuhimogiri).'<br/>
</p>
<p>In the ceremony, a tree for the Naiku and another for the Geku are cut in this order. Traditionally, these two trees are cut down so that they cross on the ground. <h3>裏木曽御用材伐採式</h3>
</p>
<p>Urakiso-goyozai Bassai-shiki<br/>
</p>
<p>June 5, 1985/June 5, 2005<br/>
</p>
<p>The trees for Mihishiro are also cut in Urakiso where prayers are offered for safety during the work. </p>
<p>It will be conducted in Nakatsugawa City, Gifu Prefecture (in what was Kashimo-mura) as it was last time. </p>
<p>The order of the ceremony is the same as that of Misoma-hajime-sai. <h3>御樋代木奉曳式</h3>
</p>
<p>Mihishirogi-hoei-shiki<br/>
</p>
<p>Naiku: June 10, 1985/ June 9, 2005; Geku: June 11, 1985/June 10, 2005<br/>
</p>
<p>This is the ceremonial transport of the materials for the Mihishiro (including the two spare materials for both Naiku and Geku) that have been brought to Ise to each Gojoden in the Naiku and Geku. </p>
<p>For the Naiku, they are carried on Kizori (wooden sledges) through the Isuzu-gawa River from behind Mie Prefectural Gymnasium to Kazahinomino Miya-hashi Bridge in the Naiku compound. 
<br/>(This is called 'Kawabiki' (literally, pulling via the river).)<br/>
</p>
<p>For the Geku, they are carried on Hoeisha (wheeled carriages) from Watarai-bashi Bridge on the Miya-gawa River across the city to the Geku. 
<br/>(This is called 'Okabiki' (literally, pulling over land).)<br/>
More precisely, the part of the ceremony in the urban area is 'Hoei Gyoji' (the ceremonial offering of the transportation of the timber) hosted by Hoei Honbu (the local community group for the event), and 'Hoei-shiki' is the ceremony conducted by the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Jingu.html">Jingu</a> of the transport of the materials from the Kitamikado of the Geku to Gojoden. <h3>繰り糸はじめ式</h3>
</p>
<p>Kuriitohajime-shiki<br/>
</p>
<p>Unknown/July 8, 2005<br/>
</p>
<p>This ceremony is conducted at a silk thread factory in Seiyo City, Ehime Prefecture to start producing raw silk for the sacred treasures and apparel. <h3>御船代祭</h3>
</p>
<p>Mifunashiro-sai<br/>
</p>
<p>Naiku: September 17, 1985/September 17, 2005; Geku: September 19, 1985/September 19, 2005*<br/>
</p>
<p>This is the ceremony for cutting the materials for the Mifunashiro (which is shaped like a ship), the wooden box to hold the Mihishiro of both the Shogu and Betsugu shrines in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Jingu.html">Jingu</a>. </p>
<p>After Sanshin and Shubatsu, the main ceremony is conducted at Miya-yama-saijo (Naiku: at the southeast side of Kazahinominomiya-hashi Bridge; Geku: at the east side of Tsuchi no Miya Shrine). </p>
<p>The most important procedure is when the 'Monoimi' (物忌), a boy designated 'Oguna' for the Naiku and a girl designated 'Warawame' for the Geku cut twigs with a hatchet. </p>
<p>The timber for this is cut in Kiso (in the case of the Naiku) and in Urakiso (for the Geku) for the occasion of this ceremony. <h3>御装束神宝御料織初式</h3>
</p>
<p>Onshozoku-shinpogoryo Orizome-shiki<br/>
</p>
<p>(Unknown)/November 9, 2005<br/>
</p>
<p>This ceremony consisting of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Norito (Shinto prayer).html">Norito</a> (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> prayer), <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Gagaku.html">Gagaku</a> (traditional court music), and Kiyomeharae (a purifying procedure) is conducted at a textile factory in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamigyo Ward.html">Kamigyo Ward</a> of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a> to start weaving the sacred treasures and apparel. <h3>御木曳初式</h3>
</p>
<p>Okihiki-zome-shiki<br/>
</p>
<p>Naiku and its Betsugu shrines: April 12, 1986/April 12, 2006 (April 16 for the two shrines of Takiharamiya, and Izawanomiya); Geku and its Betsugu shrines: April 13, 1986/April 13, 2006<br/>
</p>
<p>As the ceremony marking the start of pulling the timber into the sanctuary, special 'Shinryomin' (people who live on the land once owned by the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Jingu.html">Jingu</a> before the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period) transport the important wood (called 'Yakugi') such as for the rafters of the main shrines of both the Naiku and Geku. Until the sixty-first <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Sengu.html">Sengu</a> the phrase 'Munamochi-bashira and others' had been used, but it has been announced that the sixty-second <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Sengu.html">Sengu</a> will not include Munamochi-bashira (outer supporting pillars for the shrine building). </p>
<p>Three Yakugi are required by each part of the Shogu (Naiku and Geku), and one Yakugi for each of the Betsugu shrines. </p>
<p>This ceremony is almost the same as Mihishirogi-hoei-shiki with the following differences:<br/>
</p>
<p>The wood is pulled into the Naiku compound from Mitarashiba. </p>
<p>When the wood is raised from the Miya-gawa River, a procedure called 'Donden' where the timber is drained of water is conducted in the traditional manner. </p>
<p>Because the Yakugi for the Betsugu must be carried into the sacred area, workers carry them on their shoulders at the end of the journey. They are carried on sledges or wheeled carriages to the Betsugu of the Naiku outside the precincts. </p>
<p>The wheeled carriage and Kiyariuta (song) are unique to each section of the journey. </p>
<p>This ceremony is also called 'Yakugibiki' (literally, towing of Yakugi). </p>
<p>木造始祭<br/>
</p>

<p>Although the timber for the Naiku is traditionally pulled by Kawabiki, on some exceptional courses Okabiki is conducted for some historical reasons. </p>
<p>The residents of Iso-cho, which used to be a domain of Keikoin who was credited with re-establishing the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Sengu.html">Sengu</a>, perform the Okabiki of the wood for the Tobiragi (wood for doors) of the Naiku from the Miya-gawa River via the Geku and Yamatohimenomiya to Naiku Uji workshop. 
<br/>This is also called 'Keikoinbiki' (literally, pulling via Keikoin)<br/>
</p>
