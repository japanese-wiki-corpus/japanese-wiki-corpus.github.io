<h1>Kyoraku-koen Park (共楽公園)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kyoraku-koen Park is located in the center of the Naka-Maizuru area, which is placed almost in the center of Maizuru City in Kyoto Prefecture. </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>It is located on a small hill at a height of approximately 47 m above sea level. </p>
<p>Approximately 800 cherry trees, including Someiyoshino cherries and Yamazakura cherries, are planted all over the hill, and they bloom in spring so that the entire hill is covered in pink. <h3>Aloha Zakura Cherry</h3>
</p>
<p>After the Second World War, a second-generation Japanese-American at the General Headquarters of the Allied Powers purchased cherry saplings, with a fund prepared for his parents, to invigorate the devastated city and its citizens. However, instructed about a job relocation unexpectedly, he left Maizuru without any chance of planting them. </p>
<p>It is said that, after that, his colleagues and citizens of the city planted the saplings left at a railway station and the cherries have come to be called 'Aloha zakura cherry.'<br/>
