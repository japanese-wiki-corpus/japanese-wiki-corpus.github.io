<h1>Kurokabe Square (黒壁スクエア)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kurokabe Square (also known as "Kurokabe" [black walls]), located in the old town area of Nagahama City in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Shiga Prefecture.html">Shiga Prefecture</a>, is a sightseeing spot where the traditional buildings are preserved effectively. 
<br/>Kurokabe Square is the collective name for the black-plaster-wall Japanese-style buildings from 'Kurokabe 1st' to 'Kurokabe 3rd.'<br/>
It is generally introduced as the area centering on the intersection of Hokkoku-kaido Road and Otemon Street (Mino-tanigumi-kaido Road) where is known as 'Fudanotsuji,' whose name originated from the fact that the board called "kousatsu" was erected on the place for the official announcements during the Edo period. </p>
<p>The streets, lined with the attached Japanese-style buildings of the Edo and the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> periods, preserve the streetscape continuity and the atmosphere of the periods. There are restaurants, cafes, and cultural facilities, such as museums, galleries, and art glass studios utilizing the historic streetscape and the old buildings. This area is packed with such facilities. This area is also famous as the place where Japan's largest collection of glassworks are held. Approximately three million people visit this most popular sightseeing spot in Kohoku area annually. </p>
<p>History<br/>
Former Dai Hyakusanju Bank (the completion of construction was 1899), popularly known as 'Kurokabe Bank,' is at 'Fudanotsuji,' where is the center of the old town area. When the building was facing the threat of demolition, the third sector, 'Kurokabe,' a joint venture of Nagahama City and eight local private companies, was established in 1988, holding up the museum city concept to preserve and renovate the old buildings in the old town area. </p>
<p>The primary purpose of establishing the company, 'Kurokabe,' was to preserve and renovate the former Dai Hyakusanju Bank. The purpose was achieved when the building was opened as Kurokabe 1st, 'the Kurokabe Glass Shop,' in 1989. </p>
<p>The company renovated ten old buildings stood around the Kurokabe 1st into museums, glass shops, studios, galleries, cafes, and restaurants one after another. Including the other buildings which joined the 'Kurokabe town planning,' the company engaged in the renovation of a total of thirty old buildings. The Special Rapid train was extended to Nagahama station in 1991. This contributed to an increase in the number of tourists visiting the area and helped to promote the renovation and utilization of the other old buildings remained in the area. </p>
<p>The deserted shopping arcades and the old residential streets supported by 400-year tradition are now transformed into the largest sightseeing spot in the Kohoku area. As the place is famous for the successful example of town revitalization, there are always many visitors from everywhere in Japan. </p>
