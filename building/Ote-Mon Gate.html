<h1>Ote-Mon Gate (大手門)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>An ote-mon gate is a gate constructed at the most important entrance of a Japanese castle that leads to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Kuruwa (Castle compound).html">kuruwa</a> (walls of a castle) such as a ninomaru (second bailey) and a sannomaru (outer part of the castle). It refers to a main gate. For some castles, such as the Kochi-jo Castle, Ote-mon gate (大手門) is expressed as an ote-mon gate (追手門) in Chinese characters. </p>
<p>An ote-mon gate is often constructed for heavy security, constructed as a yagura-mon gate (literally, turret gate), and is square-shaped built on a stone mound. It is large and in fact is built to be seen. Its bridge is often an earth-paved bridge. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, a gate built at backside of a castle is called a karamete-mon gate. </p>
