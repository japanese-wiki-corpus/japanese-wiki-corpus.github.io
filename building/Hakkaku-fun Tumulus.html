<h1>Hakkaku-fun Tumulus (八角墳)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Hakkaku-fun is a regular octagonal tumulus constructed during the end of the Kofun period (around the mid seventh century). Well known tumuli of this type are Gobyono-kofun Tumulus (present-day Tumulus of the Emperor Tenji) in Kyoto City, and Noguchino Ono-haka-kofun Tumulus (present-day Joint Tumulus of the Emperor Tenmu and the Empress Jito) in Asuka-mura, Takaichi-gun, Nara Prefecture. </p>
<p><h3>Meaning of Octagonal Tumuli</h3>
</p>
<p>The octagonal tumuli are considered to have been made based on the idea that the octagon suits a king who shows his ruling power in eight (all) directions of the world, which came from Chinese political philosophy in general. </p>
<p>The octagonal tumuli are included in the dead end types of tumulus in its history according to Koichi MORI. Although some archaeologists indicate that they were possibly dedicated to enthroned kings, many doubt that they were only for enthroning kings, because similar tumuli, if in a small number, were discovered not only in Nara Prefecture, but also in the eastern part of Japan, such as at Inarizuka-kofun Tumulus in Tama City, Tokyo Prefecture. </p>
<p>The Emperor Jomei's tomb is thought to have been the first octagonal tumulus, so one can assume that a unique type of tumulus for the kings of Yamato was invented. It was to declare the king as the top ruler different from other local powerful lords of clans, with the aim of establishing a nation of centralized governance structure. <h3>Recent Excavations</h3>
</p>
<p>On April 19, 2006, news media reported that a group of twenty-four buried tombs of the seventh century was detected in the Kuwanohara-kofun Tumuli of Kuwanohara-iseki Ruins in Ibaraki City, Osaka Prefecture, and an archaeologist remarked one of them was octagonal and might be NAKATOMI no Kamatari's tomb. <h3>Significant Tumuli</h3>
