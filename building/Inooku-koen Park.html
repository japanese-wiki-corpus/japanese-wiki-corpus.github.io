<h3>Facilities in the Park</h3>
</p>
<p>Covering a vast area of about 7.8 ha, particular emphasis has been put on the scenery of its woods and riverside, and zones called 'Mirai' (future), '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Satoyama.html">Satoyama</a>' (woodland in a village), and 'Shinryoku' (greenery) have been created around the regulating reservoir which controls the amount of rainwater that feeds into the river. <h3>Mirai' Zone</h3>
</p>
<p>This zone is equipped with lamps powered by solar and wind energy, and has grassy open spaces, and fountains and streams where one can enjoy touching the water. <h3><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Satoyama.html">Satoyama</a>' Zone</h3>
</p>
<p>This zone has a walking trail in a natural forest and a biotope pond that together provide a good environment for observing living creatures and listening to birds sing. <h3>Shinryoku' Zone</h3>
</p>
<p>It has a very popular sixty-four meter long slide in the adventure playground here. Those playing here can feel safe using the equipment because they are designed to have a gently curving shape. </p>
