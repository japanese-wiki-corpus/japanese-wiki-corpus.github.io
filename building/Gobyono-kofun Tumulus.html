<h1>Gobyono-kofun Tumulus (御廟野古墳)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Gobyono-kofun is a tumulus built at the end of the Kofun period (Hakkaku-fun Tumulus (an octagonal tomb)) located in Yamashina-ku Ward of Kyoto City. </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>There is no doubt that this is the tumulus of an Emperor who was a real person in history, in other words, this tomb can be called 'the Imperial mausoleum of Emperor Tenchi.'<br/>
This kind of identified tomb is extremely rare; the only other example is Noguchi no O no Haka Tumulus, the joint tumulus of the Emperor Tenmu and the Empress Jito. </p>
<p>Only tombs of major kings were octagonal during the middle of the seventh century. Tombs of horizontally octagonal mounds that have been found are: Dannozuka-kofun Tumulus (present-day Jomei-ryo Tumulus) in Sakurai City of Nara Prefecture; Noguchi no O no Haka Tumulus (Joint Tumulus of the Emperor Tenmu and the Empress Jito) in Asuka-mura, Takaichi-gun, Nara Prefecture; Nakaoyama-kofun Tumulus which is commonly thought to be Monbu-ryo Tumulus in Asuka-mura, Nara Prefecture; and the Gobyono-kofun Tumulus. This fact shows that a unique type of tumulus for Kings in Japan, was invented for the first time in history. </p>
<p>Other tombs that follow, may be octagonal: Tsukamyojin-kofun Tumulus (likely to be Mayumiyama-ryo Tumulus of Prince Kusakabe) in Takatori-cho, Takaichi-gun, Nara prefecture; and Iwayayama-kofun Tumulus (likely to be Saimei-ryo Tumulus) which probably consist of an octagonal mound. </p>
