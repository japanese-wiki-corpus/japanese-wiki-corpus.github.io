<h1>Gobyono-kofun Tumulus (御廟野古墳)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Gobyono-kofun is a tumulus built at the end of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kofun period (tumulus period).html">Kofun period</a> (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Hakkaku-fun Tumulus.html">Hakkaku-fun Tumulus</a> (an octagonal tomb)) located in Yamashina-ku Ward of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>. </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>There is no doubt that this is the tumulus of an Emperor who was a real person in history, in other words, this tomb can be called 'the Imperial <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Mausoleum.html">mausoleum</a> of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Tenchi (Tenji).html">Emperor Tenchi</a>.'<br/>
This kind of identified tomb is extremely rare; the only other example is Noguchi no O no Haka Tumulus, the joint tumulus of the Emperor Tenmu and the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Empress Jito.html">Empress Jito</a>. </p>
<p>Only tombs of major kings were octagonal during the middle of the seventh century. Tombs of horizontally octagonal mounds that have been found are: Dannozuka-kofun Tumulus (present-day Jomei-ryo Tumulus) in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Sakurai City.html">Sakurai City</a> of Nara Prefecture; Noguchi no O no Haka Tumulus (Joint Tumulus of the Emperor Tenmu and the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Empress Jito.html">Empress Jito</a>) in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Asuka-mura (Asuka Village).html">Asuka-mura</a>, Takaichi-gun, Nara Prefecture; Nakaoyama-kofun Tumulus which is commonly thought to be Monbu-ryo Tumulus in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Asuka-mura (Asuka Village).html">Asuka-mura</a>, Nara Prefecture; and the Gobyono-kofun Tumulus. This fact shows that a unique type of tumulus for Kings in Japan, was invented for the first time in history. </p>
<p>Other tombs that follow, may be octagonal: Tsukamyojin-kofun Tumulus (likely to be Mayumiyama-ryo Tumulus of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Prince Kusakabe.html">Prince Kusakabe</a>) in Takatori-cho, Takaichi-gun, Nara prefecture; and Iwayayama-kofun Tumulus (likely to be Saimei-ryo Tumulus) which probably consist of an octagonal mound. </p>
