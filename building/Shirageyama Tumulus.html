<h1>Shirageyama Tumulus (白米山古墳)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Shirageyama Tumulus is a keyhole-shaped tomb mound located in Yosano-cho, Yosa-gun, Kyoto Prefecture. </p>
<p>Summary<br/>
The 92 m-long and 5 m-high tumulus, built around the fourth century, is the oldest keyhole-shaped tomb mound on the Japan Sea side<br/>
The tumulus is two-tiered. Although no Haniwa (unglazed terra-cotta cylinders and hollow sculptures arranged on and around the mounded tombs or kofun) is found there, some fuki-ishi (stones covering an old tomb) still remain. </p>
