<h1>Sumiyoshi-zukuri style (住吉造)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Sumiyoshi-zukuri style is one of the architectural styles of shrines in Japan. </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>Sumiyoshi-zukuri style, which is typified by Sumiyoshi-taisha Shrine, is characterized by its ancient linear hafu (a barge board), and many have pointed out its resemblance to the building constructed in the Daijo-sai festival (a festival to celebrate the succession of an emperor). It is one of the oldest architectural styles of shrines, along with shinmei-zukuri style, which is exemplified by Ise-jingu Shrine, and taisha-zukuri style, which is epitomized by Izumo-taisha Shrine. <h3>Structures</h3>
</p>
<p>Sumiyoshi-zukuri style architecture has no veranda (a narrow wooden passageway along the edge of a house facing the garden) or the sacred core pillar installed at the center of the main sanctuary of a shrine, and the inside is divided into a naijin (inner sanctuary of a shrine or temple) and a gejin (part of the main sanctuary outside the innermost sanctum of a shrine). It is rectangular with a width of approx. 3.6 meters and a depth of approx. 7.3 meters, approx. 3.6 meters each for the naijin and gejin. </p>
<p>The structure of sumiyoshi-zukuri style employs kirizuma-zukuri style (an architectural style with a gabled roof) with a Tsuma-iri (entrance on the gable side), and its planar working gives a linear outlook. <h3>Roofs</h3>
</p>
<p>The roofs are not necessarily thatched; there are wide varieties, from kokerabuki (a roof covering made with a layer of thin wooden shingles made of cypress) to hiwadabuki (cypress bark roof). </p>
<p>The hafu of Sumiyoshi-taisha Shrine is linear-shaped, and the embellishment of gable pediments is 交叉合掌型. </p>
<p>Pillars<br/>
</p>
<p>The architecture is approx. 3.6 meters wide and approx. 7.3 meters deep without the sacred core pillar installed at the center of the main sanctuary of a shrine, or pillars at the center on the front. </p>
<p>Walls<br/>
</p>
<p>A double-door opening is provided at one location, at the center on the front. </p>
<p>Floors<br/>
</p>
<p>The floor is lower than those of taisha-zukuri style and shinmei-zukuri style. </p>
