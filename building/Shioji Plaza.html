<h1>Shioji Plaza (しおじプラザ)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Shioji Plaza is a seaside park on the beachside of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Maizuru City.html">Maizuru City</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>. The construction of the first section was completed in 1993. </p>
<p>Shioji Plaza is a park on the beachside, close to the center of Higashi-maizuru district. About 3,000 flowers and trees such as tsutsuji azaleas and satsuki azaleas have been planted in the area of approximately 3,500m² from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Sanjo-dori Street.html">Sanjo-dori Street</a> (disambiguation) to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Gojo-dori Street.html">Gojo-dori Street</a>. </p>
<p>Many people enjoy taking a walk and viewing the trees and flowers in the park. Also the park has bronze sculptures and benches. When the weather is good, one can enjoy the view of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Maejima Wharf (前島埠頭).html">Maejima Wharf</a> and ferries depart and arrive by as well as the mountains in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Oura Peninsula.html">Oura Peninsula</a> over the sea, which has been a good spot to relax for many people. </p>
<p>Also in the center of the park, there is a monument of a large anchor, which was built before World War II to moor a beacon. The monument weighs about four tons, and was borrowed from the Maritime Self-Defense Force and placed there by the city as the symbol of the park. </p>
<p>There is a landing place on the quay for Maizuru Port Pleasure Boats which cruise Maizuru Bay. </p>
<p>Incidentally, there is a plan to install a pedestrian overpass connecting the park to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Maejima Wharf (前島埠頭).html">Maejima Wharf</a>, which has a ferry landing place, as the second phase of the construction, however, the outlook for the construction is still uncertain. </p>
