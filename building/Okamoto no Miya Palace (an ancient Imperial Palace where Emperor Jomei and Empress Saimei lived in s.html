<h1>Okamoto no Miya Palace (an ancient Imperial Palace where <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Jomei.html">Emperor Jomei</a> and Empress Saimei lived in seventh century) (岡本宮)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Okamoto no Miya was an Imperial Palace in which <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Jomei.html">Emperor Jomei</a> and Empress Saimei lived in the seventh century. Okamoto no Miya Palace is called by different names; the Palace of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Jomei.html">Emperor Jomei</a> is called <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Asuka (飛鳥 in Chinese characters, the name of present-day Asuka Village, Nara Prefecture).html">Asuka</a> no Okamoto no Miya and that of Empress Saimei Nochi no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Asuka (飛鳥 in Chinese characters, the name of present-day Asuka Village, Nara Prefecture).html">Asuka</a> no Okamoto no Miya. Both are deemed to have been located at the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Asuka-kyo (the Capital of Asuka).html">Asuka-kyo</a> (the capital of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Asuka (飛鳥 in Chinese characters, the name of present-day Asuka Village, Nara Prefecture).html">Asuka</a>) Site in Oka, Asuka Village, Nara Prefecture. </p>
<p><h3>Okamoto no Miya of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Jomei.html">Emperor Jomei</a></h3>
</p>
<p><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Jomei.html">Emperor Jomei</a> ascended the throne in February 629 and moved the Palace to the foot of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Asuka (飛鳥 in Chinese characters, the name of present-day Asuka Village, Nara Prefecture).html">Asuka</a> no oka Hill (also known as Ikazuchi no oka [The Thunder's Hill]) naming it Okamoto no Miya in November in the following year (630). </p>
<p>Six years later in July 636, Okamoto no Miya was destroyed by fire and so <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Jomei.html">Emperor Jomei</a> decided to move into Tanaka no Miya Palace (the present Tanaka Town, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kashihara City.html">Kashihara City</a>). <h3>Nochi no Okamoto no Miya of Empress Saimei</h3>
</p>
<p>In the winter in 655, Itabuki no Miya Palace was destroyed by fire and Empress Saimei moved into Kawahara no Miya Palace. At the same time, a new Palace site was selected, and in the following year (656), a new Palace was built in Okamoto. This was Nochi no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Asuka (飛鳥 in Chinese characters, the name of present-day Asuka Village, Nara Prefecture).html">Asuka</a> no Okamoto no Miya. As Empress Saimei was the widow of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Jomei.html">Emperor Jomei</a>, she consequently selected the site of the old Palace of her late husband. </p>
<p>However, this new Palace was also burnt down in the same year. In those days, Empress Saimei carried on many construction projects such as building stone mounds and a Takadono (a building placed on the high place) near the top of Mt. Tonomine and digging a waterway through the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Nara Basin.html">Nara Basin</a>, but these constructions were received unfavorably by the people who were mobilized. Some say that the fires mentioned on the above were caused by arsons. 
<br/>(In view of the fact that many of the palaces in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Asuka (飛鳥 in Chinese characters, the name of present-day Asuka Village, Nara Prefecture).html">Asuka</a> period were destroyed by fire, there is an opinion that when the people were strongly dissatisfied with the government, they expressed their wishes by setting fire to the imperial palaces.)<br/>
<h3>Name</h3>
</p>
<p>The name, 'Okamoto no Miya' derives from the fact that it was literally located at the foot of the Oka (a hill) (Ikazuchi no oka Hill). </p>
