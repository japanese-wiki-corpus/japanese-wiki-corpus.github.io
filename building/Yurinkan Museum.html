<h1>Yurinkan Museum (藤井斉成会有鄰館)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The Yurinkan Museum, located in Okazaki, Sakyo Ward, Kyoto City, is a private facility that is mainly dedicated to ancient Chinese art works. </p>
<p>The Fujii Saiseikai Foundation was founded in 1926 to store and exhibit the Oriental art collections of Zensuke FUJII (1873-1943) from Shiga Prefecture, who was the founder of Fujii Boseki (later, Fujii, a textile company). It is among the private art museums that were opened in the earliest stage of their history in Japan. Its three-story building is registered with Kyoto City as a cultural property; its Oriental exhibition hall topped with a red-lacquered octagonal tower has been there since its establishment, while the interior retains the atmosphere of the early Showa period. </p>
<p>The collection has many different kinds of art works, including one national treasure, nine national important cultural properties, bronze pieces, Buddha statues, paintings, calligraphy, porcelains and ceramics. A well-known rare item in the collection is an undergarment that was allegedly used to cheat at the Kakyo Examination. It is open to the public just two days per month (first and third Sundays) from 12:00 noon to 3:00 p.m., and is closed in January, August and December. </p>
