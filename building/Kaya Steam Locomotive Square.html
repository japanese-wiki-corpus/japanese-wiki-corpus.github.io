<h1>Kaya Steam Locomotive Square (加悦SL広場)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Located in Kaya, Yosano-cho, Kyoto Prefecture, Kaya Steam Locomotive Square is a facility run by Kaya Kosan Co. Ltd. to preserve and exhibit railway cars. It opened in September 1977 to exhibit mainly rail cars that were used by the Kaya Railway. It had been located in the place where Kaya Station used to stand, but since the company decided to sell its station site to former Kaya-cho in 1993, it moved the facility to the site where Oe Yama Kozan Station used to be, and resumed its business in November, 1996. </p>
