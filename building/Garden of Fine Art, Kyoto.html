<h1>Garden of Fine Art, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> (京都府立陶板名画の庭)</h1>
<p>Garden of Fine Art, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> is an outdoor art museum exhibiting ceramic plates on which great pictures of all ages are copied, located in Shimogamo, Sakyo-ku Ward, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>. </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>Based on a positive film on which an original picture has been photographed, its porcelain panel painted version is generated by copying the photograph onto a ceramic plate using a photo-engraving technique and then by baking the plate. From the nature of the plate material, the copied painting does not discolor nor does it erode, making it possible to keep it for a long period of time. The pictures are made on more than one ceramic plate. </p>
<p>The museum is the first in the world as an art-exhibiting facilities of this kind. </p>
<p>Eight great worldly renown pictures are selected and exhibited there, of which four were originally created for The International Garden and Greenery Exposition, Osaka, Japan, in 1990 and were exhibited in the "Garden of Fine Art" pavilion designed by Tadao ANDO. The remaining four were created for this facility. </p>
<p>The porcelain panel versions of the paintings were made at the Sigaraki factory of Otsuka Ohmi Ceramics Co., Ltd. </p>
<p>These porcelain panel paintings, originally owned by Shinji KAYAMORI, a director of Daikoku Denki, were donated by Kayamori to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a> based on a plan and proposal of Taichi SAKAIYA. </p>
<p>The construction of the open air facility based upon the design of Tadao ANDO was completed in March 1994. <h3>The Pictures Exhibited</h3>
