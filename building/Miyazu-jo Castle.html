<h1>Miyazu-jo Castle (宮津城)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Miyazu-jo Castle is located in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Miyazu City.html">Miyazu City</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>. </p>
<p><h3>History</h3>
</p>
<p>The area of Miyazu, where the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kokufu.html">Kokufu</a> (a local government of one of the ancient dynasties of Japan) was placed, had been a central city in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Tango (the Boys Festival).html">Tango</a> area since ancient times. Its neighborhood was the Isshiki clan's home turf with many branch castles and forts all over the area. In 1579, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yusai HOSOKAWA.html">Yusai HOSOKAWA</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Mitsuhide AKECHI.html">Mitsuhide AKECHI</a> invaded <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Tango Province.html">Tango Province</a> following Nobunaga's command to destroy the Isshiki clan who were former <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kokushu.html">kokushu</a> (major feudal lords). For their success, Fujitaka (Yusai) HOSOKAWA was rewarded with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Tango Province.html">Tango Province</a>, and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Mitsuhide AKECHI.html">Mitsuhide AKECHI</a> with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Tanba Province.html">Tanba Province</a>. Fujitaka first settled in Miyazu-jo Castle, but later built <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Tanabe-jo Castle (Tango Province).html">Tanabe-jo Castle</a> as the center of governing <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Tango Province.html">Tango Province</a>, using Miyazu-jo Castle as a branch. In 1582, after the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Honnoji Incident.html">Honnoji Incident</a> (a battle in which Mitsuhide killed Nobunaga at <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Honno-ji Temple.html">Honno-ji Temple</a>), Fujitaka devoted himself to religion and retired at Miyazu-jo Castle in order to let people know that he would not support the Akechi Family. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Tadaoki HOSOKAWA.html">Tadaoki HOSOKAWA</a>, a head of the Hosokawa family, succeeded to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Tanabe-jo Castle (Tango Province).html">Tanabe-jo Castle</a>, and while Tadaoki was absent during the Aizu seibatsu (an expedition to punish and conquer Aizu), <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Mitsunari ISHIDA.html">Mitsunari ISHIDA</a> announced he would overthrow <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Ieyasu TOKUGAWA.html">Ieyasu TOKUGAWA</a> who was behaving in defiance of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI.html">Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI</a>'s last will. The Hosokawa family supported the Tokugawa army because they had marital connections, but this caused Seigun (an army allied to Mitsunari) to attack the Hosokawa Family. Fujitaka, who was holding a fort, got out of Miyazu-jo Castle and his army barricaded themselves in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Tanabe-jo Castle (Tango Province).html">Tanabe-jo Castle</a>, but eventually they surrendered by order of the Emperor (the Battle of Tanabe Castle). </p>
<p>After the Battle of Sekigahara, the Hosokawa family was transferred to Buzen Province in Kyushu, and in place <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Takatomo KYOGOKU.html">Takatomo KYOGOKU</a> entered <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Tanabe-jo Castle (Tango Province).html">Tanabe-jo Castle</a> with 123 thousand koku to govern <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Tango Province.html">Tango Province</a>. Takatomo, in his later years, again moved the center of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Tango (the Boys Festival).html">Tango</a> from Maizuru-jo Castle to Miyazu-jo Castle, which he completely renovated. Takatomo divided <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Tango (the Boys Festival).html">Tango</a> into three: the main domain Miyazu Domain, a branch domain Tango-Tanabe Domain, and a branch domain Mineyama Domain. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Takahiro KYOGOKU.html">Takahiro KYOGOKU</a>, the head of Miyazu Domain, further massively renovated Miyazu-jo Castle into the castle we see today, by, for example, building seven two-storied towers at <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Honmaru.html">Honmaru</a> (a main part of the castle). Some historians say Tanabe Domain and Mineyama Domain were not initially independent, but only cadet families within Miyazu Domain. </p>
<p>However, Kyogoku Miyazu Domain's fief was later confiscated, and the Kyogoku family became <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Hatamoto (direct retainers of shogun).html">Hatamoto</a> (a direct retainer of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>) in the days of the second head, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Takakuni KYOGOKU.html">Takakuni KYOGOKU</a>. Since the Kyogoku family was a noble family, it was once Koke (a privileged family ranked higher than <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Hatamoto (direct retainers of shogun).html">Hatamoto</a> under the Tokugawa Shogunate) for a certain period. After that, ownership of the castle was transferred from one family to another, from the Nagai family to the Abe family, then the Okudaira family, and to the Aoyama family, but in 1758, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Sukemasa MATSUDAIRA.html">Sukemasa MATSUDAIRA</a> succeeded the castle with 770 thousand koku to keep it for seven generations until the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Meiji Restoration (Meiji-ishin).html">Meiji Restoration</a>. </p>
<p>Remains today<br/>
Since all of the castle building has disappeared leaving no sign of its former glory, it has little value for tourism. The only thing that remains to show that the castle existed on the site at all is the Taiko-mon (a gate that housed a drum) of Babasaki-gomon gate to the rear of municipal Miyazu Elementary School. </p>
<p>Also, an entrance of a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> house in the castle was moved to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Atago-jinja Shrine (Kyoto City).html">Atago-jinja Shrine</a> to build its hall of worship, which is a building in Karaha Style. </p>
