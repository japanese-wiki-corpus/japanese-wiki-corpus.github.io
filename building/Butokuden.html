<h1>Butokuden (武徳殿)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Butokuden is one of the palace buildings that used be in Daidairi (the Greater Imperial Palace including the government buildings) in the Heian period. It was used to watch horse racing in the Palace. It was located in the west of Daidairi facing the Inbu-mon Gate, between the buildings of Ukonoefu (the palace police) and Uhyoefu (Right Division of Middle Palace Guards). At the east side of Butokuden, there was an open space containing a horse riding ground and Ennomatsubara Field (a field with pine trees). </p>
<p>The headquarters of Dai Nippon Butoku Kai (a martial arts organization) for Japanese martial arts, and other martial arts training halls across the country, especially those founded in the Meiji period (including ones overseas) were also called Butokuden after the one in the Daidairi. Because they were built to promote martial arts at that time any such buildings that remain today are valued as cultural properties. </p>
