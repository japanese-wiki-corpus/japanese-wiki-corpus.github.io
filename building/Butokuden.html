It was used to watch horse racing in the Palace. It was located in the west of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Daidairi.html">Daidairi</a> facing the Inbu-mon Gate, between the buildings of Ukonoefu (the palace police) and Uhyoefu (Right Division of Middle Palace Guards).
