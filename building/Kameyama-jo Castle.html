<h1>Kameyama-jo Castle (亀山城 (丹波国))</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kameyama-jo Castle was in Kameoka, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kuwata-gun.html">Kuwata-gun</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Tanba Province.html">Tanba Province</a> (the present Aratsuka Minami in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kameoka City.html">Kameoka City</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>). It was built by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Mitsuhide AKECHI.html">Mitsuhide AKECHI</a> as his base to govern the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Tango (the Boys Festival).html">Tango</a> area, and later, at the beginning of the Edo period, it was renovated into a new type castle of the time in order to create a strategically important stronghold. Omoto (a religious sect) has its headquarters on the site today. </p>

</p>
<p><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Mitsuhide AKECHI.html">Mitsuhide AKECHI</a> started building this castle at Kameyama in 1578 in Kuchitanba which was the center of the Kameyama basin when he was attacking the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Tanba (train).html">Tanba</a> area under the order of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Nobunaga ODA.html">Nobunaga ODA</a>. After conquering <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Tanba (train).html">Tanba</a>, Mitsuhide was based here in order to govern <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Tanba (train).html">Tanba</a>, but later he brought about the Honno-ji Incident (his attack on Nobunaga at <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Honno-ji Temple.html">Honno-ji Temple</a>) in 1582, and he was killed during his retreat after losing the battle with Hideyoshi. After that, Hideyoshi's family members <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Hidekatsu HASHIBA.html">Hidekatsu HASHIBA</a> and Hidetoshi HASHIBA managed this castle in turn, as it was an important stronghold for Hideyoshi who dominated the whole country. <h3><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Edo Period.html">Edo Period</a></h3>
</p>
<p><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Ieyasu TOKUGAWA.html">Ieyasu TOKUGAWA</a>, who gained the control of the whole country after Hideyoshi's death, valued this castle as he transferred <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Nagamori OKABE.html">Nagamori OKABE</a>, who was a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Fudai Daimyo.html">Fudai Daimyo</a> (hereditary vassals of the Tokugawa or allies in the Battle of Sekigahara), to this castle as the lord (1609 - 1621) of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/family/Tanba-Kameyama Domain.html">Tanba-Kameyama Domain</a> in 1609. Also, the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">Bakufu</a> (Tokugawa Shogunate) ordered the Saigoku <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">Daimyo</a> (territorial lords in western Japan) to drastically renovate Kameyama-jo Castle into a new structure of the time under '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Tenka (the realm).html">Tenka</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Fushin.html">Fushin</a>' (the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">Bakufu</a>'s order of national construction of infrastructure). Takatora TODO arranged its walls and buildings, and it was completed in the summer of 1610, with a five-story Soto type (integrated castle tower design in the Edo period) <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Tenshu.html">Tenshu</a> (main keep) in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Honmaru.html">Honmaru</a> (the main area of the castle). This <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Tenshu.html">Tenshu</a>, which had been intended to be used for Imabari-jo Castle, was chosen to build Kameyama-jo Castle. <h3>After the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Meiji Restoration (Meiji-ishin).html">Meiji Restoration</a></h3>
</p>
<p>In 1873, the Ministry of Army decided to abolish this castle, and disposed of some of its buildings. </p>
<p>In 1877, the government decided to do away with the castle. </p>
<p>In 1889, the government sold it to local governments. </p>
<p>In 1919, Omoto (a religious institution) bought the castle as it was poorly maintained and dilapidated, refurbished it, and has occupied it to the present day. <h3>Remains</h3>
</p>
<p>Most of its <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Tenshu.html">Tenshu</a> (main keep or tower), stone walls, moat, and mound were destroyed in 1935 during a government crackdown on Omoto. Its Shingoten-mon Gate (Nagaya-mon Gate) was transferred to Kameoka City Chiyokawa Municipal Elementary School. <h3>Access</h3>
</p>
<p>It is ten minutes on foot south of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Kameoka Station.html">Kameoka Station</a> on the JR <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Sanin Main Line.html">Sanin Main Line</a>. To see the building, an application for admission is required at reception because it is the property of the religious institution Omoto. It is five minutes on foot westward from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Chiyokawa Station.html">Chiyokawa Station</a> to Chiyokawa Elementary School where the Gate has been transferred. </p>
