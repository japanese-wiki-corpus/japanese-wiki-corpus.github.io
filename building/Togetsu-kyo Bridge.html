<h1>Togetsu-kyo Bridge (渡月橋)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Togetsu-kyo is a bridge over the Katsura-gawa River in Kyoto City, Kyoto Prefecture. Its north end is in Ukyo-ku Ward and its south end Nishikyo-ku Ward. This bridge runs from north to south via Nakanoshima Island (Saga Nakanoshima-cho) to the foot of Mt. Arashi. </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>Dosho, a monk, is said to have built the first bridge between 834 and 848, and later Ryoi SUMINOKURA is said to have built a bridge at the place where the present one is. </p>
<p>The footings of the present bridge are ferroconcrete, but its wooden railings fit with the beautiful scenery of Arashiyama. This bridge represents the scenic spot Arashiyama, because many sightseeing brochures use photos showing this bridge, and it is often used for filming movies and TV dramas. </p>
<p>Cars have crashed, broken through the railings and fallen into the water, and thrown away cigarette ends have been known to cause fires on the railings, because they are made of wood. <h3>The Origin of its Name</h3>
</p>
<p>When Emperor Kameyama saw a moon move above the bridge, he said, 'It looks as if the clear moon were walking over the bridge,' so it was named 'Togetsu-kyo' (the bridge of the passing moon). <h3>Sightseeing</h3>
