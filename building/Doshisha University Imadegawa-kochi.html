<p></p>
<p>Doshisha University Imadegawa-kochi is the campus of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/school/Doshisha University.html">Doshisha University</a>. Because <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/school/Doshisha University.html">Doshisha University</a> calls its campus 'kochi,' Imadegawa-kochi is used as the title of this article. </p>
<p>Imadegawa-kochi was the site of the Satsuma domain residence in the past, and Reizeike Shiguretei Bunko (Shiguretei bunko library of the Reizei family) is located adjacently. Also, the Kyoto Imperial Palace and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Shokoku-ji Temple.html">Shokoku-ji Temple</a> are located at its north and south sides respectively. Five buildings located at Imadegawa-kochi, including Doshisha Chapel and Clarke Memorial Hall, are designated as national important cultural properties. These buildings are being used for lectures, offices, and worship even at present. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/school/Doshisha Junior High School.html">Doshisha Junior High School</a> is currently located at Imadegawa-kochi, but the decision was made to integrate it with Doshisha High School, which is located at Iwakura-kochi, in 2010 and use the site of junior high school for the university's facility. Doshisha Women's College of Liberal Arts Imadegawa-kochi, Doshisha Kindergarten and Doshisha Girl's Junior and Senior High School are also located adjacently. </p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/school/Doshisha University.html">Doshisha University</a>'s Imadegawa-kochi, Shinmachi-kochi and Muromachi-kochi are located in proximity, these three campuses are being used in an integrated <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Fashion.html">fashion</a> and they are often collectively called Imadegawa-kochi. </p>
<p><h3>History</h3>
</p>
<p>It was initially the campus of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/school/Doshisha English School.html">Doshisha English School</a>, the predecessor of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/school/Doshisha University.html">Doshisha University</a>. Since 1862, the end of the Edo period, the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> residence of the Satsuma domain was located at this place (this place was called Shokoku-ji Temple Nihonmatsu at the time). Under the state of confusion resulting from the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Meiji Restoration (Meiji-ishin).html">Meiji Restoration</a>, Western learning scholar <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Kakuma YAMAMOTO.html">Kakuma YAMAMOTO</a> (the older brother-in-law and collaborator of Jo NIIJIMA, the founder of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/school/Doshisha English School.html">Doshisha English School</a>) purchased the site of the domain's residence. When <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/school/Doshisha English School.html">Doshisha English School</a> was opened on November 29, 1875, it rented a part of Sasuzane TAKAMATSU's residence (current Niijima's former residence) for classrooms and dormitories. In 1876, about a half year after opening, the land of the current Imadegawa-kochi was donated by Yamamoto and the school moved there and constructed buildings. There were two buildings (first dormitory, second dormitory) initially, and the first floor was used as classrooms while the second floor was used as dormitories. As Doshisha was a school that believed in Christianity, opposition movements were vigorously organized by residents since the social environment in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> was not in favor of Christianity at the time. Under such circumstances, the school concluded an agreement with <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a> which prohibited it from teaching the Bible at Imadegawa-kochi. Then, Jo NIIJIMA bought a bean curd shop located near current Amherst House under his name and taught the Bible at this place instead of at the school. In fact, however, there was a case where teaching the Bible at school was discovered by an official of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a> and Niijima wrote a letter of apology. Although current buildings of Doshisha are mostly brick, the original buildings were wooden. Doshisha's first brick building was Shoeikan (the oldest brick building in existence in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>), completed in 1884 and donated by the American Board. The second dormitory was moved and reconstructed at Kyotanabe-kochi in 1970's. <h3>Faculties using Imadegawa-kochi</h3>

<p>Buildings<br/>
</p>
<p>Doshisha Chapel (Imadegawa-kochi)<br/>
</p>
<p>Letter of designation: Registration No. 1575<br/>
Classification: Modern school building<br/>
Date of designation: July 1, 1963<br/>
Age: 1886<br/>
Structure: Brick structure, 316.0 square meters, one-storey building with partial mezzanine and basement, steel sheet roofing<br/>
Designed by D.C Green and completed in 1886. American Gothic style brick-build building with steel sheet roofing. Constructed thanks to donations by the American Board. It is the oldest brick Protestant chapel in existence in Japan. Its construction was conducted by Kichibei MIKAMI, who also built the Yushukan. 
<br/>The stained glass is so beautiful, Roka TOKUTOMI described in his novel "Black eyes and brown eyes" as 'five-colored rays are falling.'<br/>
It was designated as an important national cultural property in 1963. It was partly dismantled and repaired from 1987 to 1990. It is still used as a chapel at present and worship is conducted every week. Persons who are related to Doshisha can use it for wedding ceremonies during the weekend. It is the second Doshisha Chapel (the first one was a wooden building). </p>
<p>Yushu-kan (Imadegawa-kochi)<br/>
</p>
<p>Letter of designation: Registration No. 1575<br/>
Classification: Modern school building<br/>
Date of designation: May 21, 1979 (exclusive of interior)<br/>
Age: 1887<br/>
Structure: Brick structure, 352.3 square meters, two-storey above ground and one below, sangawara-buki (clay Sangawara tile roofing)<br/>
It was completed in 1887 as Shojakukan Library. At the time of its completion, it was the biggest school library building in Japan. It was designed by D.C. Green. Its construction work was conducted by Kichibei MIKAMI. It was the university's first library. A fire broke out at Yushukan in 1928 when Emperor Showa was staying in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> for the enthronement ceremony. As the Imperial Palace, the venue of enthronement ceremony, was adjacent to Doshisha Imadegawa-kochi, the authority of university was on full alert during the period of enthronement ceremony. Nevertheless, a fire broke out because a big wooden <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Hibachi.html">hibachi</a> (heating appliance) in the guard station overheated. The president, directors and auditors of the university at the time resigned from their posts to take responsibility for the above incident. Though Yushukan's framework that survived the fire was expected to be demolished, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Goichi TAKEDA.html">Goichi TAKEDA</a>, who was engaged in the construction of an adjacent building of Doshisha Girl's School, recommended repairing and preserving it. Eventually, it was preserved by means of installing ferroconcrete walls, 15-centimeter thick on the inside of outer walls. This building was named Yushukan by Danjo EBINA when its role as a library ended. </p>
<p>Harris Science Hall (Imadegawa-kochi)<br/>

Age: 1890<br/>

Structure: Brick-build structure, 389.4 square meters, asagawara-buki roofing, a tower is attached to the southwest corner, copper sheet roofing<br/>
A copy of the architectural specifications and a volume of architectural blueprints were also designated. 
<br/>It is a German neo-gothic style building, and people relating <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/school/Doshisha University.html">Doshisha University</a> think that 'its impressive spire is something like a symbol of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/school/Doshisha University.html">Doshisha University</a>.'<br/>
It was constructed with the donations of 6,000 dollars by Mr. and Mrs. Clarke, who donated this amount in memory of their son Byron Stone Clarke who died at the age of 27. Therefore, the phrase 'THE STUDY OF THE WORD OF GOD WAS DEAR TO HIM' was engraved on the wall of the first floor. It was called Clarke Divinity Hall at the time of its opening in 1894, and it was used as a center for the education and study of theology. 
<br/>It was designated as an important national cultural property in May 1979 together with its 'architectural blueprints' and 'architectural specifications.'<br/>
Its renovation work was conducted from January 2003 to February 2008 at a cost of 1,017.6 million yen. On this occasion, the building was restored to its original state by removing portions that were alternated after its completion. At Doshisha EVE held in 2006, an event was held in which the participants wrote words on doibukiita (a base board for tile roofing) used for the restoration work. </p>
