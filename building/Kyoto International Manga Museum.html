<h1>Kyoto International Manga Museum (京都国際マンガミュージアム)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The Kyoto International Manga Museum is a manga museum established on the site of the former Tatsuike Elementary School in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Nakagyo Ward.html">Nakagyo Ward</a>, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>. </p>
<p>The museum was opened on November 25, 2006 as the first comprehensive manga museum in Japan and houses valuable domestic and overseas materials regarding cartoons and comics. It contains a collection of around 200,000 items, including important historical materials such as Meiji-period magazines and rental books of the postwar period, modern popular comics, and masterpieces around the world. </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>The museum was developed as a joint project of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/school/Kyoto Seika University.html">Kyoto Seika University</a> that has a Faculty of Manga, and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>, that provided the land and building. Now the university manages and operates the museum under the supervision of the steering committee organized by the city and the university. </p>
<p>Takeshi YORO, an anatomist who is known as the author of "The Wall of Fools" and others, serves as a part-time Executive Director. In the museum, four researchers specializing in modern history of thought, art history, and so on, have conducted research on manga culture. </p>
<p>The campus of the former Tatsuike Elementary School, which was closed, was renovated (partially enlarged) and converted to the museum building. Rui Sekkeishitsu Co., Ltd. was in charge of renovating and designing the building. Buildings that used to be the main building, assembly hall, north building, main gate and walls of the former Tatsuike Elementary School were designated as registered tangible cultural properties of Japan on July 23, 2008. </p>
<p>The museum consists of Gallery Zone which is open to the public, the Research Zone, the Archive Zone, and a community space, and also has permanent and special exhibition rooms, the Tatsuike History and Memorial Room, a museum shop, and a tea room. The main focus of the museum is the book shelves called 'Wall of Manga,' which is 140 meters long in total and contain as many as 40,000 publications. Visitors can also take the manga books outside to read on the lawn. Tickets holders can re-enter multiple times throughout the day. </p>
<p>The museum houses domestic materials as well as local editions of Japanese manga around the world and comic books from foreign countries, of which around 1,340 items are arranged for open access. They have been collected with the help of Japanese studies Centre, Monash University in Australia and The University of Leipzig in Germany. </p>
<p>Concept for the establishment of the manga museum: PPP (Public-Private Partnership)<br/>
</p>
<p>The museum has attracted attention as an example to be followed in other regions in that the city and the university jointly collects, exhibits and preserves materials so that the systematic study of manga and animation can help promote the lifelong learning, tourism activation, development of human resources and creation of new industries, the fruits of which can be shared and can contribute to the cultural activities of local communities. <h3>History</h3>
