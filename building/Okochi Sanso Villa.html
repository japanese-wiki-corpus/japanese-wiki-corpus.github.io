<h1>Okochi Sanso Villa (大河内山荘)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Located in Sagano, Ukyo Ward, Kyoto City, Okochi Sanso Villa is a historic site with a Japanese garden. Denjiro OKOCHI, a famous actor who appeared in samurai dramas, built this house and garden as his private villa. </p>
<p><h3>History</h3>
</p>
<p>In 1931, when he was 34 years old, Denjiro OKOCHI started creating this garden of his own design in the pursuit of an everlasting beauty, in contrast to movie films that were difficult to store for a long time. He spent most of the earnings from his movies to create it step by step over 30 years until the time of his death at 64. </p>
<p>It is located in a once deserted area of about 20,000 square meters between Arashiyama-koen Park (Kameyama-koen Park) and the southeastern foot of Mt. Ogura which is well known for Ogura Hyakunin Isshu (The Ogura Collection of a 100 Poems by 100 Poets). <h3>Guests</h3>
</p>
<p>His co-actors, Hideko TAKAMINE, Chiezo KATAOKA, Isuzu YAMADA, and Machiko KYO were invited to visit this place when it was his villa (refer to the photo album "Okochi Sanso"). <h3>Garden and Buildings</h3>
