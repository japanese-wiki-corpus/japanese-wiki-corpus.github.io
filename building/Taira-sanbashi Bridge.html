<h1>Taira-sanbashi Bridge (平桟橋)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Taira-sanbashi is a landing bridge at Maizuru Port. This is where repatriates from the People's Republic of China and people who had been illegally detained in the Soviet Union set foot in the home country they so eagerly hoped to return to. It is also called "Hikiage-sanbashi" (Repatriation Bridge). </p>
<p>Summary<br/>
At the end of the Pacific War the number of Japanese expatriates stranded overseas was estimated to be more than 6.6 million, and Maizuru port and another nine ports were designated repatriation ports and the Repatriation Support Bureau was set up to help them return to Japan. Although Maizuru-nishi Port (west port) was initially designated for the repatriation, later the designation was changed to Taira-sanbashi Bridge at Maizuru-higashi Port (east port) in 1947 when the repatriation from the Soviet Union started, and many repatriates arrived at Taira-sanbashi Bridge during the following thirteen years. </p>
<p>A monument stands at the landing bridge which has been restored to its original state. Close to this bridge is Maizuru Repatriation Memorial Museum which stores the records of repatriation. </p>
<p>Because 2005 is the 60th anniversary of the repatriation, several memorial events are planned to be held on and around November 7, which was the date the first repatriation ship arrived in the port. </p>
