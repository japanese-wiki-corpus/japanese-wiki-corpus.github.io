<h1>Sonobe-jo Castle (園部城)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Sonobe-jo Castle is located (initially as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Jinya.html">Jinya</a> - a government house) in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Nantan City.html">Nantan City</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>. </p>
<p>Summary<br/>
Yoshichika KOIDE, a tozama <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> (territorial <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> lord who swore loyalty to the Tokugawa clan after the Battle of Sekigahara when Tokugawa became <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>) whose territory was transferred there from Izushi, Tajima Province, built the castle in two years starting from 1619. </p>
<p>He surrounded the castle with a moats, with a natural river flow used in some parts of them. Now, the Kyoto Prefectural Sonobe High School is placed there, with the relics located on the premises. </p>
<p>Although the Koide clan was a tozama <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> lord, its two lords gained a bakkaku position (minister-level position in the bukufu government). The bukufu system ended when <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Fusanao KOIDE.html">Fusanao KOIDE</a> was the 10th lord. </p>
<p>It is said that, in the Boshin War, there was a plan to move the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Meiji.html">Emperor Meiji</a> to the Sonobe <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Jinya.html">jinya</a> located near the palace, because the safety of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> palace was threatened. Perhaps for this reason, the lord got permission from the new <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> government to convert the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Jinya.html">jinya</a> into a more solidly-built castle, and built a yagura-mon gate, a tatsumi-yagura turret, and a three-layer turret on Komugi-yama Mountain in two years starting from 1868. However, in 1872, the buildings other than those that still remain were destroyed and removed. </p>
