<h1>The Museum of Kyoto (京都文化博物館)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Located in Nakagyo Ward in Kyoto City, the Museum of Kyoto was established in commemoration of the 1200th anniversary of Heian Sento (the relocation of the capital to found the Heian capital) to showcase the culture and history of Kyoto. The Kyoto Prefectural Government built the facility, and Kyoto Culture Foundation runs the museum. It opened on October 1, 1988. Its official name "Kyoto Prefecture Museum of Culture" is sometimes used. </p>
<p>It was formerly a private museum called Heian Museum established in 1968 as a facility of the Paleological Association of Japan, Inc. The building, the former Bank of Japan Kyoto Branch (an Important Cultural Property), was donated to Kyoto Prefecture to establish the Museum of Kyoto. The building occupied by the former Bank of Japan Kyoto Branch is now the annex of the Museum of Kyoto. The main hall of the Museum of Kyoto is a building of ferroconcrete with seven stories above ground and a one-story basement newly built at the north side of this annex. </p>
<p>With the establishment of the Museum of Kyoto, the management of the materials stored in Kyoto Prefectural Library and Archives was entrusted to Kyoto Culture Foundation (an organization that runs the Museum of Kyoto). 
<br/>Therefore these materials are sometimes labeled 'Stored by Kyoto Prefectural Library and Archives, and managed by the Museum of Kyoto.'<br/>
