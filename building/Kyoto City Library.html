<h1>Kyoto City Library (京都市図書館)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kyoto City Library is a group of municipal libraries of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>. </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>There are twenty municipal libraries in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, including Chuo Library (the central library) and district libraries. A mobile library "Kojika-go" (literally, a fawn) stationed at Chuo Library travels round thirty-nine districts that once in a month. </p>
<p>Material of the libraries can be read and viewed by anyone free of charge. However, one needs a library card to borrow material. By presenting the library card, each individual can borrow up to ten items (two items of audiovisual materials) for up to two weeks. To return material, one can simply bring the material to any one of the libraries, except for audiovisual material which should be returned to the library from where one rented them. </p>
