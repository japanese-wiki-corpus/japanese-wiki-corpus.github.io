<h1>Kyoto Cinema (京都シネマ)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kyoto Cinema (a mini-theater) is located in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Shijo Karasuma.html">Shijo Karasuma</a>, Shimogyo-ku Ward, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>. The cinema was opened on December 4, 2004 and is operated by Kisaragisha. With three screens, it puts mostly films for independent cinemas on the screens. </p>
<p>In two years before its opening, Kyoto Asahi Cinema with two screens was closed, reducing the opportunities to play films for independent cinemas in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>. However, staff from Kyoto Asahi Cinema managed to open such a cinema in a newly built commercial facility. </p>
<p>In 2006, it concluded an academic exchange contract with Ritsumeikan University. </p>
