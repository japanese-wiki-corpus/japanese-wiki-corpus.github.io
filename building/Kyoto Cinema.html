<h1>Kyoto Cinema (京都シネマ)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kyoto Cinema (a mini-theater) is located in Shijo Karasuma, Shimogyo-ku Ward, Kyoto City, Kyoto Prefecture. The cinema was opened on December 4, 2004 and is operated by Kisaragisha. With three screens, it puts mostly films for independent cinemas on the screens. </p>
<p>In two years before its opening, Kyoto Asahi Cinema with two screens was closed, reducing the opportunities to play films for independent cinemas in Kyoto City. However, staff from Kyoto Asahi Cinema managed to open such a cinema in a newly built commercial facility. </p>
<p>In 2006, it concluded an academic exchange contract with Ritsumeikan University. </p>
