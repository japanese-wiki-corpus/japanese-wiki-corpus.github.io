<p></p>
<p>Fukuchiyama-jo Castle is a hirayamajiro (flatland-mountain castle) located in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Fukuchiyama City.html">Fukuchiyama City</a> in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>. </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>This was a residential castle built to govern the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/family/Fukuchiyama Domain.html">Fukuchiyama Domain</a> in the Edo period. </p>
<p>It was originally a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Kakiage.html">kakiage</a> type castle (a simple and small castle on a stamped mound of soil and rocks) called <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Yokoyama-jo Castle (in Omi Province).html">Yokoyama-jo Castle</a> built by Yorikatsu SHIOMI who is said to have been a descendant of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Nagakiyo OGASAWARA.html">Nagakiyo OGASAWARA</a> of the late Muromachi period. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Mitsuhide AKECHI.html">Mitsuhide AKECHI</a>, after conquring <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Tanba Province.html">Tanba Province</a>, changed its name to Fukuchiyama-jo Castle (福智山城), and embarked on major renovations to turn it into a new structure of the time (its castellan was Gonbee FUJIKI and later, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Hidemitsu AKECHI.html">Hidemitsu AKECHI</a>). Later in the Edo period, its castellan of the Kutsuki clan changed the Chinese character of its name from '福智山' (Fukuchiyama) to '福知山' (Fukuchiyama). </p>
<p>Its <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Tenshu.html">Tenshu</a> (donjon) was restored in 1985 and is now a facility of Fukuchiyama City Folk Museum in Fukuchiyamajo-koen Park which used be the castle compound. At the side of the entrance of the park stands Fukuchiyama City Sato Taisei Memorial Art Museum whose structure is of Sumiyagura (turret) Style Castle Architecture. </p>
<p>It is also called "Garyu-jo Castle" (lying dragon castle), because it is on a hill protruding from Fukuchiyama basin overlooking the surrounding urban area, and the hill looks like a lying dragon. Its <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Tenshu.html">Tenshu</a> can be seen from both National Route 9 and the JR <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Fukuchiyama Line.html">Fukuchiyama Line</a>, and is illuminated at night as a symbol of the city. Many cherry trees around the castle are magnificent when in full bloom in spring. </p>
<p>Features<br/>
Its <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Kuruwa (Castle compound).html">Kuruwa</a> (the walls of the castle and the regions surrounded by them) lies from the tip of the hill, which protrudes from Fukuchiyama basin, to the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Honmaru.html">Honmaru</a> (the core of the castle) linking the Ninomaru (second bailey), Hokimaru (third bailey), and Naikimaru (fourth bailey) forming a Renkaku style (連郭式) serial <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Kuruwa (Castle compound).html">Kuruwa</a>. The <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Honmaru.html">Honmaru</a> and Ninomaru had a palace, and as the Ninomaru was largest at the center of the castle it was probably the central facility. In the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Horinouchi.html">Horinouchi</a> (inside the moat) where the land on both sides is flat, there was a meeting terrace and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> houses to the north where Ote-mon Gate (main gate) was, and to the south, Kura (storehouses), Umaya (horse stables), Takabeya (falcon house), and a garden. Also there were <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Nagaya (long house).html">Nagaya</a> (long houses) for Hirazamurai (lower-ranked <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a>) on a terrace beyond the Naikimaru. Carved out pathways after it was abandoned and railroad construction have divided the hill on which the castle structures used to be, and only the walls of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Honmaru.html">Honmaru</a> remain today. The pathway to climb the present donjon was built later to access Asahi-jinja Shrine which was transferred to the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Honmaru.html">Honmaru</a>, and the original main street was connected with the Ninomaru which is now a residential area. </p>
<p>Ano shu (groups of stone wall technicians) built its stone wall by Nozura-zumi (an old method of building robust stone walls), and this is a Cultural Property designated by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Fukuchiyama City.html">Fukuchiyama City</a>. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Nobunaga ODA.html">Nobunaga ODA</a> and his retainers commonly used gravestones and stone Buddhist images to build walls, but the large number of those stones found in the walls of this castle is outstanding, only matched by Koriyama-jo Castle. The reason for this is not known, but there are some suggested explanations such as that it was due to a shortage of time or materials, or that it was to show off the builders' power to other war lords. </p>
<p>The well called 'Toyonoiwai' in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Honmaru.html">Honmaru</a> is Japan's deepest well inside a castle (50 meters deep, and reaching below sea level). </p>
<p>The restored <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Tenshu.html">Tenshu</a> (donjon or keep) is of Boro type (with the top tower keep placed on the main structure) of the era of Nobunaga with a Dai-tenshu (large keep of three roofs and four stories), Tsuzuki-yagura (linking turrets), and connected Sho-tenshu (small keep). Its exterior looks like its original appearance but the structure is of ferroconcrete. <h3>Remains</h3>
</p>
<p>The stone walls of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Honmaru.html">Honmaru</a> and the well remain today, but the walls of the Ninomaru and other outer structures are lost due to land development. </p>
<p>As extant architecture, there remains the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bansho.html">Bansho</a> (guard station) at the side of Akagane-mon Gate (Tamonyagura, or hall turrets) which has been transferred to the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Honmaru.html">Honmaru</a> from the Ninomaru. Each of the castle gates was transferred in order to build each San-mon Gate (main gate of a Buddhist Temple) of Kanryu-ji Temple, Shogen-ji Temple, Hosho-ji Temple, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Myokaku-ji Temple (Kyoto City).html">Myokaku-ji Temple</a>, and Zuirin-ji Temple, and they remain today. </p>
<p>Fukuchiyama-jo Castle and Fukuchiyama Ondo (Fukuchiyama folk tune)<br/>
Fukuchiyama Ondo, established during the Edo period, is a Bon Festival Dance with a unique phrase 'Dokkoi-see, Dokkoi-see.'<br/>
Legend has it that this comes from the construction work of the castle during which workers rhythmically called out like this when carrying stones. <h3>Access</h3>
</p>
<p>15 minutes on foot from <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Fukuchiyama Station.html">Fukuchiyama Station</a> on the JR <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Fukuchiyama Line.html">Fukuchiyama Line</a>, JR <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/railway/Sanin Main Line.html">Sanin Main Line</a>, and Kitakinki Tango Railway<br/>
