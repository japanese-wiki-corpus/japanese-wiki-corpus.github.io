<h1>Japanese-style Room (和室)</h1>
<p>A Japanese-style room is a room on whose floor tatami mats are laid in a traditional Japanese house. The method of laying tatami mats depends on the tradition, and, as is well known, the size of a room was measured by counting the number of tatami mats laid. </p>

<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>Space is surrounded with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Shoji (Paper Sliding Screen).html">shoji</a> (paper sliding doors) or <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Fusuma.html">Fusuma</a> (Japanese sliding doors), and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Shoji (Paper Sliding Screen).html">shoji</a> especially generate fuzzy and dim effects, giving an impression of ambiguity of whether or not the space is completely partitioned. Thus, a subtle and profound light is brought about. </p>
<p>A Japanese style room offers a multi-purpose space that can be used for purposes from dining, to a family get-together, a study or a bedroom, achieved by taking out and putting in things such as a folding table, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Zabuton.html">zabuton</a> (traditional Japanese cushions used to sit on the floor), and Japanese-style bedding. Furthermore, shoes or slippers are not required in a Japanese-style room. Tatami mats, being made of plants called rushes, offer a sense of togetherness with nature and generate feelings of coolness in summer and warmth in winter, which are features of a Japanese-style room. </p>
<p>Japanese-style room in Taiwan<br/>
In Taiwan, there are quite a few houses with Japanese-style rooms which have been passed down from the period of Japanese rule. This is called héìshì/héshìh (pinyin: indicating a pronunciation and tones) in Chinese. However, tatami mats are not suitable for the climate; they are often replaced with wood flooring called héìshì de ban (wood floor in Japanese-style room) in Chinese. </p>
<p>In Taiwan, a Japanese-style room is mainly used for a bedroom. It is also used for a Buddhist hall and for a Shosai (a study or a library). </p>
