<h1>Rakuraku-so Hotel (楽々荘)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Rakuraku-so is a hotel using the former Gentaro TANAKA's residence in Kameoka City, Kyoto Prefecture. The western style building built in 1899 and the Japanese garden designed by seventh Jihe OGAWA are famous. </p>
<p>Summary<br/>
In around 1897 to 1906, Gentaro TANAKA, who was the founder of the Kyoto railway company (present Sanin Main Line) and a member of Kizokuin (the upper house of the Imperial Diet under the Constitution of the Empire of Japan), reformed the house where he was born into the present form. </p>
<p>A brick-made western style building was constructed in 1899 as his main residence, with a Japanese shoin-style building as the guesthouse. The approx. 2,149 square meters walk-through garden with a dried pond and water-spring in front of the western style building and the Japanese style building was designed by seventh Jihe OGAWA (Ueji), and stone lanterns and iron wells in the Azuchi-Momoyama period was brought here from Kameyama-jo Castle. </p>
<p>Since 1948, it has become the 'Hozugawa Kanko Hotel Rakurakuso' (Rakuraku-so Hotel for Hozugawa sightseeing), and now the second floor of the western building is used for guest rooms, the first floor for a café restaurant and the garden for another café and for weddings. The place is lit up in the night. </p>
