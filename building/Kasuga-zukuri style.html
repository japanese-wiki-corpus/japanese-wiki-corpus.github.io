<h1>Kasuga-zukuri style (春日造)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kasuga-zukuri style is one of the architectural styles of shrines in Japan. </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>Kasuga-zukuri style, which is typified by Kasuga-taisha Shrine, employs kirizuma-zukuri style (an architectural style with a gabled roof) with a Tsuma-iri (entrance on the gable side) as is the case with taisha-zukuri style as exemplified by Izumo-taisha Shrine; however, its roof is curved toward each side and is also provided at the front, forming a kohai (a roof built over the steps leading up to a temple building (i.e., eaves)). Many shrines of this style are influenced by temple architecture in terms of colors, etc. <h3>Structures</h3>
</p>
<p>The structure of kasuga-zukuri style employs kirizuma-zukuri style with a Tsuma-iri, and, similar to taisha-zukuri style, elegant curves are provided on the roof. <h3>Roofs</h3>
</p>
<p>The roofs are not necessarily thatched; there are wide varieties, from kokerabuki (a roof covering made with a layer of thin wooden shingles made of cypress) to hiwadabuki (cypress bark roof). </p>
<p>The hafu (a barge board) on the front is set off in a triangular shape and decorated with a gegyo (decorative wooden board used to cover the ridge and purlin ends on a roof gable). Chigi (ornamental crossbeams on the gable of a Shinto shrine) and Katsuogi (ornamental logs arranged orthogonal to the ridge of a Shinto shrine) are provided for decorative purposes. </p>
<p>The slope of the kohai extending frontward is not steep and forms an elegant curve. </p>
<p>Pillars<br/>
</p>
<p>The pillars are symmetrical, with an even number of marubashira (circular pillars or posts) provided to each side. </p>
<p>If ketayuki (distance spanned by the longitudinal purlins or plates of the main frame) is approximately 3.6 meters (two pillars), the structure is referred to as ikkensha Kasuga-zukuri style (shrines built to the width of just a single bay at the gable ends), and if ketayuki is approximately 5.5 meters (four pillars), the structure is referred to as sangensha Kasuga-zukuri style (shrines built to the width of three bays at the gable ends). </p>
<p>Walls<br/>
</p>
<p>A double-door opening is provided at one location, at the center on the front. </p>
<p>Waki-shoji (side-screens) are often provided on the sides. </p>
<p>Floors<br/>
</p>
<p>The structure has a high floor, giving consideration to air permeability as in the case of taisha-zukuri style. </p>
