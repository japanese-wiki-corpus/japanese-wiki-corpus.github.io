<h1>Skyland Ikoma (スカイランドいこま)</h1>
<p>Skyland Ikoma is a theme park located at the top of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Mt. Ikoma.html">Mt. Ikoma</a> in Ikoma City, Nara Prefecture. It is operated by Kintetsu Leisure Service, a subsidiary of Kinki Nippon Railway Company (while it was under the management of Kintetsu Kogyo Kabushiki Gaisha until 2004 when that company was dissolved). </p>
<p>Summary<br/>
There used to be admission fees for Skyland Ikoma but it is free at present. There are charges for rides (such as the roller coaster) as in the past. The airplane tower in this park is the oldest of the existing rides in Japan. The airplane tower was used as an air defense surveillance center during the war. </p>
<p>At 642 meter elevation, the beautiful night view overlooking Osaka Bay stretches out from the top of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Mt. Ikoma.html">Mt. Ikoma</a> but there are not many places with view in Skyland Ikoma. </p>
<p>To visit Skyland Ikoma by train, get off at Kintetsu Ikoma Station and transfer to a cable car at the connecting Toriimae Station. Cable cars are decorated with paintings of animals and pastries. </p>
<p>Since 2006, strong efforts have been put into flora in the park and there have been more flowers every year. </p>
<p>During the season when the park is open, various shows are organized on the weekends and statutory holidays. </p>
<p>There is the 'Petting Park' (admission extra) in addition to the rides. Dogs and cats are unrestrained and can be touched in the Petting Park. </p>
<p>Subsequent to 2000, the number of visitors decreased sharply with the opening of Universal Studios Japan, forcing the park to close during the winter months since 2003, but a New Year's Eve event has been organized between December 31 and January 1 in some years. </p>
<p>Skyland Ikoma crosses over the border between Osaka and Nara prefectures and, with Kintetsu Ayameike Amusement Park and Nara Dreamland having closed their doors, it is the only theme park remaining in Nara Prefecture at present. </p>
<p>In the park, there are steel towers of Mt. Ikoma TV FM Transmission Station (the parent station) for television stations in Osaka. </p>
<p>In 2007, while the park was closed for the winter, Ultra Twister and Sky Loop were dismantled. </p>
