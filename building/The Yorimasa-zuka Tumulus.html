<h1>The Yorimasa-zuka Tumulus (頼政塚)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Built on a small hill in present day Nishi-Tsutsujigaoka-cho, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kameoka City.html">Kameoka City</a>, the Yorimasa-zuka Tumulus is the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kubizuka (tomb of heads).html">Kubizuka</a> (tomb of the head) of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Yorimasa.html">MINAMOTO no Yorimasa</a> of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Tada-Genji (Minamoto clan).html">Tada-Genji</a> (Minamoto clan), who died an untimely death towards the end of the Heian period. It is said that the body of Yorimasa who died in a battle at Uji was not buried here, because the Tanba Yada-go Village was of all his territories the nearest to Uji. However, it is unclear whether this is correct or not. It is said that in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Edo Period.html">Edo Period</a>, a local priest doubted its existence, excavated the tumulus, and found a stone coffin there. Now, Tsutsujigaoka Elementary School, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kameoka City.html">Kameoka City</a> is located adjacent to the tumulus. </p>
<p>There is a Yorimasa-zuka crossing on National Route 9 in Joboji, Shino-cho, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kameoka City.html">Kameoka City</a>, and a Yorimasa-zuka Bus Stop where <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Keihan.html">Keihan</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Kyoto Kotsu (Maizuru City).html">Kyoto Kotsu</a> buses stop. </p>
