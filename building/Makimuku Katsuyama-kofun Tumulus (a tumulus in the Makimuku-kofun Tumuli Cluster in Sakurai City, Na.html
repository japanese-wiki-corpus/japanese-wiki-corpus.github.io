<h3>Method of Measuring the Age from Tree Rings</h3>
</p>
<p>May 30, 2001. The Nara National Research Institute for Cultural Properties Archaeological Center measured the age of Japanese cypress boards excavated from the mud at the constricted spot of the shugo at the fourth research, and as a result, it was made clear that the original tree is presumed to have been cut down about in 210 at the latest. </p>
<p>Before measuring the age from tree rings, the age criterion was determined by the unearthed Furu 0-type earthen vessels based on the chronology of earthen vessels. The date estimated by the chronology is before or after 300. </p>
