<h3>Method of Measuring the Age from Tree Rings</h3>
</p>
<p>May 30, 2001. The Nara National Research Institute for Cultural Properties Archaeological Center measured the age of Japanese cypress boards excavated from the mud at the constricted spot of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a> at the fourth research, and as a result, it was made clear that the original tree is presumed to have been cut down about in 210 at the latest. </p>
<p>Before measuring the age from tree rings, the age criterion was determined by the unearthed Furu 0-type earthen vessels based on the chronology of earthen vessels. The date estimated by the chronology is before or after 300. </p>
