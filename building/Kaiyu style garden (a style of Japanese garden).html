<h1>Kaiyu style garden (a style of Japanese garden) (回遊式庭園)</h1>
<p>The Kaiyu style garden is a Japanese garden where circulating walking paths are provided for enjoying views of the garden. Gardens with circulating walking paths exist in countries other than Japan, but the term Kaiyu is mostly used for Japanese style gardens. </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>Kaiyu style gardens progressed from gardens for daimyo (Japanese feudal lords) in the Edo period, and it is said that all elements of Japanese gardens before that era are integrated there. </p>
<p>The most typical such gardens are called Chisen Kaiyu style gardens, in which a big pond is placed at the center, walking paths are provided around the pond, and the landscape, for example, of a scenic spot was reproduced with tsukiyama (artificial miniature hills), small islands in the pond, bridges and beautiful stones. Houses for tea ceremony and azuma-ya (small arbors) are placed in various locations in the garden, for resting while walking or for enjoying views of the garden. <h3>Typical kaiyu style gardens</h3>
