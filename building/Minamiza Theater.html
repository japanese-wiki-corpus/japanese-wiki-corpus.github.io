<h1>Minamiza Theater (南座)</h1>
<p></p>

<p>This <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kabuki.html">Kabuki</a> (traditional drama performed by male actors) theater has been showing <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kabuki.html">Kabuki</a> since the Edo period, and every year from the end of November to the end of December a seasonal tradition called the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kaomise.html">Kaomise</a> (a face-showing ceremony) is staged. The many plain wooden boards called 'Maneki' having each actor's name written in Kanteiryu (a special calligraphy style for <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kabuki.html">Kabuki</a>) arranged above the entrance of the theater during this period are well-known. In addition, plays other than <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kabuki.html">Kabuki</a> such as Shingeki (literally 'New Play') created by Shochiku, are also staged (as of 2007). </p>
<p>It is in the style of the Azuchi-Momoyama period and is a Registered Tangible Cultural Property, completed in 1929 and renovated in 1991 keeping its former exterior yet being equipped with the latest facilities. </p>
