<h1>Minamiza Theater (南座)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Minamiza is a theater located in Higashiyama Ward, Kyoto City. Its official name is Kyoto Shijo Minamiza Theater. It is run by Shochiku Co. Ltd. </p>
<p>This Kabuki (traditional drama performed by male actors) theater has been showing Kabuki since the Edo period, and every year from the end of November to the end of December a seasonal tradition called the Kaomise (a face-showing ceremony) is staged. The many plain wooden boards called 'Maneki' having each actor's name written in Kanteiryu (a special calligraphy style for Kabuki) arranged above the entrance of the theater during this period are well-known. In addition, plays other than Kabuki such as Shingeki (literally 'New Play') created by Shochiku, are also staged (as of 2007). </p>
<p>It is in the style of the Azuchi-Momoyama period and is a Registered Tangible Cultural Property, completed in 1929 and renovated in 1991 keeping its former exterior yet being equipped with the latest facilities. </p>
