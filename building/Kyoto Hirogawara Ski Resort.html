<h1>Kyoto Hirogawara Ski Resort (京都広河原スキー場)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Located in Hirogawara Obana-cho, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Sakyo Ward.html">Sakyo Ward</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>, Kyoto Hirogawara Ski Resort is the only ski resort in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>. </p>
<p>Hirogawara can be reached in about 90 minutes by car from the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> urban area, and despite within <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a> it has heavy snowfall because it is in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Tanba (train).html">Tanba</a> uplands. </p>
<p>It was closed during the ski seasons of 2000 to 2002, but it obtained enough investment to resume business in December 2002. </p>
<p>It is considered a good spot because you can enjoy quickly the pleasure of ski on its easy slopes, and it is not famous and so not crowded even on holidays. </p>
<p>Many visitors enjoy skiing there after work on weekdays, and on Saturdays when it is opens until 23:00 at night. </p>
<p>It closed on March 23, 2008 for the season due to the lack of snowfall that winter. </p>
<p><h3>Information about its slopes</h3>
</p>
<p>Hirogawara Ski Resort is a small-scale site consisting of two courses and one lift. </p>
<p>The ski slopes consist of the summit course (its average slope angle is 15 degrees, and is 450 meters in length), and the middle course (13 degrees, 250 meters), and it is possible to ski from the summit course through the middle course without a break. </p>
<p>The summit course runs winding down the mountain slope between many trees. Because of this, this course is narrow and has some basin like sections. </p>
<p>Compared with the summit course, the middle course is easy to ski because it is wide and straight with a small grade. </p>
<p>Snowboarding is allowed on the both courses equipped with skates (スケート) and kickers. <h3>Facilities</h3>
