<h1>Wachigaiya (the name of a tea house) (輪違屋)</h1>
<p>Wachigaiya is an okiya (geisha dwelling) and machiai-jaya (tea house to lend seats and tables, or rooms) that even now operates in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Shimabara.html">Shimabara</a>, a hanamachi (geisha district) in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. </p>
<p>It has its origin in an okiya that started in 1688. </p>
<p>The okiya was named Yokaro at its start. </p>
<p>The Ochaya (teahouse) business was added in 1872. </p>
<p>The present building was reconstructed in 1857. 
<br/>(The present building is almost unchanged since 1871.)<br/>
</p>
<p>In the past, it employed <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Geigi.html">geigi</a> (geisha girls) as well, but today, employs only tayu (geisha of the highest rank), providing training opportunities for them, and is used for banquets. </p>
<p>On the street door, there is a 'no visitors allowed' sign (this store practices so-called 'Ichigensan Okotowari' – only accepting new customers through introductions). </p>
<p>In 1984, the building was designated as a registered cultural property by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>. </p>
<p>It features an 'Umbrella room,' on whose sliding doors umbrellas used in tayu parades are pasted, and a 'Room of autumn leaves,' on whose walls autumn leaves, drawn tracing real ones, are colored. </p>
<p>Both of the rooms were used by the owner. </p>
<p>Wachigaiya is well known through "Wachigaiya <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Itosato.html">Itosato</a>," a novel by Jiro ASADA and broadcasted as a TV drama, but there is no record on the Wachigaiya side that <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Itosato.html">Itosato</a> lived at Wachigaiya. </p>
<p>'Sakuragi tayu,' famous as 'A beauty in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Meiji Restoration (Meiji-ishin).html">Meiji Restoration</a>' belonged to Wachigaiya. 
<br/>(The episode in novels or dramas in which <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Itosato.html">Itosato</a> becomes 'Sakuragi tayu' is fictional.)<br/>
