<h1>Wachigaiya (the name of a tea house) (輪違屋)</h1>
<p>Wachigaiya is an okiya (geisha dwelling) and machiai-jaya (tea house to lend seats and tables, or rooms) that even now operates in Shimabara, a hanamachi (geisha district) in Kyoto. </p>
<p>It has its origin in an okiya that started in 1688. </p>
<p>The okiya was named Yokaro at its start. </p>
<p>The Ochaya (teahouse) business was added in 1872. </p>
<p>The present building was reconstructed in 1857. 
<br/>(The present building is almost unchanged since 1871.)<br/>
</p>
<p>In the past, it employed geigi (geisha girls) as well, but today, employs only tayu (geisha of the highest rank), providing training opportunities for them, and is used for banquets. </p>
<p>On the street door, there is a 'no visitors allowed' sign (this store practices so-called 'Ichigensan Okotowari' – only accepting new customers through introductions). </p>
<p>In 1984, the building was designated as a registered cultural property by Kyoto City. </p>
<p>It features an 'Umbrella room,' on whose sliding doors umbrellas used in tayu parades are pasted, and a 'Room of autumn leaves,' on whose walls autumn leaves, drawn tracing real ones, are colored. </p>
<p>Both of the rooms were used by the owner. </p>
<p>Wachigaiya is well known through "Wachigaiya Itosato," a novel by Jiro ASADA and broadcasted as a TV drama, but there is no record on the Wachigaiya side that Itosato lived at Wachigaiya. </p>
<p>'Sakuragi tayu,' famous as 'A beauty in the Meiji Restoration' belonged to Wachigaiya. 
<br/>(The episode in novels or dramas in which Itosato becomes 'Sakuragi tayu' is fictional.)<br/>
