<h1>Buke Yashiki (武家屋敷)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>A "Buke Yashiki" is typically a mansion which a <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> (provincial lord) kept in Edo as a second house and as a branch office in the Edo period. It is also called Daimyo Yashiki (<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> residence). It was also called ''Hantei". Its antonym is Kuge Yashiki (residence of a court noble). </p>
<p>Today's definition also covers "Samurai Yashiki" which was a residence of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> after the Sengoku period (period of warring states). </p>
<p><h3>Daimyo Yashiki</h3>
</p>
<p>"Daimyo Yashiki" refers to the residence of a master served by a <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a>, a residence <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> kept inside or outside a castle, or a residence <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> kept regardless of his place of work or habitation. It sometimes referred to a building where hostages were kept, or one to accommodate workers and offices for public construction work. The definition also includes the Daimyo <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Jinya.html">Jinya</a> (fortified house) that was built at Nagoya-jo Castle (in Saga Prefecture) during the Bunroku-Keicho War (wars initiated by the invasion of the Korean Peninsula by <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI.html">Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI</a>'s army in 1592 through 1598). <h3>Edo period</h3>
</p>
<p>In the Edo period, the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Bakufu.html">Bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>) provided <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Daimyo.html">Daimyo</a> with land in the neighborhood of Edo-jo Castle or in suburban areas where <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> built their houses, and they also kept residences in Osaka or in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> for their own convenience. Daimyo Yashiki in Edo were places where <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> stayed during their term of Sankinkotai (duty of alternate-year attendance in Edo), and they also had an embassy-like function for <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> (han, or his domain) for political or economical negotiations with the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Bakufu.html">Bakufu</a>. </p>
<p>Daimyo Yashiki in Edo<br/>
</p>
<p>The <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Bakufu.html">Bakufu</a> provided <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> with Kami (upper) Yashiki, Naka (middle) Yashiki, and Shimo (lower) Yashiki to own and use. Kami, Naka, and Shimo were distinguished by their distance from Edo-jo Castle. In 1738, the standard area of Kami Yashiki was set according to the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a>'s Rokudaka (stipend assessed on the basis of the crop yield of a <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a>'s domain), but in practice the total area did not conform to it. </p>
<p>The <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> and his family lived in his Kami Yashiki and he used Shimo Yashiki as his private space. Some <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> held Naka Yashiki in the middle. 
<br/>(Refer to 'Edo Hantei.')<br/>
</p>
<p>Kura Yashiki, a kind of Shimo Yashiki, had several warehouses and residences in the compound which was built on the coast or at the mouth of a river, and these were facilities for the distribution of the products of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a>'s home domain to transport them to Edo, and to put them into the market for disposal. They were mainly used for economic activities. 
<br/>(Refer to "Kura Yashiki" for details.)<br/>
<h3>Samurai Yashiki</h3>
</p>
<p>"Samurai Yashiki" were residences for low ranked <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a>. <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Samurai.html">Samurai</a> used to live in their local domains in the medieval period, but after the Sengoku period soldiers did not need to farm and were forced to live in castle towns leaving their farmlands behind. It was similar to housing for government workers today. "Samurai-machi" was an area where many Samurai Yashiki were built. Samurai-machi were purposefully built in order to defend the castle structure. In castle towns, some castles had Samurai-machi in their Sannomaru (outer area of a castle) or inside the outer castle walls. In <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Jinya.html">jinya</a> (regional government office) areas, they had small scale <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> yashiki inside <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Jinya.html">jinya</a> compounds. Although many ordinary <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> such as <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Hatamoto (direct retainers of shogun).html">Hatamoto</a> (direct retainers of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>) or <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Gokenin.html">Gokenin</a> (lower-ranked vassals) had residences which differed little from folk houses, upper or middle class Samurai Yashiki had mud walls, Nagayamon (a gate and long house for vassals), and Shikidai (an entrance hall with a wooden floor), and even lower class ones had at least <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Zashiki.html">zashiki</a> (a tatami-mat reception room) of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/building/Shoin-zukuri.html">Shoin-zukuri</a> style (a typical traditional Japanese style house), attempting to display their high status. </p>
<p>In the Edo period, because <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Shinto/Shake.html">Shake</a> (<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> priest families) had the rank and status similar to that of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> class, their residences were also similar. <h3>Townscapes of Buke Yashiki (Samurai Yashiki) and Shake-machi (<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Shinto/Shake.html">Shake</a> towns)</h3>
</p>
<p>The <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Meiji Restoration (Meiji-ishin).html">Meiji Restoration</a> made Samurai Yashiki redundant and many of them were dismantled, and the Second World War and the urban development which followed it caused most of them to be destroyed. However, some Samurai Yashiki or Samurai-machi areas survive today in the form they once held, and some of them are designated as Important Preservation Districts for Groups of Historic Buildings. </p>
