<p>This set includes a huge amount of documents that had been stored in the treasure house of To-ji, of which 24,067 items from the Nara period (the eighth century) through the Edo period were designated as <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/National Treasures (of Japan).html">National Treasures</a>. This includes many varieties of historical documents such as those related to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Shoen.html">Shoen</a> (manor), that are very important not only for the history of economics and Buddhism, but also for the whole study of Japanese history. They are valued as historical materials because they are preserved as they were originally made without being converted into scrolls or hanging scrolls. Tsunanori MAEDA, a lord of Kaga clan, recognizing the value of these documents, donated a hundred of document boxes for preservation to the temple in 1685. The name 'Hyakugo Monjo'(literally, a hundred of documents) comes from this 'go' which is a unit for counting containers consisting of a box and a lid. </p>
