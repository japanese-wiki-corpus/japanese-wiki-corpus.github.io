<h1>Makishima-jo Castle (槇島城)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Maishima-jo Castle was once located in Makishima-cho, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Uji City.html">Uji City</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>. It is written as 槙島城 or 填島城. </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>In the past, there was a big pond/swamp called <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Ogura-ike Pond.html">Ogura-ike Pond</a> at a place near Uji in Yamashina Province, and Makishima was an island in the pond. A <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Gozoku (local ruling family).html">gozoku</a> (powerful group) called the Makishima clan was deeply rooted there, building a castle. It was Makishima-jo Castle. In 1573, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshiaki ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshiaki ASHIKAGA</a> on the government side took up arms against <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Nobunaga ODA.html">Nobunaga ODA</a>, and took refuge in Makishima-jo Castle counting on Akimitsu MAKISHIMA who was a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Bugyoshu (group of magistrates).html">bugyoshu</a> (group of magistrates). Nobunaga entered <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> immediately, and sieged the castle, forcing Yoshiaki to surrender (the battle of Makishima-jo Castle). After that, Yoshiaki was forced to retire to Wakae-jo Castle in Kawachi Province, and the Ashikaga bukufu both in name and reality perished. After Yoshiaki left, Naomasa HARADA and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshihiro IDO.html">Yoshihiro IDO</a> became the masters of the castle, but after <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Fushimi-jo Castle.html">Fushimi-jo Castle</a> was constructed, its strategic value diminished, causing the castle to be abolished. <h3>Relics</h3>
