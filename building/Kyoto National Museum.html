<h1>Kyoto National Museum (京都国立博物館)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The Kyoto National Museum is run by the National Institutes for Cultural Heritage. It opened in May 1897. </p>
<p>It is an institution for the collection, preservation and exhibition of cultural properties, mainly those of the Kyoto culture from the Heian through Edo periods. Additionally, special exhibitions are held at the museum two or three times each year. </p>
<p>Among its exhibition halls, the main hall (Special Exhibition Hall) was designed by Tokuma KATAYAMA, a leading architect for the Imperial Household, and the new hall (the Collections Hall) was designed by Keichi MORITA, a professor emeritus at Kyoto University. </p>
<p>Its collection includes 27 items designated as national treasures and 181 items designated as important cultural properties (as of March 2006). For its buildings, the main hall, the front gate (main gate), the ticket office and sodebei (outside wall) were designated as important cultural properties in 1969 as "the Former Imperial Museum of Kyoto," and the Technical Materials Center (Kyu Onshi Kyoto Hakubutsukan Chinretsuhin Shunoyo Soko) was designated as a national cultural facility in 2008. </p>
<p>The following projects are under way: dismantlement of the Collections Hall (December 2008); the plan for construction of Centennial Hall for regular exhibitions (tentative name; designed by Yoshio TANIGUCHI, with construction work from January 31, 2009 and completion scheduled for March 31, 2013); the plan to build the South Gate Museum Shop (tentative name; designed by Yoshio TANIGUCHI, with construction work from July 1, 2008 and completion scheduled for January 31, 2009). </p>
<p>Along with the dismantlement of the Collections Hall and the construction of Centennial Hall (tentative name), the regular exhibition was halted on December 7, 2008, and the museum will be closed except for periods of special exhibitions at the main hall (Special Exhibition Hall) (although special exhibitions will be given as usual). </p>
