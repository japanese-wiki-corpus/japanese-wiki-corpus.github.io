<p>History<br/>
In April, 1890, Jinbe NISHIMURA, an oil merchant, opened 'Yoshimizuen,' a recreational amusement park, at the foot of Kacho-zan Mountain. He opened Miyako Hotel within the park in 1900. Since then, the hotel has kept the position of the highest-class hotel, as the guest house of Kyoto, the largest sightseeing place in Japan. In 1960, the present main hall designed by Togo MURANO was completed. </p>
<p>In April of 2002, Miyako Hotel started a business partnership with Starwood Hotels & Resorts, participating in the Westin brand, and the hotel name was changed to the present one. Corresponding to the start of the partnership, the hotel was drastically renovated, and newly opened. With the Starwood's world-wide member organization and reservation system, foreign guests staying at the hotel, whose number was small before, increased rapidly to 1/4 of all guests staying overnight, and the average room-occupying rate was also increased from 60% (before the start of the business partnership) to 80%. It appeared on the Kyoto Shimbun Newspaper on December 6, 2005. </p>
<p>Facilities<br/>
The Aoi-den garden spreading in the south of the Aoi-den banquet hall is a walk-through type, one designed in 1933 by Jihe OGAWA, famous as a pioneer of modern Japanese gardens. The Kasui-en garden was built in 1925 by Hakuyo, the eldest son of the seventh Jihe OGAWA, imitating the garden of Sanbo-in of Daigo-ji Temple in Fushimi Ward, Kyoto City. Both the Aoi-den garden and the Kasui-en garden were designated cultural properties (beauty spots) in 1994 by Kyoto City. </p>
<p>Kasui-en,' a Japanese style annex designed by Togo MURANO and completed within the Kasui-en garden in 1959, is known as a masterpiece of sukiya-zukuri style buildings after the war. In Kasui-en, you can enjoy services of traditional Japanese inns while staying in the hotel. </p>
