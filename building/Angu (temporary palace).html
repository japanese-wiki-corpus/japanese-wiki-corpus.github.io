<h1>Angu (temporary palace) (行宮)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Angu (also called karimiya) refers to facilities built or used as a temporary palace in situations such as when an emperor pays a visit somewhere, or the imperial palace falls because of a political change and so on. Angu is also called anzaisho, gozasho or tongu. </p>
<p>The first angu appeared in Japanese history when Emperor Jinmu built one in Kibi Province while he was on his journey to conquer the east (eastern expedition of Emperor Jinmu, called Jinmu tosei). This angu is called Takashimanomiya. </p>
<p>Some shrines also have angu. </p>
