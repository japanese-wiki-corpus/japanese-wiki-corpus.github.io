<h1>Gojo-ohashi Bridge (五条大橋)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Gojo-ohashi Bridge is a bridge over the Kamo-gawa River which runs through Kyoto City, Kyoto Prefecture. Gojo-dori Street (National Route 1) runs on the bridge. It is also on the boundary between Shimogyo Ward and Higashiyama Ward. </p>
<p>There is a great view of Mt. Hiei and other mountains from this bridge. Gojo-ohashi Bridge is famous for the legendary story of Musashibo Benkei and MINAMOTO no Yoshitsune, and their stone statues in the style of a Kyoto doll or Kyo-ningyo (gosho-ningyo) stand in the green belt on the west side of the bridge close to the cross-section of Kawaramachi-dori Street and Gojo-dori Street. </p>
<p>However, Gojo-dori Street during the Heian period has become the present Matsubara-dori Street, and one theory suggests the 'Gojo-no-hashi' bridge of that time used to be near the present Matsubara-bashi Bridge, and another theory proposes that it was Nishinotoin-dori Street as no bridge was over the Kamo-gawa River. </p>
<p>At the foot of Gojo-ohashi Bridge on the northwestern side stands Ogizuka (literally, a fan mound) after the Mieido (Shinzenko-ji Temple) fans that used be produced here. </p>
<p>Underground at the east side of the bridge is Gojo Station (Keihan) run by the Keihan Electric Railway Co., Ltd. Gojo-dori Street extends eastward to Gojo-zaka Slope which leads to Nishi-otani and Kiyomizu-dera Temple. </p>
