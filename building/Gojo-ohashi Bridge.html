<h1>Gojo-ohashi Bridge (五条大橋)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Gojo-ohashi Bridge is a bridge over the Kamo-gawa River which runs through <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Gojo-dori Street.html">Gojo-dori Street</a> (National Route 1) runs on the bridge. It is also on the boundary between <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Shimogyo Ward.html">Shimogyo Ward</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Higashiyama Ward.html">Higashiyama Ward</a>. </p>
<p>There is a great view of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Mt. Hiei.html">Mt. Hiei</a> and other mountains from this bridge. Gojo-ohashi Bridge is famous for the legendary story of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Musashibo Benkei.html">Musashibo Benkei</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Yoshitsune.html">MINAMOTO no Yoshitsune</a>, and their stone statues in the style of a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> doll or Kyo-ningyo (gosho-ningyo) stand in the green belt on the west side of the bridge close to the cross-section of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Kawaramachi-dori Street.html">Kawaramachi-dori Street</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Gojo-dori Street.html">Gojo-dori Street</a>. </p>
<p>However, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Gojo-dori Street.html">Gojo-dori Street</a> during the Heian period has become the present <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Matsubara-dori Street.html">Matsubara-dori Street</a>, and one theory suggests the 'Gojo-no-hashi' bridge of that time used to be near the present Matsubara-bashi Bridge, and another theory proposes that it was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Nishinotoin-dori Street.html">Nishinotoin-dori Street</a> as no bridge was over the Kamo-gawa River. </p>
<p>At the foot of Gojo-ohashi Bridge on the northwestern side stands Ogizuka (literally, a fan mound) after the Mieido (Shinzenko-ji Temple) fans that used be produced here. </p>
<p>Underground at the east side of the bridge is <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Gojo Station.html">Gojo Station</a> (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Keihan.html">Keihan</a>) run by the Keihan Electric Railway Co., Ltd. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Gojo-dori Street.html">Gojo-dori Street</a> extends eastward to Gojo-zaka Slope which leads to Nishi-otani and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Kiyomizu-dera Temple.html">Kiyomizu-dera Temple</a>. </p>
