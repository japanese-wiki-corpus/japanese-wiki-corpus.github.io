<h1>Kyo-yashiki residence (京屋敷)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kyo-yashiki residences were Hantei (residence) maintained in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">Daimyo</a> (feudal lord) of Han (domains) in the Edo period. </p>

</p>
<p>While the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Edo bakufu.html">Edo bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>) did not want <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">Daimyo</a> of domains to contact the Imperial court, it maintained the Nijo-jodai (the keeper of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Nijo-jo Castle.html">Nijo-jo Castle</a>)/the Nijo zaiban (resident officer of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">Bakufu</a>) and the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shoshidai.html">shoshidai</a> (the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">Bakufu</a> military governor stationed in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>)/the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Gundai.html">gundai</a> (rural intendants) in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> which was the center base of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Edo bakufu.html">Edo bakufu</a> for controlling the Saigoku (western part of Japan (esp. Kyushu, but ranging as far east as Kinki)), and there were many of Kyo-yashiki residences in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. At the stage of 1637, 68 of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> yashiki (mansion of a feudal lord) (including 48 of the Saigoku <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a>'s)/over 60 of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daikan (local governor).html">Daikan</a>'s (rural intendants) and other Buke-yashiki (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> residence) were identified. </p>
<p>The situations regarding the Kyo-yashiki residences varied greatly between the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/family/Shinpan (Tokugawas relatives).html">Shinpan</a> (relatives of the Tokugawa family)/Fudai (hereditary) <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> and the Tozama <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> (nonhereditary feudal lord). The former had their Kyo-yashiki around the periphery of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Nijo-jo Castle.html">Nijo-jo Castle</a>, the core of the control of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">Bakufu</a>, because they lived in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> sometimes as a place for their assignments by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">Bakufu</a>. The Kyo-yashiki of the Tozama <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a>, contrarily, were allowed to maintain only low-level officials such as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Rusui (a governmental post placed in the Edo bakufu and in domains).html">Rusui</a> (caretaker or keeper (official post in the Edo era)) and in some cases, the management of a Kyo-yashiki was entrusted to a purveyor. In addition, most of the land for the Kyo-yashiki residences was purchased by domains which desired to maintain the residences, so the taxes like the Nokiyaku tax/Yakugin tax were imposed as in the case of the general townspeople without exemption. </p>
<p>Some of the reasons why the Kyo-yashiki residences were maintained despite such situations were the facts that <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> was a representative production district of Japan for artifacts and also the center of learning/culture even in the particular period when the political power of the Imperial court fell down. Also, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> had many of consumers in each social class, from the Court noble, the Buddhist monk to the commercial and industrial men, and was developed in the financial business. The Kyo-yashiki residences played a role in purchasing high-level artifacts of each domain, collecting the knowledge/information on ceremonies and rites, promoting the sale of the products of their own domains and financial dealings like borrowing from merchants, and so on which were close to the role of the Kurayashiki (Warehouse-residence) in Osaka. </p>
<p>At the end of the Edo period, the Imperial court movements came to influence the domestic and international situation, so lords/senior vassals/patriots of Han (domains) started such political activities as the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kobu Gattai (Alliance between Imperial Court and Shogunate).html">Kobu Gattai</a> (Union of Court and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">Bakufu</a>) movement and the Sonno Joi Movement (a movement advocating reverence for the Emperor and the expulsion of foreigners), etc. based in Kyo-yashiki residences. Some powerful Han (domains) tried to cope with the changing of political situations by equipping themselves with military capabilities moving their Hantei to some large plot of land in the suburbs. </p>
