<h1>Maizuru Repatriation Memorial Museum (舞鶴引揚記念館)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The Maizuru Repatriation Memorial Museum is a facility for preservation of historical artifacts and tradition in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Maizuru City.html">Maizuru City</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a><br/>
</p>
<p>The Port of Kyoto-Maizuru functioned as a military base for the Imperial Navy, and after the war the port was designated as one of the ports of entry for repatriated soldiers and people from mainland China as well as the departure <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Point (Sentoki).html">point</a> for Chinese and Koreans who had been expatriates in Japan. Also, former soldiers who had been illegally detained in Siberia by Soviet army, which unilaterally breached Soviet-Japanese Neutrality Pact and invaded, returned to Japan through this port. Because other ports had been removed from the designation for repatriations at an early stage, nearly all these repatriated people arrived at the Port of Kyoto-Maizuru. For this reason, many people who had anxiously longed for the return of their husbands, fathers, sons and relatives came to this port from all over Japan to welcome them. </p>
<p>Many concerned people helped to establish the Maizuru Repatriation Memorial Museum in 1988 as Japan's only facility for the exhibition of materials concerning the repatriation. Repatriation Memorial Park was created on a hill overlooking the Taira district, where landing bridges for repatriates had been placed, and the Memorial Museum was built in a corner of the park. </p>
<p>In 2005, the sixtieth anniversary of the repatriation, several memorial events were held on and around November 7, which was the date the first repatriation ship arrived at the port. </p>
