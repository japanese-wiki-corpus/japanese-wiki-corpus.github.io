<h1>Shoro (a tower housing a big Buddhist bell) (鐘楼)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Shoro or shuro, in which bonsho (a big Buddhist bell) is hung, is placed on the premises of a temple and is used for informing people in the neighborhood of the time by ringing the bell. It is also called Kanetsukido (a place where a big Buddhist bell is to be struck) or Shorodo (a temple housing such a bell). </p>
<p>The term of Shoro is also used for indicating a similar facility in Christian-related buildings (such as in churches and chapels). </p>
<p><h3>In Japan</h3>
</p>
<p>During the Muroyama period in Japan, some shoro were integrated with the san-mon gates (the gateways to their temples), becoming sho-mon gates (gateways housing big Buddhist bells). </p>
<p>However, for the purpose of informing time, similar facilities are also installed outside religious places, for example, on the premises of government offices. </p>
<p>On the temple premises of Nanto Rokushu (the six Buddhist sects initially based in the Nara capital), a shoro is located in front of or behind a lecture hall but is slightly deviated from the center line of the hall. It is built facing a sutra repository. <h3>Major shoro</h3>
