<h1>Kyoto Aquarena (京都アクアリーナ)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kyoto Aquarena is a municipal indoor swimming pool and skating rink in Kyoto City Nishikyogoku Comprehensive Sports Park in Ukyo Ward, Kyoto City, Kyoto Prefecture. It opened on July 20, 2002. Following the appointment of the Designated Manager System into the Kyoto City in April 2006, Viva Sports Academy Corporation began running and managing the facility. </p>
<p><h3>History</h3>
</p>
<p>The Kyoto Aquarena was opened as a swimming pool at the Kyoto City's playground (later known as the Kyoto City Nishikyogoku Comprehensive Sports Park) in 1944. The facility, however, was removed when the Kyoto City playground was completely renovated in 1982 for the National Sports Festival in Kyoto. Construction of the Kyoto Aquarena began in 1999, and the facility was completed in July 2002. The building was jointly designed by Mitsuru SENDA and Norihiko DAN. The total construction cost was 35 billion yen. <h3>Facility</h3>
