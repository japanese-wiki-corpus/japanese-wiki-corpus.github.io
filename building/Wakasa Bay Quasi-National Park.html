<h1>Wakasa Bay Quasi-National Park (若狭湾国定公園)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Wakasa Bay Quasi-National Park was designated as covering an area which includes the coastline around Wakasa Bay from the left bank of the mouth of the Shono-kawa River in Tsuruga City, Fukui Prefecture, to the right bank of the mouth of the Yura-gawa River in Maizuru City, Kyoto Prefecture. In August 2007, its total area was 191,940,000 square meters. It had once covered the northern part of Tango Peninsula in Kyotango City, Kyoto Prefecture, but now the area of the Yura-gawa River and to the west is part of Tango-Amanohashidate-Oeyama Quasi-National Park. </p>
<p>Summary<br/>
The sawtooth coastline facing Wakasa Bay is popular among tourists with its varied views of cliffs, rock tunnels, caves and reefs. The park covers the following: the area around the coastline of Wakasa Bay, Kanmuri-jima Island and Kutsu-jima Island which are specially protected areas within the bay, Mikata Marine park, Mikata Goko (Five Lakes of Mikata), a wetland designated by the Ramsar Convention, and its neighborhood. </p>
