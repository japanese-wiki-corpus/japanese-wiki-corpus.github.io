<h1>Naramachi (a preservation district of historic buildings in Nara City, Nara Prefecture) (ならまち)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Naramachi is a preservation district having groups of historic buildings that extends over the south of the present urban area of Nara City, Nara Prefecture. Streets in this area are lined with machiya (merchant's house) built in the Edo, Meiji, and the early Showa period. </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>Naramachi originally developed as an extension of Nara Capital Heijo-kyo where numerous temples and shrines were located. After the transfer of the national capital to Nagaoka-kyo, there were times that Naramachi fell into a decline but, subsequently, it gradually became a booming area being the temple town of Todai-ji Temple and Kasuga-Taisha Shrine. In the Edo period, various businesses (such as making brushes, ink, mosquito nets, bleached cotton cloth, futon (Japanese-style bedding), swords, sake liquor and soy sauce) developed on the premises of Gango-ji Temple which is now registered as the world heritage. This area consequently evolved into a city of commerce and industry representative of the Edo period. According to the survey performed by ongoku-bugyo (the collective name of the magistrates placed at important areas directly controlled by the government in the Edo period) at the end of the 17th century, the population of Naramachi was 35,000. </p>
<p>Having escaped the air raid during the World War II, Naramachi flourished as the former urban district of Nara City after the war and, in April 1990, the area was designated as 'the Naramachi Urban Landscape Formation Area' (approximately 48.1ha) in accordance with the Nara City Landscape Conservation Regulation. </p>
<p>In the latter half of the 20th century, efforts to conserve machiya buildings became active and, in 1984, Nara Machizukuri Center (NMC) was established. Restaurants and general stores that were the refurbished machiya to offer modern features while maintaining their original form, public cultural facilities, temples and shrines began to dot various areas of the town. Naramachi consequently started to attract attention as a new tourist area in Nara and, nowadays, its labyrinth of narrow alleys are busy with visitors who enjoy the historical ambience of the town. The Urban Development Think Tank consisting mainly of the area residents was the first of its kind in Japan, being the groundbreaking case to set a precedent for the subsequent urban development movement in various regions. </p>
<p>'Naramachi,' incidentally, is a common name of the area and there is no administrative district under that name. </p>
<p>Since the Edo period, it has been sometimes said that residents in this area are early risers. It was based on the background that, back in those days, if a deer, which was regarded as a divine messenger, was found dead in front of someone's house by officials, it constituted an offense whereby they would face a serious charge or be punished by a fine of three mon (an old currency unit in Japan). The area residents consequently came to get up early to check to see if there was no dead deer in front of their houses before the officials began to make the rounds of the town. It is said that the proverbial phrase saying, 'Early risers stand to gain three mon' originated from this matter. <h3>Alluring Factors</h3>
</p>
<p>Attraction of Naramachi is that lifestyle and cultural tradition of its residents have been ingrained in the character of the locality for generations and the livelihood of ordinary people that remain vibrant today. As a result, there are numerous neighborhoods with rich and pleasant ambience which resonates in one's heart whereby attracting the deep-seated popularity of admirers who appreciate the restfulness emanating from the things of the past that were marked with the spirit of the communities of Naramachi. <h3>Main Points of Interest</h3>
