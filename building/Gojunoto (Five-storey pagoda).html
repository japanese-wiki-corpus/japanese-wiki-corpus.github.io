<h1>Gojunoto (Five-storey pagoda) (五重塔)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The Gojunoto is one of the styles of Buddhist pagodas. Buddhist pagodas, of many types, in the Rokaku (pavilion) style called 'Soto' with five roofs are called 'Gojunoto' (five-storey pagoda). </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>The Buddhist pagoda has its roots in the stupa that was made to worship Busshari (Buddha's relics) in ancient India in the third century B.C. A stupa in ancient India was a hemispherical mound, and its style spread to China to become multi-storey architecture taking on the style of Rokaku. This Rokaku-style Soto was introduced to Japan via Korean Peninsula. Many of wooden Soto remain in Japan, with a few in China and Korean Peninsula. </p>
<p>Local Buddhist temples and shrines have wooden Gojunoto and Sanjunoto (three-storey pagoda) in Japan, many of which are landmarks of their regions. Other than wood, they are also made of stone, tiles, and iron, and in the modern days there are ferroconcrete pagodas. Although multi-storey pagoda architecture also include Nanajunoto (Seven-storey pagoda), Kujunoto (Nine-storey pagoda), and Jusanjunoto (Thirteen-storey pagoda) (mostly limited to odd numbers), wooden Nanajunoto or Kujunoto do not exit. Tanzan-jinja Shrine in Nara Prefecture has a wooden Jusanjunoto, but it is not in the Rokaku style, because its eaves of the second to the thirteenth roof are close together leaving little space between them. An antenna-like part on the rooftop is called 'Sorin' (a metal pinnacle). </p>
<p>Compared to many Chinese Soto whose top storey one can climb up to, Japanese wooden Gojunoto do not allow one to climb, because they are not precisely five-storey in a modern sense, but they have complicated timberworks inside supporting the eaves (some are equipped with a ladder inside). Today, some of them are constructed with no religious purposes, and their miniature models are sold. </p>
<p>The multi-storey architecture was aimed at letting ordinary people who were not allowed to enter the precincts, worship from a distance. </p>

Earthquake resistant towers use the theory of 'flexible structure' which is applied to the designs of super-high-rise buildings not only in Japan but in the world today. However, the secrets of the structure of ancient Japanese Gojunoto and Sanjunoto are not fully mechanically explained yet. The true mechanism of Gojunoto is not revealed yet regarding its earthquake resistance structure in which a central pillar stands independently without contacting other parts of the building, despite experiments on the quake-resistance strength of accurately simulated models are conducted. </p>
<p>A carpenter named Jubei whose life was dedicated to building a Gojunoto, is depicted in a novel "Gojunoto," one of the representative works of 'Rohan KODA,' a novelist of the Meiji period. Gojunoto in the novel is modeled after the Gojunoto of Yanaka Tenno-ji Temple (commonly called Yanaka no Gojunoto). This Gojunoto survived the Great Kanto Earthquake and the Great Tokyo Air Raids, but was destroyed by the incident of arson-double suicide at Yanaka no Gojunoto in July 1957. </p>
<p>In a film starring Bruce LEE, Game of Death was made with a plot that the hero fights a battle with each enemy on each floor of a Gojunoto as he ascends it. </p>
<p>There is a species of plant called Gojunoto (Haworthia Viscosa, Liliaceae family) which is a succulent plant (a plant with fat leaves, such as Aloe). </p>
<p>Although its correct notation is Gojunoto '五重塔' in Chinese characters, brochures of some temples show a notation '五重の塔.'<br/>
