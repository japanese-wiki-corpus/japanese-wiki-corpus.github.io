<p></p>
<p>Itabuki no Miya was an Imperial Palace where <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Empress Kogyoku..html">Empress Kogyoku</a> lived in about the middle of the seventh century. It is generally called <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Asuka (飛鳥 in Chinese characters, the name of present-day Asuka Village, Nara Prefecture).html">Asuka</a> no Itabuki no Miya. It was reportedly located in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Asuka-kyo (the Capital of Asuka).html">Asuka-kyo</a> (an ancient capital of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Asuka (飛鳥 in Chinese characters, the name of present-day Asuka Village, Nara Prefecture).html">Asuka</a>) Site in Oka, Asuka Village, Nara Prefecture. </p>
<p><h3>Details</h3>
</p>
<p>In February 642, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Empress Kogyoku..html">Empress Kogyoku</a> ascended the throne succeeding her husband, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Jomei.html">Emperor Jomei</a> who had died and on October 20, in the same year, she ordered Oomi (a highest officer in national politics of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yamato.html">Yamato</a> dynasty) <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/SOGA no Emishi.html">SOGA no Emishi</a> to construct a new Palace by December. A palace was completed as Itabuki no Miya Palace. She moved into the Palace in April 643. </p>
<p>Itabuki no Miya Palace became the setting for a coup (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Isshi Incident.html">Isshi Incident</a> [the Murder in the Year of Isshi]) which occurred on July 13, 645. On this day, an act of violence to stab to death <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/SOGA no Iruka.html">SOGA no Iruka</a>, the inheritor to the Oomi was committed in front of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Empress Kogyoku..html">Empress Kogyoku</a>. Due to this, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Empress Kogyoku..html">Empress Kogyoku</a> abdicated the throne on the 15 of the same month and it was decided that Prince Karu who was regarded as the real leader of the coups ascend the throne (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Kotoku..html">Emperor Kotoku</a>). <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Kotoku..html">Emperor Kotoku</a> set up his palace in Naniwa no Nagara no Toyosaki. </p>
<p>After <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Kotoku..html">Emperor Kotoku</a> died at <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Naniwa no Miya (an ancient palace in the Asuka and Nara periods in present Chuo Ward, Osaka City).html">Naniwa no Miya</a> in November 654, the retired <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Empress Kogyoku..html">Empress Kogyoku</a> ascended the throne again (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Choso.html">Choso</a> [a second accession to the imperial throne]) at Itabuki no Miya Palace early in the following year, becoming Empress Saimei. At the end of that year, a fire broke out at Itabuki no Miya Palace, which was burnt down. Empress Saimei moved into Kawahara no Miya Palace. <h3>Name</h3>
</p>
<p>Furthermore, the name, 'Itabuki no Miya' (shingle roofed palace) is said to derive from the fact that the palace was actually roofed with shingle (thick and luxurious shingle). By the above fact, it becomes clear that most of the houses at that time were thatched with grass, kaya-grass or straw and houses with shingle-covered roof were rare. Incidentally, temples at that time were roofed with tiles. <h3>Current situation</h3>
</p>
<p>As of today, what considered to be a part of the center of the Palace remains in Asuka Village, Nara Prefecture. </p>
<p>In addition, there is Kubi-zuka (burial mound for heads) of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/SOGA no Iruka.html">SOGA no Iruka</a> nearby. </p>
