<h1>Yuminoki-jo Castle (弓木城)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Yuminoki-jo Castle was a castle in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Tango Province.html">Tango Province</a> (present-day Iwataki, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Yosano-cho (Yosano Town).html">Yosano-cho</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>). </p>
<p>The Inatomi clan built the castle at the end of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period, and made it their residence for generations. </p>
<p>During the Warring State period, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshisada ISSHIKI.html">Yoshisada ISSHIKI</a>, a child of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshimichi ISSHIKI.html">Yoshimichi ISSHIKI</a>, was attacked by Tadaoki HOSAKAWA. Consequently, Yoshisada moved from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Takebeyama-jo Castle.html">Takebeyama-jo Castle</a> to Yuminoki-jo Castle. From the following year, the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/family/Hosokawa clan.html">Hosokawa clan</a> repeatedly attacked the Yuminoki-jo Castle, but the lord of the castle, Sukenao INATOMI continued to repel them with a small force. He kept on resisting until <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshisada ISSHIKI.html">Yoshisada ISSHIKI</a> was murdered by the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/family/Hosokawa clan.html">Hosokawa clan</a>. It is said that the castle was relinquished as a result of peace negotiations after Yoshisada's death. </p>
<p>The castle is categorized as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Yamajiro (mountain castles).html">yamajiro</a> (a castle built on a mountain to take advantage of the mountain's topography), and the ruins of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Kuruwa (Castle compound).html">kuruwa</a> (walls of a castle), a karabori (a dry moat) and dorui (earthen walls for fortification) remain. </p>
