<h1>The Mizuki (an ancient water fortress in Fukuoka Prefecture) (水城)</h1>
<p>The Mizuki was a defense facility built in the mid-seventh century. It stretched from current Onojo City to Dazaifu City, Fukuoka Prefecture. </p>
<p>It was designated as a historic site, Mizuki-ato (the Mizuki remains) on March 3, 1921. The designated area of the site is 150,805.80 square meters. </p>
<p><h3>History</h3>
</p>
<p>According to the "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan).html">Nihonshoki</a>" (Chronicles of Japan) cited as follows, there was a grave concern for safety assurance in the background of the construction of the Mizuki. </p>
<p>In 663, Japan, supporting Paekche, was defeated the allied forces of Tang dynasty and Shilla in Korean Peninsula (the Battle of Hakusonko). </p>
<p>At that time, Prince Naka no Oe ruled without official accession to the Chrysanthemum Throne<br/>
He had the Mizuki build in 664, the following year, expecting Tang and Shilla invade Dazaifu further from Hakata-wan bay. </p>
<p>In the following year, 665, he ordered to build <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kodai Sanjo (ancient castles built on the top of mountains).html">Kodai Sanjo</a> (ancient Korean-style mountain castles) from Northern Kyushu to the coast of the Inland Sea including <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Ono-jo Castle (an ancient mountaintop castle in Chikuzen Province).html">Ono-jo Castle</a> (Chikuzen Province), Kii-jo Castle and Nagatonoki Castle. </p>
<p>He transferred the capital to an inland area, Omi Otsu no Miya, in 667. </p>
<p>The beginning of the following year, Prince Naka no Oe finally ascended throne as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Tenchi (Tenji).html">Emperor Tenchi</a>. </p>
<p>In later years, at the Bunei War (the first Mongolian Invasion) in 1274, the Mizuki was renovated as a defense line against the Mongol army. However, the fortress never became a battlefield. </p>
<p>Structure and intended purpose<br/>
</p>
<p>The Mizuki is made of a linear moat and dorui (earthen walls for fortification), which used to work as defense line to protect Dazaifu from attacks from Hakata-wan bay. The dorui was more than 10 meters high, 80 meters wide, and 1.2 kilometers long. The moat on Hakata-wan bay side was 60 meters wide and 4 meters in depth, and filled with water. It is confirmed that there was two openings and gates at the dorui as a result of an excavation. Inside the dorui, there was a wooden gutter for letting water run through the moat from the Mikasa-gawa River. </p>
<p>On the place above ridge in southwest, there is a dorui of 80 meters long called Komizuki (small Mizuki) today. This is considered as the fortress to protect Dazaifu, together with the Mizuki in the main portion. <h3>Another opinion of the intended purpose of Mizuki</h3>
</p>
<p>There is another opinion of the intended purpose of the Mizuki: It was not a mere castle wall, but it was for emergency. The opinion is that the Mizuki was used to keep water back from the Mikasa-gawa River, and washed out enemy who entered the outside dry moat. However, the opinion is seen as lack in persuasiveness because there was gates and a wooden gutter inconvenient for keeping water back and the existence of Komizuki. </p>
<p>Names still used today<br/>
There is a station called 'Mizuki Station' on Kagoshima Main Line of Kyushu Railway Company (JR Kyushu). </p>
<p>In Dazaifu City, there is a place called 'Mizuki.'<br/>
</p>
<p>In Onojo City, there is a place called 'Komizuki.'<br/>
</p>
<p>There is a temple of the Jinmon-ryu school of Hokkeshu sect called 'Suijo-ji Temple' in Hiratadai, Kasuga City. </p>
