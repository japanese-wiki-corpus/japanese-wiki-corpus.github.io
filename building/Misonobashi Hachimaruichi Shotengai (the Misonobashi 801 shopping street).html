<h1>Misonobashi Hachimaruichi Shotengai (the Misonobashi 801 shopping street) (御薗橋801商店街)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Located in the northernmost place in Kyoto, Misonobashi Hachimaruichi Shotengai (the Misonobashi 801 shopping street) it's length is 800m to the west from Misonobashi-nishizume (the west end of Misono-bashi Bridge), Kita Ward, Kyoto City<br/>
The name of the shopping street comes from its length of 800m plus 1 which was added intending further expansion in the future. </p>
<p>Nearby are the, Kyoto Sangyo University, Kamigamo-jinja Shrine, a world heritage property, Nishigamo, Jinko-in Temple and Kamo-gawa River. </p>
<p>801-chan (pronounced as Yaoichi-chan),' the mascot designed for the shopping street by students of Kyoto Seika University imaging a Kyoto-specific eggplant, has now been made official by the street, because "Tonari no 801 (Yaoi)-chan," a spin-off manga (cartoon) in which 'Yaoi' is also used for suggesting 'Yaoi' meaning a male-homosexual-love-dealing product for females, has become very popular. </p>
