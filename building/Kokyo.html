<p>Kokyo (Imperial Palace) is the residence of the Emperor during normal times. </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>These days, the former site of Edo-jo Castle in Tokyo is called Kokyo, which was formally called Kyujo (place where the Emperor lives) but the name was abolished after World War II. 
<br/>The name in English is 'The Imperial Palace.'<br/>
It includes 'Gosho,' where the Emperor lives, '<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kyuden.html">Kyuden</a>,' where various public events and government affairs are conducted, and the office building of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Imperial Household Agency.html">Imperial Household Agency</a>. Refer to the item of Kokyo in Tokyo. </p>
<p>Kokyo in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> was called <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Kyoto Gosho (Kyoto Imperial Palace).html">Kyoto Gosho</a>, Kinri (Imperial Palace), and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Dairi (the Imperial palace).html">Dairi</a> (Imperial Palace) and, after the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Tokyo Gyoko (Imperial visit to Tokyo).html">Tokyo Gyoko</a> (Emperor's going out to Tokyo) of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Meiji Restoration (Meiji-ishin).html">Meiji Restoration</a>, became empty and came to be called the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> kogu Imperial Palace after it came to be maintained under the Emperor's order. 
<br/>The name in English is 'Kyoto Imperial Palace.'<br/>
Shishin-den Hall (hall for state ceremonies), (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Seiden.html">Seiden</a> (main palace)) of the highest social status which has handed down the style of the Heian period, and Tsune-goten (private palace), which was the place for daily life, have been maintained. Refer to the item of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Kyoto Gosho (Kyoto Imperial Palace).html">Kyoto Gosho</a>. </p>
<p>There are such a large number of popular names for Kokyo (Imperial Palace) as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Dairi (the Imperial palace).html">Dairi</a>, Gosho, Ouchi, Ouchiyama, Kokonoe, Kyuchu, Kinchu, Kinri, Momoshiki, Murasaki no niwa, Kogu, Kojo, Kyujo, Yomogigahora, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Omiya (The Tale of Genji).html">Omiya</a>, Kumo no ue, and Kumoi. <h3>History</h3>
</p>
<p>The word, 宮 (Miya) is made of 家 (ya '屋') and the honorific title (Mi '御'). It started as a word meaning a residence of a person in a high position and over time came to mean a palace of the Emperor or the Imperial Family. In ancient times, Imperial residences were relocated by generations and Kokyo referred to a palace which was called Miya. "<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Kojiki (The Records of Ancient Matters).html">Kojiki</a>" (The Records of Ancient Matters) and "<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan).html">Nihonshoki</a>" (Chronicles of Japan) describe that many palaces were located in the southeast part of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Nara Basin.html">Nara Basin</a> from the 4th century to the 6th century. <h3><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Asuka (飛鳥 in Chinese characters, the name of present-day Asuka Village, Nara Prefecture).html">Asuka</a> no miya (Imperial Palaces in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Asuka (飛鳥 in Chinese characters, the name of present-day Asuka Village, Nara Prefecture).html">Asuka</a>)</h3>
</p>
<p>During the period of approx. 100 years from 592, when Emperor <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Suiko.html">Suiko</a> ascended the throne at Toyura no miya Imperial residence, to 694, when <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Empress Jito.html">Empress Jito</a> transferred the capital to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Fujiwara-kyo.html">Fujiwara-kyo</a> (the ancient capital of Fujiwara), Imperial palaces were located in a concentrated manner in and around the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Asuka (飛鳥 in Chinese characters, the name of present-day Asuka Village, Nara Prefecture).html">Asuka</a> region, which was in the south of Nara, so it is sometimes called <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Asuka-kyo (the Capital of Asuka).html">Asuka-kyo</a> (the ancient capital of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Asuka (飛鳥 in Chinese characters, the name of present-day Asuka Village, Nara Prefecture).html">Asuka</a>). Some of the Imperial Palaces as above were Oharida no miya (603-630), <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Asuka (飛鳥 in Chinese characters, the name of present-day Asuka Village, Nara Prefecture).html">Asuka</a> no Okamoto no miya (630-636), Itabuki no miya (643-655), Nochi no <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Asuka (飛鳥 in Chinese characters, the name of present-day Asuka Village, Nara Prefecture).html">Asuka</a> no Okamoto no miya (656-672), and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Asuka (飛鳥 in Chinese characters, the name of present-day Asuka Village, Nara Prefecture).html">Asuka</a> no Kiyomihara no miya (672-694). Some of the large-scale residences at the time have been found. Those were Hottate bashira (earthfast post) structures which were built with posts fixed at their bases in holes dug into the ground. Among these, major structures after the 7th century characteristically made their south side the front. </p>
<p>Later, Miyako (capital) came to be constructed under the influence of the Chinese dynasties, and the Emperors settled down in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Dairi (the Imperial palace).html">Dairi</a> (Imperial Palaces), which were taken up as Kokyo. The central government office including Chodo-in (an office at the Heijo-kyo Palace), the center of affairs of state, was built side by side with <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Dairi (the Imperial palace).html">Dairi</a>, and the complex was collectively called Kyujo. </p>
<p>Naniwa-kyo (Osaka), <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Fujiwara-kyo.html">Fujiwara-kyo</a> (Nara), <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Heijo-kyo.html">Heijo-kyo</a> (Nara), and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Heian-kyo.html">Heian-kyo</a> (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>) all served as miyako. <h3>From the Heian period to the Edo period</h3>
</p>
<p><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Heian-kyo.html">Heian-kyo</a> was established by Emperor Kanmu in 794. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Dairi (the Imperial palace).html">Dairi</a> was destroyed by fire in 960 and until reconstruction, Reizei-in imperial villa was taken up as the temporary Kokyo. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Dairi (the Imperial palace).html">Dairi</a> was devastated again in 976, and Horikawa-dono mansion, the residence of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/FUJIWARA no Kanemichi.html">FUJIWARA no Kanemichi</a>, was taken up as the temporary Kokyo. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Dairi (the Imperial palace).html">Dairi</a> in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Heian-kyo.html">Heian-kyo</a> frequently burnt down; residences of the retainers, including Sekkan (regents and advisers), and the maternal relatives were often taken up as the temporary Kokyo (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Satodairi (temporary imperial palace).html">Satodairi</a>). Since the end of the Heian period, it came to be the usual practice to take up <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Satodairi (temporary imperial palace).html">Satodairi</a> as Kokyo even if <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Dairi (the Imperial palace).html">Dairi</a> existed. After the Kyujo (Dai-dairi (place of the Imperial Palace and government offices)) was destroyed by fire in 1227, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Dairi (the Imperial palace).html">Dairi</a> was not reconstructed and wandered from <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Satodairi (temporary imperial palace).html">Satodairi</a> to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Satodairi (temporary imperial palace).html">Satodairi</a>. After <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Kogen.html">Emperor Kogen</a> of the Northern Court ascended the throne at <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Tsuchimikado-dono Palace.html">Tsuchimikado-dono Palace</a> in 1331 during the period of the Northern and Southern Courts, this Palace was taken up as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Dairi (the Imperial palace).html">Dairi</a>. This was called Tsuchimikado dairi Palace, which came to be the predecessor of the current <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Kyoto Gosho (Kyoto Imperial Palace).html">Kyoto Gosho</a>. <h3>After the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period</h3>
</p>
<p>Edo was renamed Tokyo in 1868, and when <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Meiji.html">Emperor Meiji</a> visited Tokyo and entered the Nishi no maru (a castle compound to the west of the main compound) of Edo-jo Castle (At present only a palace exists; it is a different place from the current site of the Fukiage gosho (old imperial palace of Fukiage)), the Castle was also renamed Tokyo-jo Castle and was taken up as the temporary Kokyo during the Emperor's visit to the east, after which the Emperor went back briefly to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. </p>
<p>In the following year, 1869, the Emperor visited Tokyo again, and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Kyoto Gosho (Kyoto Imperial Palace).html">Kyoto Gosho</a> started to be maintained in 1877, which continues to this day. Refer to the item of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Tokyo Tento (transferring the capital).html">Tokyo Tento</a> (transfer of the national capital to Tokyo). <h3>Kokyo in Tokyo</h3>
</p>
<p>Kokyo in Tokyo is located at the former site of Edo-jo Castle, which was the castle of Tokugawa <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> until the end of the Edo period. However, Gosho, where the Emperor lives, is located in the garden area attached to Edo-jo Castle, which was called Fukiage. </p>
<p>The former Nishi no maru (a castle compound to the west of the main compound) and Fukiage Garden are separated by the Dokan-bori moat. Since Edo-jo Castle as a castle refers only to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Honmaru.html">Honmaru</a> (the keep of a castle), Ninomaru, Sannomaru and Nishi no maru (a castle compound to the west of the main compound) and the garden area to the west of the Dokan-bori moat are, to be exact, not included in Edo-jo Castle, Gosho is not located at the former site of Edo-jo Castle. </p>
<p>The inner moat of Edo-jo Castle is situated further outside and surrounds the whole area, including Fukiage Garden. The palace is located at the former site of Nishi no maru, which is within the former Edo-jo Castle. </p>
<p>Although the whole area of Kokyo is located in the center of Tokyo, it is leafy and the sidewalk surrounding the moat enjoys high popularity among joggers. The address of Kokyo is 1 Chiyoda, Chiyoda Ward, Tokyo, which is popular as a registered address. (Zip code is 100-0001) The asset value of Kokyo as a national property amounts to \218.81 billion (Based on the Diet Report Information 'Fiscal 2003 Statement on Increase and Decrease and Current Total Value of National Property'). </p>
<p>Kokyo is registered as one of the world landmarks on the satellite panoramic images program, Google Earth. <h3>History</h3>
</p>
<p>Edo-jo Castle was renamed Tokyo-jo Castle when the Emperor visited Tokyo in 1868, and was taken up as the Kokyo in Tokyo. </p>
<p>In 1869, the Emperor's stay in Tokyo was announced at his second visit to Tokyo and Tokyo-jo Castle was named Kojo (Imperial Palace). </p>
<p>Nishi no maru of Edo-jo Castle was burned down in 1873 and Akasaka Detached Palace was taken up as the temporary Kokyo. </p>
<p>In 1879, New Imperial Palace was decided to be built at Nishi-no-maru, and in 1888 Meiji Kyuden Imperial Palace was completed. After that, it was named Kyujo. </p>
<p>In the Meiji Kyuden Imperial Palace, Okukyuden, where the Emperor lived, was connected to the place for receptions/government affairs, which includes Okurumayose entrance, Hiroma (a large room occupying the full cross section of a building), <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Seiden.html">Seiden</a> (main palace), Hoo no ma Hall, East and West waiting rooms, Homeiden State Banquet Hall, and Chigusa no ma Hall. This Meiji Kyuden Imperial Palace was burned down by air raid in May 1945 during the Pacific War. After the destruction of the Meiji Kyuden Imperial Palace by fire, Emperor Showa/Empress Kojun lived temporarily in Gobunko (library) in the Ｆukiage Imperial Gardens and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kyuden.html">Kyuden</a> was temporarily set up on the top floor (3rd floor) of the office building of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Imperial Household Agency.html">Imperial Household Agency</a>. </p>
<p>After the War in 1948, the name, Kyujo was abolished and came to be called Kokyo. </p>
<p>For some time after the War, burned-out <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kyuden.html">Kyuden</a> was not reconstructed. 
<br/>As for the reason, Sukemasa IRIE, who served Emperor Showa as Grand Chamberlain, described in his book that "Okami (Emperor Showa), after the Greater East Asia War, put a stop to reconstruction of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kyuden.html">Kyuden</a> and so on burned-out in the war with the view of giving top priority to improvement of people's living standards, saying 'A new <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kyuden.html">Kyuden</a> should not be constructed when people have no houses to live in and are in poverty.'"<br/>
</p>
<p>Around the time of the first stage of the reconstruction of Japan being completed during the period from 1955 to 1964, a move to reconstruct <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kyuden.html">Kyuden</a> got active, and on the basis of the report of the Council of the Imperial Palace Construction issued in 1959, construction of new <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kyuden.html">Kyuden</a> was started in the following year, 1960. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kyuden.html">Kyuden</a> (what is called new <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kyuden.html">Kyuden</a>) was laid out to be separated from Gosho (Residence of the Emperor), unlike the Meiji Kyuden Imperial Palace, which was connected to Gosho. In 1961, Fukiage Gosho (the imperial residential palace), the residence of Emperor Showa and Empress Kojun, was completed adjacent to Gobunko in the Fukiage area in Kokyo. Construction of the new <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kyuden.html">Kyuden</a> was started at the former site of the Meiji Kyuden Imperial Palace in 1964 and completed in October 1968, and the Palace started to be used from April 1969. Fukiage Gosho was renamed Fukiage Omiya Palace as the residence of the Empress Dowager (Empress Kojun) after the death of Emperor Showa. </p>
<p>The present Emperor and Empress Michiko continued to live in Akasaka Gosho (current Togu Gosho (Crown Prince's Palace)) for some time after accession to the throne and commuted to the Imperial Palace, but started to live in the new Gosho from December 1993, which was built in a corner of the Fukiage area in Kokyo. <h3>Facilities in Kokyo</h3>
