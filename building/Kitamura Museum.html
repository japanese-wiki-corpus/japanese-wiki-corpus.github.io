<p>Kitamura Museum is a private art museum mainly devoted to antiquities and tea utensils, located in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamigyo Ward.html">Kamigyo Ward</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>. </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>In 1975, Kitamura Culture Foundation was established to store the collections of Kitamura Kinjiro (1904-1991), a businessman and tea ceremony lover, and Kitamura Museum was opened in 1977. Its collections include 14 National <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Important Cultural Properties.html">Important Cultural Properties</a>. </p>
<p>The Kitamuras are an old family who have been engaged in forestry over many generations in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Yoshino.html">Yoshino</a>, Nara Prefecture. Besides their family business of forestry, Kinjiro KITAMURA and his wife were enthusiastic about the tea ceremony and collecting works of art. Their collection includes many fine tea utensils, such as tea bowls, because they loved the tools of the tea ceremony. The collection also includes many famous paintings and pieces of calligraphy selected by Kinjiro KITAMURA, himself an outstanding master of the tea ceremony. Hanging scrolls form part of the collection, because they were probably considered tea utensils in a broad sense, to be hung in the alcove during a ceremony. </p>
<p>The garden next to his house has a view of the woods of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Higashiyama (Kyoto Prefecture).html">Higashiyama</a> area as its background, and it has two stone lanterns and a stone pagoda, which are designated National <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Important Cultural Properties.html">Important Cultural Properties</a>. <h3>Significant pieces:</h3>
