<h1>Rakushisha (落柿舎)</h1>
<p>Rakushisha (literally, a hut where persimmons fell) is a tea hut belonging to Kyorai MUKAI, a follower of Basho MATSUO, located in Sagano (Ukyo-ku Ward, Kyoto City, Kyoto Prefecture). </p>
<p>The name of Rakushisha comes from an incident when all of the persimmons, contracted to sell, fell due to a typhoon. </p>
<p>It is said that in 1691, Basho MATSUO stayed here and wrote the Saga Nikki (Saga diary). </p>
<p>The present hut was the one reconstructed by Juko INOUE, a haiku poet. </p>
