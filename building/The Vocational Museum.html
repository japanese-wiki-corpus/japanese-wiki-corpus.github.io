<h1>The Vocational Museum (私のしごと館)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The Vocational Museum provides young people with work experience, recruitment information, and vocational counseling. </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>In 1989, discussions on the need for such a facility started, and in 1992 the government completed the plan to establish it. Following cabinet decisions to prepare for the building of the facility, taken in 1995, and to implement the plan to establish it, taken in 1999, the government promoted its creation as part of the policy surrounding the 'Promotion of Youth Employment Measures' of the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare. It was built and is operated by the Employment and Human Resources Development Organization of Japan, an independent administrative institution under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare. It operates to prevent youth unemployment through the development of vocational abilities, one of the employment insurance related operations driven by the Unemployment Insurance Law. </p>
<p>It is inside <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a> and is also part of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kansai Science City.html">Kansai Science City</a> which straddles Osaka, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, and Nara Prefectures, and is located not far from the route following the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kizu-gawa River (Kyoto Prefecture).html">Kizu-gawa River</a> that has connected Osaka, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and Nara since ancient times. </p>
<p>It partially opened on March 30, 2003, and began full operations on October 4 of the same year. However, the cabinet decision of December 2007 regarding plans to streamline independent administrative institutions stated that the running of the facility should be entrusted to the private sector, and based on an evaluation by an independent committee, proposals around how it should be operated and whether it was necessary should be made within a year. As a result, its management was outsourced to the private sector in July 2008. </p>
<p>Objectives<br/>
</p>
<p>It implements various programs to prevent unemployment by fostering the occupational aspirations of young people (vocational and career education) and is one of the largest comprehensive occupational information centers in the world. </p>
<p>It contains displays where the visitor can get hands-on experience relating to various types of work, and provides and announces information regarding occupations so that high school or junior high school students can become familiar with jobs and experience them firsthand. </p>
<p>Declining motivation for work is increasingly an international social problem, and there have been growing calls for early career education in many countries. It aims to work out long-term and ongoing solutions to these problems through various techniques, such as social education by the museum, psychology (career counseling), and occupational training (development of vocational abilities). <h3>Summary of the Facility</h3>

<h3>Functions</h3>
</p>
<p>As the world's largest hands-on occupational museum (employment museum), and as a facility encouraging occupational aspirations (relating to vocational and career education), it is a large composite establishment with many elements, including museums, libraries, occupational information centers, and other facilities for events, seminars, and craftmaking. </p>
<p>It is supposed to play a central role in a comprehensive cultural facility in the urban area representing <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kansai Science City.html">Kansai Science City</a>, along with nearby Keihanna Plaza and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Kansai-kan of the National Diet Library.html">Kansai-kan of the National Diet Library</a>. </p>
<p>The Kinki region, formerly called "Kinai", was the center of Japan for an extended period, and was the center of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kamigata Bunka (Kamigata Culture).html">Kamigata Bunka</a> (Kinki Culture) during the Edo period. Today, the Kinki region, which contains Hanshin Industrial Zone, hopes to lift the human spirit by working towards building solutions to youth problems and tackling issues of declining motivation relating to working not only in Japan but in the world as well, with a particular focus on contributing to economic development based on manufacturing in Japan. <h3>History</h3>

</p>
<p>In October 2006, Kidzania Tokyo, a private facility, was opened in Japan. 
<br/>Although the Vocational Museum and Kidzania both provide minors with work experiences, there are differences between them as follows:<br/>
</p>
<p>Kidzania is a 'for-profit' private facility that opened in Mexico in 1999. The Vocational Museum has a longer history and is a 'non-profit' public facility. </p>
<p>Kidzania's main customers are children (sixth graders or younger) as its declaration suggests, 'the country of children, and by children,' and its operation in Japan aims at 'providing children with social experiences.'<br/>
Kidzania insists upon preserving the idea of the 'children's town' by setting upper and lower age limits and encouraginging parents to remain <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Apart (Apartment).html">apart</a> from their children during the experience. </p>
<p>The Vocational Museum was established in accordance with the Basic Plan for Employment Measures. It places emphasis on 'work' and provides various setups to 'learn by seeing, touching, and feeling,' as well as hands-on displays, and it aims at the comprehensive promotion of vocational aspirations (occupational and career education) for young people using every method to help them find the most appropriate jobs for them. 
<br/>It does not have any concept of a 'children's town,' but instead, it has an area called 'Jobs town.'<br/>
</p>
<p>It entertains young people and students, who are main targets, by using applications of the latest museology and amusement facilities to encourage them to have interest in 'jobs.'<br/>
</p>
<p>Kidzania's pavilion for work experience was made by reprogramming real operation manuals provided by the sponsor company into experience programs for children. It emphasizes keeping the reality of jobs in a children's world. </p>
<p>The Vocational Museum's work experience zones are largely operated by industry organizations. <h3>Access</h3>
