<h1>Kyoto International Conference Center (国立京都国際会館)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kyoto International Conference Center is an international conference hall located in Takaragaike, Sakyo Ward, Kyoto City. </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>In 1966, it was built as Japan's first national convention facility. Before this conference center was built, the new Kyoto Station for the Tokaido Shinkansen which was constructed next to the original Kyoto Station started operation, and Kyoto City and the local business community saw the importance of access to this facility as a major factor. 
<br/>* Refer to Kyoto Station (the Tokaido Shinkansen) in Railways and Politics<br/>
</p>
<p>Many significant international conferences were held at this hall, including: The 3rd Conference of the Parties (COP) (Kyoto Conference) of The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) which adopted the Kyoto Protocol, The United Nations Conference on Disarmament, The Plenipotentiary Conference of the International Telecommunication Union (ITU), The Annual Meeting of the International Whaling Commission (IWC) and its Scientific Committee, The Conferences of the Parties of Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (Washington Convention), The World Heritage Committee Session, and The Asia-Europe Meeting (ASEM). </p>
<p>The Kyoto Conference of Junior Chamber International Japan is held every January, and the award ceremony of the Kyoto Prize hosted by the Inamori Foundation, and the related commemorative speeches are held here every November. </p>
<p>This place is also known as the turn-around point for the Inter-Prefectural Women's Ekiden held every January, and the National High School Ekiden (for men) which is held every December. </p>
