<h1>Aminochoshiyama-kofun Tumulus (網野銚子山古墳)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Amino Choshiyama-kofun Tumulus is a keyhole-shaped mound in Amino-cho, Kyotango City(former Amino-cho, Takeno-gun), Kyoto Prefecture. It is a gigantic tumulus with the total length of 200 m. It is counted among the three great tumuli along the coastline of the Sea of Japan, together with the Shinmeiyama-kofun Tumulus and the Ebisuyama-kofun Tumulus. It is the largest of them. It is designated as a national historical site. </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>The tumulus seems to have been built between the end of the early Kofun (Tumulus) period and the beginning of the mid-Kofun period (between the late fourth century and the early fifth century). </p>
<p>The tumulus is accompanied by two baizuka (smaller tumuli) of the Tumulus of Cloistered Emperor Kanpyo and the Kochoshi-kofun Tumulus, both of which are specified as national historical sites. <h3>Research</h3>
</p>
<p>In 1918 Sueji UMEHARA carried out research on the tumulus, which was designated as a national historical site based on his findings. </p>
<p>Conducted for the purpose of rice paddy development in 1986, the excavation discovered a surrounding moat in the south-eastern part of the mound. </p>
