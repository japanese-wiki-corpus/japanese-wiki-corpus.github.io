<h1>Fujii Daimaru (a department store in Kyoto City) (藤井大丸)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Fujii Daimaru Co., Ltd. is a department store in Kyoto City of Japan. The store is located at Teramachi Street, Shijo Street, Shimogyo Ward, Kyoto City, and is a long-established store founded in 1912. It is very popular among the local citizens as a local department store in Kyoto City. </p>
<p>It positions itself apart from competing stores by limiting lines of business. It keeps a lot of specialty boutiques and the like such as UNITED ARROWS and JOURNAL STANDARD which are popular among young people. </p>
<p>It has no connection in either capital or human resources with a major department store Daimaru (the head office is in Osaka City) which is running Kyoto-mise (Kyoto Branch) at Shijotakakura-dori Street (about 400 meters to the west of Fujii Daimaru), nor with a stationery wholesale trading company Daimaru Fujii in Sapporo City. </p>
