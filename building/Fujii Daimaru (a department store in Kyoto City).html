<h1>Fujii Daimaru (a department store in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>) (藤井大丸)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Fujii Daimaru Co., Ltd. is a department store in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a> of Japan. The store is located at Teramachi Street, Shijo Street, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Shimogyo Ward.html">Shimogyo Ward</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>, and is a long-established store founded in 1912. It is very popular among the local citizens as a local department store in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>. </p>
<p>It positions itself <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Apart (Apartment).html">apart</a> from competing stores by limiting lines of business. It keeps a lot of specialty boutiques and the like such as UNITED ARROWS and JOURNAL STANDARD which are popular among young people. </p>
<p>It has no connection in either capital or human resources with a major department store Daimaru (the head office is in Osaka City) which is running Kyoto-mise (Kyoto Branch) at Shijotakakura-dori Street (about 400 meters to the west of Fujii Daimaru), nor with a stationery wholesale trading company Daimaru Fujii in Sapporo City. </p>
