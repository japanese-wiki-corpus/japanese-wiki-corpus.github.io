<h1>Tanabe-jo Castle (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Tango Province.html">Tango Province</a>) (田辺城 (丹後国))</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Tanabe-jo Castle, located in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Maizuru City.html">Maizuru City</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>, was build between <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Sengoku Period (period of warring states) (Japan).html">Sengoku Period</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Edo Period.html">Edo Period</a>. It is also known as Maizuru-jo Castle. </p>
<p><h3>The <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Sengoku Period (period of warring states) (Japan).html">Sengoku Period</a></h3>
</p>
<p>In 1578, Fujitaka HOSOKAWA, as instructed by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Nobunaga ODA.html">Nobunaga ODA</a>, conquered <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Tango Province.html">Tango Province</a> by destroying <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">Daimyo</a> (Guardian Feudal Lord) <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshimichi ISSHIKI.html">Yoshimichi ISSHIKI</a>; thus being allowed to control the area, Fujitaka first settled in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Miyazu-jo Castle.html">Miyazu-jo Castle</a> but later built Tanabe-jo Castle in Tanabe, Kasa Gun, which was strategically important for transportation and close to Kinai, in order to make it the center for governing the area of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Tango Province.html">Tango Province</a>. His son, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Tadaoki HOSOKAWA.html">Tadaoki HOSOKAWA</a>, inherited the castle when Fujitaka retired. <h3>The Siege of Tanabe-jo Castle</h3>
</p>
<p>In 1600, when the Battle of Sekigahara broke out, as the head of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/family/Hosokawa clan.html">Hosokawa clan</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Tadaoki HOSOKAWA.html">Tadaoki HOSOKAWA</a> declined the invitation of Sei-Gun (western camp, led by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Mitsunari ISHIDA.html">Mitsunari ISHIDA</a>) to join them, and instead his army sided with To-Gun (eastern camp), which was headed by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Ieyasu TOKUGAWA.html">Ieyasu TOKUGAWA</a>. </p>
<p>Fujitaka had retired at <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Miyazu-jo Castle.html">Miyazu-jo Castle</a> but now judged that the castle was too fragile to defend against a Sei-Gun attack and therefore set it ablaze, and his army entered Tanabe-jo Castle to counter the armies of Sei-Gun, which were advancing like a fog to encircle the castle. The battle continued for as long as 50 days after Tanabe-jo Castle was quickly besieged by a force of 15,000 soldiers of Sei-Gun, whose leaders included <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Shigekatsu ONOGI.html">Shigekatsu ONOGI</a>, a relative of Kiyoki SHIMA, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Mitsunari ISHIDA.html">Mitsunari ISHIDA</a>'s chief retainer, and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Shigekatsu MAEDA.html">Shigekatsu MAEDA</a>, who was the son of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Geni MAEDA.html">Geni MAEDA</a>, an important retainer of the Toyotomi family. Fujitaka, running out of ammunition after a fierce battle, worried that his "Kokindenju no Sho" might be damaged and lost in the war, so he offered it to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Goyozei.html">Emperor Goyozei</a>. Fujitaka survived because Sei-Gun eventually stopped its attack thanks to the intervention of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Goyozei.html">Emperor Goyozei</a>, who worried about Fujitaka's imminent death in the battle. Fujitaka surrendered Tanabe-jo Castle and instead settled in Tanba-Kameyama-jo Castle in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Tanba (train).html">Tanba</a>, which was owned by the enemy general, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Shigekatsu MAEDA.html">Shigekatsu MAEDA</a>. <h3>The <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Edo Period.html">Edo Period</a></h3>
</p>
<p>After this, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Tadaoki HOSOKAWA.html">Tadaoki HOSOKAWA</a> was transferred to Kokura, in Kyushu, and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Takatomo KYOGOKU.html">Takatomo KYOGOKU</a> temporarily entered Tanabe-jo Castle with 123,000 koku to govern <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Tango Province.html">Tango Province</a>, but later he rebuilt <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Miyazu-jo Castle.html">Miyazu-jo Castle</a> in order to establish a base there. Reportedly, on this occasion all the buildings of Tanabe-jo Castle were destroyed (Ikkoku Ichijyo Rei). According to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Takatomo KYOGOKU.html">Takatomo KYOGOKU</a>'s will, among the Kyogoku family members his eldest son Takahiro inherited the Miyazu domain with 70,000 koku, the second son Takamitsu inherited the Tango-Tanabe domain (Maizuru domain) with 35,000 koku, and the adopted son Takanobu inherited the Mineyama domain with 13,000 koku. </p>
<p><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Takamitsu KYOGOKU.html">Takamitsu KYOGOKU</a>, the first lord of the Maizuru domain, reconstructed Tanabe-jo Castle from the devastation, renovating its stone walls and rebuilding the watchtowers. </p>
<p>The Kyogoku clan, having been transferred to the Toyooka domain after three generations, was in 1668 replaced by the Makino clan with 35,000 koku; the clan rebuilt the main gate, other gates and stone walls of Tanabe-jo Castle, and as part of its heritage continued the engineering work and prosperity for generations till the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period. <h3>The Tanabe-jo Castle of Today</h3>
</p>
<p>The compound of former Tanabe-jo Castle is now a garden surrounding the Shouko Kan (two-level tower), which was rebuilt in 1940, Tanabe-jo Castle Museum in the castle gate (rebuilt in 1997) and the stone mound foundation for <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Tenshu.html">tenshu</a> (main keep). <h3>Access</h3>
