<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>This museum was opened in 1984 with a collection of the second Tokushichi NOMURA (1878 - 1945), who founded Nomura Securities Co.,Ltd. and other companies, as major exhibits. Although being a businessman, the second Tokushichi was also a chajin (master of the tea ceremony) named 'Tokuan,' and learned the tea ceremony under Setsuan YABUNOUCHI and the Noh play under <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Sakon KANZE.html">Sakon KANZE</a>. Since Tokuan had great knowledge of the tea ceremony and Noh play, the items in the collection are centered on the two themes. </p>
