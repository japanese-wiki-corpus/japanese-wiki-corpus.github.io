<h1>Kyoto Nishikyogoku Athletic Park Supplementary Field (京都市西京極総合運動公園補助競技場)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kyoto Nishikyogoku Athletic Park Supplementary Field is a subfield of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Kyoto Nishikyogoku Athletic Stadium.html">Kyoto Nishikyogoku Athletic Stadium</a> in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Ukyo Ward.html">Ukyo Ward</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>, and is owned and managed by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>. </p>
<p>The supplementary field, as well as the main stadium, was on the official candidate list for the 2002 FIFA World Cup training camps. Front-row seats are arranged on almost the same level as the field and there is no fence between the seats and the field. Seats are not angled, nor are they elevated, so the supplementary field may not be an ideal place to watch the games. The Nishikyogoku Comprehensive Sports Park also includes Nishikyogoku Baseball Stadium where professional baseball teams play their official games. </p>
