<p>The Umami-kofun Tumuli Cluster was constructed around the Umami-kyuryo Hill which was stretched from Kawai Town, Koryo Town of Kitakatsuragi County to Yamato Takada City, Nara Prefecture, in the southwest area of the Nara Basin. It was one of the most famous tumuli clusters in Nara Prefecture, consisting of three groups: North group, Middle group and South group. </p>

In the mid-early period to the middle period, tumuli of more than 200 meters long were constructed. </p>
