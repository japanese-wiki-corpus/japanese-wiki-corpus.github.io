<h1>Shuden-zukuri style (主殿造)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Shuden-zukuri style is the term proposed in architectural history for indicating the architectural style of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> residences during the Muromachi period. </p>
<p>Initially, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> residences followed the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Shinden-zukuri.html">Shinden-zukuri</a> style, and the layout of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshinori ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshinori ASHIKAGA</a>'s residence (Hana no Gosho (literally, Flower Palace)) is centered on a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shinden.html">shinden</a> (main house). However, by the time of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshimasa ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshimasa ASHIKAGA</a>'s Higashiyama-dono, a Tsune no gosho (a building for living) called the Shuden was created. The Shuden was a place where all daily activities could be done with a room for conducting taimen (meeting to confirm the relations between lord and retainer) and Buddhist services and bedroom. </p>
<p>This architectural style is different from that of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Shinden-zukuri.html">Shinden-zukuri</a> style, where a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shinden.html">shinden</a> and Tainoya (the building where family members of the residence lived) were connected with a corridor, and the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Shoin-zukuri.html">Shoin-zukuri</a> style where an entrance, a dai-shoin (a large drawing room) and a sho-shoin (a small drawing room) were connected in a row. It is considered as a distinct architectural style and called the Shuden-zukuri style. </p>

</p>
<p>No buildings of the Shuden-zukuri style have survived from that time and its characteristics can only be surmised from existing related documents. Although built more recently, it is said that the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Shoin (the Tendai sect).html">shoin</a> (drawing room) at <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Onjo-ji Temple.html">Onjo-ji Temple</a> maintains some aspects of the Shuden-zukuri style. The floor, shelves and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Shoin (the Tendai sect).html">shoin</a> give an impression of an old-fashioned <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Shoin (the Tendai sect).html">shoin</a>. </p>
<p>The Reception Hall of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Kangakuin.html">Kangakuin</a> (built in 1600) and Reception Hall of Kojoin (built in 1601) at <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Onjo-ji Temple.html">Onjo-ji Temple</a> are <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/National Treasures (of Japan).html">National Treasures</a>. The <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Shoin (the Tendai sect).html">shoin</a> that was once in Nikko-in of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Onjo-ji Temple.html">Onjo-ji Temple</a> was dismantled and reconstructed in Tokyoto become the Gekko-den (literally, a moon light hall) at Gokoku-ji Temple (Important Cultural Property). </p>
