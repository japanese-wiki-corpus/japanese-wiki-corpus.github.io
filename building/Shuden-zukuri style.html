<h1>Shuden-zukuri style (主殿造)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Shuden-zukuri style is the term proposed in architectural history for indicating the architectural style of samurai residences during the Muromachi period. </p>
<p>Initially, samurai residences followed the Shinden-zukuri style, and the layout of the Shogun Yoshinori ASHIKAGA's residence (Hana no Gosho (literally, Flower Palace)) is centered on a shinden (main house). However, by the time of Yoshimasa ASHIKAGA's Higashiyama-dono, a Tsune no gosho (a building for living) called the Shuden was created. The Shuden was a place where all daily activities could be done with a room for conducting taimen (meeting to confirm the relations between lord and retainer) and Buddhist services and bedroom. </p>
<p>This architectural style is different from that of the Shinden-zukuri style, where a shinden and Tainoya (the building where family members of the residence lived) were connected with a corridor, and the Shoin-zukuri style where an entrance, a dai-shoin (a large drawing room) and a sho-shoin (a small drawing room) were connected in a row. It is considered as a distinct architectural style and called the Shuden-zukuri style. </p>

<p>No buildings of the Shuden-zukuri style have survived from that time and its characteristics can only be surmised from existing related documents. Although built more recently, it is said that the shoin (drawing room) at Onjo-ji Temple maintains some aspects of the Shuden-zukuri style. The floor, shelves and shoin give an impression of an old-fashioned shoin. </p>
<p>The Reception Hall of Kangakuin (built in 1600) and Reception Hall of Kojoin (built in 1601) at Onjo-ji Temple are National Treasures. The shoin that was once in Nikko-in of Onjo-ji Temple was dismantled and reconstructed in Tokyoto become the Gekko-den (literally, a moon light hall) at Gokoku-ji Temple (Important Cultural Property). </p>
