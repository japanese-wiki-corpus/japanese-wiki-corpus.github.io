<h1>Gongen-zukuri style (a term concerning architecture) (権現造)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The gongen-zukuri style is a style of shrine buildings in Japan. It is also called ishinoma-zukuri style "literally, stone-room style." </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>One characteristic of this style is that the honden (main hall) and haiden (hall of worship), usually two separate buildings, are integrated, and connected by a low building called "ishinoma." </p>
<p>It is said that the gongen-zukuri style started with Hiyoshi Tosho-gu Shrine (built in 1634) in Sakamoto, Otsu City. It is said that this style originated in Kaizan-do Hall adopted in Buddist temples, where the Shi-do hall (a hall dedicated to the souls of ancestors), is connected to the Rai-do hall (a worship hall) with the Ainoma (connection room). However, it is also said that the hall is based on the hachiman-zukuri style. <h3>Structure</h3>
</p>
<p>Three buildings each in the irimoya style (with a half-hipped roof) and which are hirairi (a style of building which has the entrance on its long side) are joined by a building in the irimoya style and which is tsumairi (a style of building which has the entrance on its short side) and is placed perpendicular to the three buildings. </p>
<p>Because a large number of ridges is used in this style, it is also called "yatsumune-zukuri style" (literally, eight-ridge style). However, in actual fact it only has seven ridges. </p>
<p>In the hachiman-zukuri style, both the front hall and back hall are the main halls. On the other hand, in the gongen-zukuri style, only the rear building is the main hall, and it can be said that the haiden, ishinoma and honden constitute a form of composite shrine building. <h3>The roofs</h3>
</p>
<p>Many materials are used for making the roofs, including not only thatch but tiles and other materials. </p>
<p>The hafu (bargeboard) on the front side is either a chidori hafu or a noki kara hafu (both are hafu with a kind of decoration). </p>
<p>The pillars<br/>
</p>
<p>Gongen-zukuri style buildings are horizontally symmetrical, with an even number of pillars on either side. </p>
<p>The haiden is the widest of the three, and the ishinoma and the honden are of different widths. </p>
<p>At Kitano Tenman-gu Shrine the haiden is 23.4 meters wide, the ishinoma 12.6 meters wide and the honden 9 meters wide. At Nikko Tosho-gu Shrine the haiden is 16.2 meters wide, the ishinoma 5.4 meters wide and the honden 9 meters wide. The honden of Kitano Tenman-gu Shrine is not symmetrical horizontally, because it has a wakiden (hall standing nearby the main hall) to its left. </p>
<p>The floors<br/>
</p>
<p>The floor of the ishinoma was laid with stones in buildings of ancient styles, as in KitanoTenman-gu Shrine, but are otherwise mostly made of boards. In Nikko Tosho-gu Shrine, the floor of the ishinoma is made of tatami mats. </p>
