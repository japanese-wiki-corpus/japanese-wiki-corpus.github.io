<h1>Kitaoji Bus Terminal (北大路バスターミナル)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Located in Kita-ku Ward of Kyoto City, Kitaoji Bus Terminal is a bus terminal of Kyoto City Bus. Adjacent to Kitaoji Station of Kyoto City Subway Karasuma Line, it is in the basement of Kitaoji Town jointly with Kyoto City Bus Karasuma Office. </p>
<p>Location<br/>
It is at the northwest corner of Kitaoji-dori Street and Karasuma-dori Street (precisely, a block to the west), and it has been the landmark of Kitaoji-dori Street since it was Karasuma Shako (carbarn) of Kyoto City Trams. 
<br/>Although this district should be called 'Karasuma Kitaoji' as a neighborhood name is usually made by connecting a north-south street name and an east-west street name in Kyoto, this name is rarely used, but it is called 'Kitaoji Bus Terminal,' or 'Kitaoji Station.'<br/>
Karasuma Shako' still used by the older generation. </p>
<p>Its building above ground used to be a carbarn for the City Streetcars, and was later turned into the Karasuma City Bus Office, then into City Subway Karasuma Line Kitaoji Station (it had also housed an inspection facility for subway cars until Takeda Station was extended), but now large-scale commercial facilities have been built there in order to effectively utilize the old carbarn site as one of the management reforms. They are operated by Kitaoji Town, a third-sector company, and VIVRE (Kitaoji VIVRE) and Konami Sports & Life are among the tenants. </p>
<p>History<br/>
May 1981: The bus terminal was set up in the site of Kyoto City Bus Karasuma Office when Kyoto City Subway Karasuma Line started service. 1994: It was moved to the basement of Kitaoji Town under the redevelopment of the City Bus Office site with the aim of effective utilization of Kyoto Transportation Bureau's properties. </p>
<p>Facilities<br/>
Since it stands at the north side of Kitaoji-dori Street, buses enter to the second basement using a slope way. Inside behind its entrance is 'Bus Oriba' (getting-off zone), at which buses managed by Karasuma Office stop, buses are emptied, drivers are changed, buses kill time, and sometimes operations of some routes are canceled here for the day. Buses under Kyoto City Bus Kujo Office and Nishigamo Office directly go to 'Noriba' (boarding zone) without stopping here. </p>
<p>From here buses turn around 180 degrees to reach 'Noriba' which has 'Aka Noriba' (literally, red boarding gates), A through D, and 'Ao Noriba' (literally, blue boarding gates), E through G, three gates each. The third basement connects these two kinds of gates. Aka Noriba' on the east is for the routes eastward through Kitaoji-dori Street, and 'Ao Noriba' on the west is for the routes westward. </p>
<p>On the third basement level are an access way, a commuter pass wicket, an information counter, Kyoto City certificates issuing corner, and a passage to the subway station. </p>
<p>This Karasuma Office houses a dispatcher room, a drivers' waiting room adjacent to Oriba, a garage behind the bus route and at the north side, and part of it is above ground. </p>
<p>Routes<br/>
All are Kyoto City Bus routes. </p>
<p>Kyoto Bus has a route that runs in front of this Bus Terminal, but it dose not use the terminal now (described later). </p>
<p>Only these two bus companies have operating routes in this district. </p>
<p>Long-distance coaches do not run through this district. </p>
