<h1>Hebizuka-kofun Tumulus (蛇塚古墳)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Hebizuka-kofun Tumulus is a tumulus located in Uzumasa, Ukyo Ward, Kyoto City, Kyoto Prefecture. </p>
<p>It is a large keyhole-shaped mound with the largest horizontal stone chamber in Kyoto Prefecture. It was designated as a national historical site (on May 4, 1977). </p>
<p><h3>Access</h3>
</p>
<p>Approximately seven-minute walk south of Katabiranotsuji Station, the Keifuku Electric Railroad. </p>
<p>Located in the middle of a residential area, the tumulus is not so easy to find. <h3>Others</h3>
</p>
<p>The origin of the name, "Hebizuka" (snake hill) is sometimes explained that snakes used to live in the stone chamber. Before the surrounding area turned into a residential district, the stone chamber towered high in an empty space. It was easily accessible. 
<br/>It was once called 'iwaya.'<br/>
The Hebizuka-kofun Tumulus is often compared to the Ishibutai-kofun Tumulus in terms of the size of its stone chamber. The stone chamber of Ishibutai-kofun Tumulus is made of granite whereas the Hebizuka-kofun Tumulus is made of sedimentary rock. The ceiling stone of the Hebizuka-kofun Tumulus has been lost. </p>
<p>In the north-east of the tumulus, there used to be a studio named 'Hebizuka (Omokage) Film Studio,' (the Uzumasa Studio of Arashi Kanjuro Production, which later became a part of the open set of Daiei Film Company). <h3>Tumuli in Sagano</h3>
</p>
<p>There were many tumuli such as the Hebizuka-kofun Tumulus in Sagano, but most have disappeared due to urban development. The extant tumuli are as follows. <h3>Amazuka-kofun Tumulus (national historical site)</h3>
</p>
<p>The Amazuka-kofun Tumulus is a keyhole-shaped mound with the total length of 71 m, built in the late Kofun period,<br/>
It consists of two horizontal stone chambers of which one is 10 m long and the other is 7.5 m long. <h3>Chiyonomichi-kofun Tumulus</h3>
</p>
<p>The Chiyonomichi-kofun Tumulus is a round barrow with the diameter of 16 m, built in the late Kofun period. It has a horizontal stone chamber. <h3>Narabigaoka Burial Mounds</h3>
</p>
<p>Situated in Narabigaoka (scenic beauty), the Narabigaoka Burial Mounds is a tumulus complex with 20 burial mounds built during the mid Kofun period. Burial Mound No. 1 (Ichinooka-kofun Tumulus) in particular is a round barrow with the diameter of 44 m. It has a horizontal chamber made of a stone as gigantic as the one in the Hebizuka-kofun Tumulus. <h3>Daikaku-ji Burial Mounds</h3>
</p>
<p>These burial mounds were constructed during the late Kofun period. Of the four extant tumuli Burial Mound No. 1 (Maruyama-kofun Tumulus) and Burial Mound No. 2 (Nyudotsuka-kofun Tumulus) are designated as referable mausoleums. <h3>Tarumiyama-kofun Tumulus (Katahiraotsuka-kofun Tumulus and the Takabatake Mausoleum of Imperial Prince Nakano)</h3>
</p>
<p>Located 500 m north of the Hebizuka-kofun Tumulus, the Tumulus is a large keyhole-shaped mound with a length of 75 m. Like the Hebizuka-kofun Tumulus, it is ascribed to the late Kofun period though it seems to have been constructed during the mid sixth century. Being well-preserved, it is currently managed by the Imperial Household Agency. </p>
