<h1>Akanabe-no-sho Manor (茜部荘)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Akanabe-no-sho Manor was a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> (manor in medieval Japan) that existed in Mino Province during the Heian and Muromachi Periods. It was originally called Atsumi-no-sho. It was an estate of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Todai-ji Temple.html">Todai-ji Temple</a>. </p>
<p><h3>Location</h3>
</p>
<p>The southern part of Atsumi Country, Mino Province. Its center corresponds to today's Akanabe area （Akanabe-ono, Akanabe-nakashima, Akanabe-hishino, Akanabe-shinsho, Akanabe-terayashiki, etc.) in Gifu City, Gifu Prefecture. <h3>Size</h3>
</p>
<p>About 111.71ha, as of the year 818. </p>
<p>Origin<br/>
</p>
<p>It was originally a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Chokushiden.html">chokushiden</a> (imperial proprietorships and land) of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Kammu.html">Emperor Kammu</a>, and was established as a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> on March 14, 809. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Kammu.html">Emperor Kammu</a> transferred it to his daughter, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Imperial Princess Asahara.html">Imperial Princess Asahara</a>, and on May 9, 818, the land was donated to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Todai-ji Temple.html">Todai-ji Temple</a> by her mother, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Imperial Princess Sakahito.html">Imperial Princess Sakahito</a>, according to her will. </p>
<p>It is said that after the manor became the territory of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Todai-ji Temple.html">Todai-ji Temple</a>, Akanabe-jinja Shrine (listed in the Jinmyocho (list of deities) of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Engishiki.html">Engishiki</a> (codes and procedures on national rites and prayers)) was founded in the year 830 by the ceremonial transfer of the divided tutelary deity of Usa Hachiman-gu Shrine. </p>
<p>In 960, the manor's name was changed from Atsumi-no-sho to Akanabe-no-sho. <h3>Feudal Lord</h3>

<h3>Demise</h3>
</p>
<p>Since the time when <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/OE no Hiromoto.html">OE no Hiromoto</a>'s son, Tokihiro NAGAI, became jito (manager and lord of a manor) during the Kamakura Period, the Nagai family had handed down the post down through successive generations and gradually expanded its control over the manor through repeated legal action against <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Todai-ji Temple.html">Todai-ji Temple</a>, but Emperor Godaigo confiscated the manor during the period of the Northern and Southern Courts and redonated it to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Todai-ji Temple.html">Todai-ji Temple</a>. The details of the successive jito who served since this time are unknown, but the manor had become completely outside of the control of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Todai-ji Temple.html">Todai-ji Temple</a> by the time of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Onin War.html">Onin War</a>. <h3>Note</h3>
</p>
<p>The <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Nengu (Land Tax).html">nengu</a> (land tax) was collected in the form of silk and cotton to cover the clothing costs of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Todai-ji Temple.html">Todai-ji Temple</a>. </p>
