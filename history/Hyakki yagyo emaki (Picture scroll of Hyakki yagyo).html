<h1>Hyakki yagyo emaki (Picture scroll of Hyakki yagyo) (百鬼夜行絵巻)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Hyakki yagyo emaki is a type of Japanese picture scrolls. The most famous one is 'Hyakki yagyozu' (important cultural property, Shinjuan-bon) owned by Shinjuan, one of sub-temple located in the site of Daikoku-ji Temple in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a> and is associated with Ikkyu Sojun. </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>As seen from its name, Hyakki yagyo emaki is a collective name of picture scrolls where the appearance of 'Hyakki yagyo' (Night <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Parade.html">Parade</a> of One Hundred Demons) is drawn. Provided, however, that this name was created by contemporary researchers and was not originally in use. Therefore, even though similar pictures are drawn, some picture scrolls are called '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Yokai (specter).html">Yokai</a> emaki' (picture scroll of specter) if they are not confirmed as the appearance of Hyakki yagyo. </p>
<p>Though these types of picture scrolls are owned by many institutions around the world, the most famous one is Shinjuan-bon. It has been known to be drawn by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Mitsunobu TOSA.html">Mitsunobu TOSA</a> during the Muromachi period. Specter of a variety of things called Tsukumo-gami are drawn in this picture scroll. </p>
<p>While Tsukumo-gami is drawn in Shinjuan-bon, specter of animals is also drawn in other picture scrolls. Therefore, it is considered that several kinds of picture scrolls originally existed and these have been passed down after being copied. <h3><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>: A work owned by Shinju-an subtemple of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Daitoku-ji Temple.html">Daitoku-ji Temple</a></h3>
