<h1>Jigeuke (地下請)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Jigeuke was a system in which village communities of medieval Japan undertook the task of feudal lords to collect <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Nengu (Land Tax).html">nengu</a> (land tax) to be paid to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> (manor in medieval Japan) or <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kokugaryo.html">Kokugaryo</a> (territories governed by provincial government office). The jigeuke is also called <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Soson (a community comprising a self-governing association of peasants).html">soson</a> uke or <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Hyakusho.html">hyakusho</a> uke. </p>
<p>In <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> koryo sei (The System of Public Lands and Private Estates) of Japan, the feudal lords originally had the right to collect the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Nengu (Land Tax).html">nengu</a>. </p>
<p>However, after entering into the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period, as jito (manager and lord of manor) extended their control over the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> and koryo (an Imperial demesne), jitouke, which awarded the local jito (or the deputy) the contract to collect the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Nengu (Land Tax).html">nengu</a>, came to be put into practice. Under the jitouke, the jito was responsible for paying the feudal lord a certain amount of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Nengu (Land Tax).html">nengu</a> regardless of the yield. </p>
<p>With this background, beginning in the period of the Northern and Southern Courts (Japan), <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Soson (a community comprising a self-governing association of peasants).html">soson</a> (a community consisting of peasants' self-governing association) was formed by the peasants who had developed their autonomy and sense of solidarity. </p>
<p>As a result of negotiation with the feudal lords, the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Soson (a community comprising a self-governing association of peasants).html">soson</a> also came to acquire the contract which gave them the right to collect <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Nengu (Land Tax).html">nengu</a> themselves. This was called jigeuke. </p>
<p>The <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Soson (a community comprising a self-governing association of peasants).html">soson</a> practicing the jigeuke was paying a certain amount of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Nengu (Land Tax).html">nengu</a> to the feudal lord every year. From the viewpoint of the feudal lords, the jigeuke had much greater advantages than collecting <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Nengu (Land Tax).html">nengu</a> by themselves because it enabled them to avoid the risk of a poor harvest as well as to reduce the cost of collecting the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Nengu (Land Tax).html">nengu</a>. The implementation of jigeuke indicates that the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Soson (a community comprising a self-governing association of peasants).html">soson</a> gained the trust of the ruling class although it consisted of people under the rule of such class. To prove worthy of such trust, the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Soson (a community comprising a self-governing association of peasants).html">soson</a> tried to ensure the execution of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Nengu (Land Tax).html">nengu</a> payment. For example, it assigned a quota of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Nengu (Land Tax).html">nengu</a> to each so villager and enacted <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/So-okite.html">so-okite</a> (rules), which established penalties (such as the confiscation of property) to be imposed on any member who failed to meet the required quota. </p>
<p>The jigeuke continued from the Muromachi period through the Azuchi-Momoyama period, and was succeeded by the murauke system (village-wide, collective responsibility for tax payment) in the Edo period. </p>
