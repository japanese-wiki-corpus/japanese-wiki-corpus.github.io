<p></p>
<p>Karafuto Agency (Karafuto-Cho) was a regional administrative agency, which controlled Karafuto under Japanese possession. </p>
<p>In this case Karafuto means the region and attached islands south of the fifty northern latitude on Sakhalin (so-called Southern Sakhalin), which was incorporated into Japan through the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Treaty of Portsmouth.html">Treaty of Portsmouth</a>. </p>
<p>Due to the Proclamation of the Imperial Ordinance no.33, 1907 on March 15, 1907 Karafuto's Government's system of administration was officially established on April 1, 1907. In this way the Karafuto Civil Office (Karafuto Minseisho), which was the administrative body up to then, was dissolved and absorbed into the new administration. The government building was first located in Otomari Town and then moved to Toyohara City on August 13, 1908. </p>
<p>According to the Proclamation in 1920, Imperial Ordinance no.124, 1920 (regarding exceptions in law which is enforced on Karafuto), Karafuto-Cho became part of the so-called outer territories (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Gaichi.html">gaichi</a>), later, in 1942 it fell under the jurisdiction of the Home Ministry (Japan) and the municipal law of Japan came to be applied. In this way Karafuto was incorporated into the so-called Japan proper (naichi). </p>
<p>After the Soviet Declaration of War on Japan in August 1945, Soviet troops invaded the district of Karafuto-Cho and by the end of the month all of Karafuto was occupied. Karafuto-Cho as a government agency was transferred to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs jurisdiction and was then abolished in June 1, 1949 under the National Government Organization Act (See "Nihon Tochika no Karafuto" [Sakhalin under Japanese rule] <Gaichi Hoseishi>, Gaimusho Joyakukyoku Hokika [Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Treaty Bureau, Regulation Section]; 1969). </p>
