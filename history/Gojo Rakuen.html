<h1>Gojo Rakuen (五条楽園)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Gojo Rakuen is an old yukaku (a red-light district) site located in the south-east area of Kawaramachi-dori and Gojo-dori Streets in Shimogyo Ward, Kyoto City. Gojo Rakuen (五条楽園) is also written as 五條楽園. </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>Gojo Rakuen had establishments called ochaya (literally "teahouse" which refers to places where geisha entertain their guests) that have a structure similar to a Japanese inn. Unlike machiai-jaya (tea houses, establishments that rented rooms in which visitors and geisha could amuse themselves) in Hanamachi (geisha districts in Kyoto), they offered adult entertainment. </p>
<p>Gojo Rakuen originated as two separate yukaku called Gojo-hashishita and Nanajo-shinchi located next to each other, but the two merged during the Taisho period and became Gojo Rakuen. </p>
