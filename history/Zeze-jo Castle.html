<p>Zeze-jo Castle used to stand in present Honmaru-cho, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Otsu City.html">Otsu City</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Shiga Prefecture.html">Shiga Prefecture</a>. </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>Zeze-jo Castle was located to the east of the downtown area of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Otsu City.html">Otsu City</a>. It was a mizu-shiro (castles on lakes or marshes for defensive reasons) built on Zezezaki, the land that protruded into <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Lake Biwa.html">Lake Biwa</a> near the mouth of Sagami-gawa River. Zeze-jo Castle is included in a list of the three typical castles in Japan and one of the ukishiros (castles built over and into the water) of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Lake Biwa.html">Lake Biwa</a> along with <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Otsu-jo Castle.html">Otsu-jo Castle</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Sakamoto-jo Castle.html">Sakamoto-jo Castle</a>, and Seta-jo Castle. While the Sannomaru (outer part of the castle) was situated inland, the Ninomaru (second bailey), the Kita-no-maru (north compartment of the castle), and the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Honmaru.html">Honmaru</a> (the keep of a castle) were built over and into the water. Its layout was in the Teikaku style. The <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Honmaru.html">Honmaru</a> held a four-story keep. 
<br/>A popular song among local people applauded its reflection in the water saying, 'While Seta no Karahashi Bridge is adorned with karagane-giboshi (bronze ornamental railing top), the water is adorned with the reflection of Zeze-jo Castle.'<br/>
<h3>Recent times</h3>
</p>
<p>In 1600, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Ieyasu TOKUGAWA.html">Ieyasu TOKUGAWA</a> won the Battle of Sekigahara and succeeded in becoming a ruler both in name and reality. The following year, in 1601, he had <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Otsu-jo Castle.html">Otsu-jo Castle</a> demolished and another castle built in Zezezaki to hold control over the Tokai-do Road. Zeze-jo Castle was the first castle built by Tenkabushin, a construction order given to territorial lords by the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Edo bakufu.html">Edo bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>). Edo-jo Castle, Osaka-jo Castle, Nagoya-jo Castle, and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Fukuchiyama-jo Castle.html">Fukuchiyama-jo Castle</a> were also built by Tenkabushin. Nawabari (general term for the layout of a castle and its component structures) was made by Takatora TODO who was known as a master of castle construction. He had a stone wall built in the lake and a four-story <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Tenshu.html">tenshu</a> erected in the eastern corner of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Honmaru.html">Honmaru</a>. It is said that Ieyasu chose this place for its proximity to Seta no Karahashi Bridge. 
<br/>Since the olden days, it had been said that 'person who has control over Seta no Karahashi Bridge can rule the country.'<br/>
</p>
<p>In the year it was built, Kazuaki TODA, the lord of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Otsu-jo Castle.html">Otsu-jo Castle</a>, was allowed to settle in it and have a territory worth 30,000 koku crop yields, which marked the establishment of the Zeze Domain. After that, it became a castle of fudai <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> (a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> in hereditary vassal to the Tokugawa family). In 1617, his son, Ujikane TODA, was ordered to change the territory to the Amagasaki Domain in Settsu Province. </p>
<p>Yasutoshi HONDA moved from the Nishio Domain in Mikawa Province to take his place. In 1621, his son, Toshitsugu, was ordered to change the territory again to the Nishio Domain. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Sadayoshi SUGANUMA.html">Sadayoshi SUGANUMA</a> moved from the Nagashima Domain in Ise Province to take his place. In 1634, he moved to the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/family/Tanba-Kameyama Domain.html">Tanba-Kameyama Domain</a> in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Tanba Province.html">Tanba Province</a>. Tadafusa ISHIKAWA moved from the Sakura Domain in Shimosa Province. In 1651, his son Noriyuki ISHIKAWA was ordered to change the territory to the Ise-Kameyama Domain in Ise Province. </p>
<p>After the Ishikawa clan, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Toshitsugu HONDA.html">Toshitsugu HONDA</a> again moved in from the Nishio Domain and was allowed to have a territory worth 70,000 koku crop yields. The Honda clan resided in it over 13 reigns or 220 years until the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Meiji Restoration (Meiji-ishin).html">Meiji Restoration</a>. </p>
<p>In 1662, the architecture was destroyed by an earthquake. This forced Toshitsugu to renovate the castle on a large scale. </p>
<p>Since Zeze-jo Castle was built on the lakeside, it later suffered water erosion consistently. So the renovation of the castle was constantly required, which put a heavy burden on the clan's finances. <h3>After the Edo period and the modern age</h3>
</p>
<p>In 1870, on the day after the Dajokan Fukoku (Decrees of the Cabinet) which ordered demolition of castles, the feudal retainers of the domain who wanted a quick change of government tore down the castle, including the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Tenshu.html">tenshu</a>. </p>
<p>At present, the place where the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Honmaru.html">Honmaru</a> stood is accessible by land. This place was developed into Zeze Park (Zeze-jo Castle Ruins). There are some remains of the stone wall and an imitation gate. The castle gates are now situated in Zeze-jinja Shrine, Shinozu-jinja Shrine, and Muchisaki-jinja Shrine, all of which are designated national important cultural assets. The <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Korai-mon Gate.html">Korai-mon Gate</a> was moved to land in Matsunohama, Izumiotsu City, Osaka Prefecture, property owned by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Hosomi Museum.html">Hosomi Museum</a>. The hommaru sumi <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Yagura (Turret).html">yagura</a> (corner towers of castle keep) were moved to and still stand in Basho kaikan (the place where <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Haiku.html">haiku</a> poet Basho visited) in the city. But, because of thorough remodeling, it is completely different from the original structure. </p>
<p>In 2006, the guard house for the Setaguchi main gate which was moved to private property was demolished. And the site of Ninomaru is now used for the Zeze water purifying plant. </p>
