<h1>Gekokujo (下克上)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Gekokujo ("the low overturning the high," a term used to describe retainers overthrowing their lords) describes situations in Japanese history that occur when a person of lower rank overthrows a superior either politically or militarily, and then supplants the superior's position in society. </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>As a term, gekokujo was in use from the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period through to the period of the Northern and Southern Courts (Japan); examples of gekokujo include the scoundrels that started to appear near the end of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period who fought against the authorities in order to protect their own vested interests, as well as the anti-authoritarian social movement known as "<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Basara.html">basara</a>" ("vajra" in Sanskrit) that occurred during the Nanbokucho period. <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Basara.html">Basara</a> activities were banned in the Kenmu Code, which was the fundamental code of laws for the shogunate established by <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Takauji ASHIKAGA.html">Takauji ASHIKAGA</a> in 1336. </p>
<p>The term also appeared in the phrase "Those who establish themselves by gekokujo (overthrowing their lords)" in the book "Scrawlings from the Nijo gawara," coming to be used as a symbol of the social tendencies of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Sengoku Period (period of warring states) (Japan).html">Sengoku Period</a> (Period of Warring States) in Japan. When we look back on historic situations where a lower-ranked group usurped the authority of their superiors, as when the aristocracy was overthrown by the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> class, the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> by the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Kanrei.html">Kanrei</a> (shogunal deputy), and the Protectors (essentially provincial governors) by their deputy Protectors, we label it "gekokujo," but for people in fact in the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Sengoku Period (period of warring states) (Japan).html">Sengoku Period</a>, such situations were more or less par for the course. Furthermore, cases where members of a given family usurped the position of head of the family and made themselves <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> (territorial lords) are too numerous to count; examples include Tadayoshi SHIMAZU, Harumasa NANBU, and Yoshitaka SATOMI. </p>
<p>One <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Point (Sentoki).html">point</a> of view holds that the custom of shukun oshikome (shutting away/neutralizing one's lord) often seen among the warrior society in the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period is another type of gekokujo. In the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> society of the medieval period, the existence and position of a lord was not necessarily guaranteed or absolute to his retainers; instead, lords and their group of retainers had a shared fate, and their relationship was one of mutual cooperation. As a result, those lords who ignored the desires and ideas of their retainers were often driven from power and replaced by someone else via a meeting of the retainers, and occasionally a powerful retainer would install himself as the new lord with the support of the group of retainers. This sort of tendency is a striking feature of the Muromachi period; <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Yoshinori ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshinori ASHIKAGA</a> being assassinated by the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/family/Akamatsu clan.html">Akamatsu clan</a> (in the Kakitsu Revolt), Shogun Yoshiki ASHIKAGA being driven from power by <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Masamoto HOSOKAWA.html">Masamoto HOSOKAWA</a> and replaced (in the Meio Coup), and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Yoshiteru ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshiteru ASHIKAGA</a>'s assassination by <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Hisahide MATSUNAGA.html">Hisahide MATSUNAGA</a> can all be understood as examples of shukun oshikome (shutting away/ neutralizing their lords) against the Shogunal family. In addition to these examples, there were frequently cases, such as the Protector family of Kawachi Province and the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/family/Hosokawa clan.html">Hosokawa clan</a>, who held the position of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Kanrei.html">Kanrei</a>, where deputy Protectors (<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a>) drove their lords from power and replaced them; other cases of shukun oshikome include when Harukata SUE engineered the banishment and annihilation of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Yoshitaka OUCHI.html">Yoshitaka OUCHI</a>, and when <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Shingen TAKEDA.html">Shingen TAKEDA</a> brought about the exile of his own father, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Nobutora TAKEDA.html">Nobutora TAKEDA</a>. </p>
<p>In this way, the mainstream view on the central principle underlying the unstable political situation during the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Sengoku Period (period of warring states) (Japan).html">Sengoku Period</a> gradually shifted from thinking it was gekokujo to people simply taking power for themselves via shukun oshikome. The control that the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> in the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Sengoku Period (period of warring states) (Japan).html">Sengoku Period</a> extended over their territories was definitely not autocratic; instead, it was premised on the approval and inclinations of their group of retainers. When looked at from this viewpoint, it is possible to see the system by which <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> in the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Sengoku Period (period of warring states) (Japan).html">Sengoku Period</a> ruled their domains as having come into existence via cooperation and solidarity between the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> and their groups of retainers. The lords who ignored--or worse yet, despised--the will and inclination of their group of retainers were likely to experience the misery of being deposed and replaced, and judged a fitting target for gekokujo by society. Yet, starting from the establishment of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI.html">Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI</a>'s government, situations of shukun oshikome calmed down, and were not seen inside the Tokugawa family itself (which held the shogunate), but shukun oshikome remained comparatively frequent among the various <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a>. <h3>A list of famous examples of gekokujo</h3>
</p>
<p>In 1441, the sixth Ashikaga <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a>, Yoshinori, was assassinated by Mitsusuke AKAMATSU and his son during the Kakitsu Rebellion. </p>
<p>In 1493, the tenth Ashikaga <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a>, Yoshitane, was deposed by <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Masamoto HOSOKAWA.html">Masamoto HOSOKAWA</a> and allies and replaced by the eleventh Ashikaga <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a>, Yoshizumi, while Masamoto himself assumed de facto leadership of the shogunate. </p>
<p>In 1551, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Dosan SAITO.html">Dosan SAITO</a> drove his lord the Protector Yorinari TOKI into exile and he himself became lord of Mino Province. </p>
<p>In 1565, the thirteenth Ashikaga <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a>, Yoshiteru, was assassinated by <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Hisahide MATSUNAGA.html">Hisahide MATSUNAGA</a> and his allies. </p>
<p>In 1573, the fifteenth (and last) Ashikaga <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a>, Yoshiaki, was exiled from <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> after losing in a confrontation with Nobunada ODA. </p>
<p>In 1582, there was an Incident at Honnoji temple. During the incident, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Nobunaga ODA.html">Nobunaga ODA</a> was the victim of an insurrection by his vassal Mitsuhide Akechi. </p>
<p>So, in 1582, the vassals of the Oda family gathered at Kiyosu castle in Owari Province (modern-day Aichi Pref.), and began their meeting (the Kiyosu meeting) to determine the rightful successor to the slain <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Nobunaga ODA.html">Nobunaga ODA</a>. <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI.html">Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI</a>, who had the greatest record of achievements after hunting down and killing Mitsuhide AKECHI--the ringleader of the Incident at Honnoji temple--nominated <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Hidenobu ODA.html">Hidenobu ODA</a>, the grandson of Nobunaga, as a puppet ruler (Hidenobu was only two at the time), thereby usurping the lion's <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Share.html">share</a> of successional power for himself. </p>
