<p></p>
<p>The Kuraryo is an institution affiliated with the Ministry of Central Affairs of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Ritsuryo.html">Ritsuryo</a> system during the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Ritsuryo.html">Ritsuryo</a> system period of Japan. It is read 'Uchinokura no <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Tsukasa (a rank in government offices).html">tsukasa</a>' in Japanese. 
<br/>The Tang name is 'Kura-be.'<br/>
</p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>The origins of the Kuraryo can be traced to Uchikura, which is one of the Mitsunokura (Okura, Uchikura, and Imikura) that existed before the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Ritsuryo.html">Ritsuryo</a> system,<br/>
The Uchikura is thought to have existed around the period of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Richu.html">Emperor Richu</a> as a storage place to manage the Emperor's family's treasures and continued to exist as an institution within the Ministry of Central Affairs even after the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Ritsuryo.html">Ritsuryo</a> system started. </p>
<p>The official duties of the Kuraryo are accounting duties related to the Emperor's family such as managing the Emperor's family fortune which included gold, silver and silk sent by the Ministry of Finance for running the court, the keeping of treasures, grants to courtiers, and procurement. It also manufactured decorative items as a government-run craft center. Therefore, it was extremely important and continued under the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kurodo (Chamberlain).html">Kurodo</a> dokoro (the institution where the Imperial archives were kept) with a certain degree of importance even after the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Ritsuryo.html">Ritsuryo</a> system stooped functioning. Kuraryo had a large overlap with the Finance Ministry of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Ritsuryo.html">Ritsuryo</a> system, which did the accounting and the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Naishoryo (Bureau of Skilled Artisans).html">Naishoryo</a> (the institution where the furnishings and formality goods of the Imperial Family were made), which was the core of the government-run craft centers, and government-regulated organizations changed frequently. </p>
<p>As the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Ritsuryo.html">Ritsuryo</a> system declined and the court itself started to function as the institution to manage the Emperor's family's household, it became tradition for the position of Kuranokami (the chief of Kuraryo) to be filled by court officials of the fourth rank that had previously been Kurodonoto (the chief of Kurodo Dokoro) or worked in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Benkan (Collective name of posts in Daijokan).html">Benkan</a> (clerical section) or <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Konoefu (Headquarters of the Inner Palace Guards).html">Konoefu</a> (Imperial palace guards), and then in the period of governments by cloistered emperors became a position for prominent <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Zuryo (The Head of The Provincial Governors).html">Zuryo</a> (head of provincial government) with strong financial power, and in the early Muromachi period, the Yamashina family held the position together with the position, Mizushidokoro Betto (superintendent of the cooking section for the emperor), and it has been essentially their hereditary post ever since. </p>
<p>Although this position was abolished with the government system reforms that took place during the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Meiji Restoration (Meiji-ishin).html">Meiji Restoration</a>, in conforming with the plan by Hirofumi ITO to 'separate the court and government,' it was reinstated as an institution within the Imperial Household Ministry in 1884 and continued until the ministry was abolished in 1947. Currently, the Grand Steward's Secretariat (Treasurer of the Imperial Household, Accounting Division and Supply Division) is in charge of duties. </p>
<p>Kuranosuke (Deputy chief of Kuraryo) <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshio OISHI.html">Yoshio OISHI</a> means that Yoshio was a deputy in the Kuraryo. It goes without saying that he did not do have any duties as deputy, but as mentioned previously, the Kuraryo and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Naishoryo (Bureau of Skilled Artisans).html">Naishoryo</a>, where <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Naganori ASANO.html">Naganori ASANO</a> was head, have a close relationship regarding duties. <h3>Staff</h3>
