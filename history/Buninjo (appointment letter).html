<h1>Buninjo (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Appointment (Ninkan).html">appointment</a> letter) (補任状)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Buninjo (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Appointment (Ninkan).html">appointment</a> letter) is a generic term of documents issued by an appointer when a specific person is appointed to a governmental post, Ikai (Court rank), and various posts. </p>
<p>Under the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ritsuryo.html">ritsuryo</a> system (a system of centralized government based on the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ritsuryo.html">ritsuryo</a> code), a ceremony in which Iki (a letter of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Appointment (Ninkan).html">appointment</a>) is awarded for Ikai, and a notification of a governmental post by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Senji (imperial decree).html">senji</a> (imperial decree) and its incidental ceremony are implemented at the time of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Appointment (Ninkan).html">appointment</a>. Little is known about the case that a letter is issued for a specific person. However, after the middle of the Heian Period when the procedures of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ritsuryo.html">ritsuryo</a> system (a system of centralized government based on the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ritsuryo.html">ritsuryo</a> code) became relaxed, the case that an <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Appointment (Ninkan).html">appointment</a> was made by the issued <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Appointment (Ninkan).html">appointment</a> letter appeared. The important appointments were made by Iki (a letter of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Appointment (Ninkan).html">appointment</a>) or by imperial decree, but common appointments were generally made by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kuzen.html">kuzen</a> (oral decree). When an <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Appointment (Ninkan).html">appointment</a> for various posts of an influential family is made by themselves, buninjo was used. </p>
<p>The form of bunijo is not based on a specific form, but the buninjo contains the term, `<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Appointment (Ninkan).html">appointment</a>' in a sentence or in a document to make a clear distinction between the buninjo and other documents. The bunijno is based on various forms such as imperial decree, kudashibumi (document issued by a superior or office), and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Migyosho.html">migyosho</a> (a document for informing people of the decision of Third Rank or upper people). It varies depending on the period. Under the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>) and the Muromachi <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>), kudashibumi (edict from a senior official in government or military which had the status of a binding official document) from the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> family or <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Mandokoro.html">Mandokoro</a> were buninjo while autographic signature, Shuinjo(a shogunal license for foreign trade), kokuinjyo were used by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a>, which were Japanese provincial military governors, that became <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a>, which were Japanese feudal lords), <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> (Japanese territorial lord) in the Sengoku period, and under the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Edo bakufu.html">Edo bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>). When a chief priest in the court rank lower than <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Gozan (a term relating to Zen temples).html">gozan</a> (Zen temples highly ranked by the government) is appointed, a document called kojo (an official writ of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Appointment (Ninkan).html">appointment</a> to the chief priest of Zen temple) is issued. The special buninjo called `Inari no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kumon (official document).html">kumon</a>' is issued when an influential monk assumes another post as a chief priest of a temple where he doesn't actually live. On top of those buninjo, buninjo such as andojo (a letter to secure safety) or ate okonai jo existed as well. </p>
