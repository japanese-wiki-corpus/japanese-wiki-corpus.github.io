<h1>Junshaku (巡爵)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Junshaku is a customary practice of conferring a Court rank on <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kurodo (Chamberlain).html">kurodo</a> (chamberlain), which developed in the early Heian period. </p>
<p>Summary<br/>
Junshaku is promoting one of the government officials of the sixth rank belonging to the divisions of Shikibu, Minbu (popular affairs), Geki (Secretary of the Grand Council of State), or <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shiki (a rank in government offices under ritsuryo system).html">Shiki</a> to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Jugoi (Junior Fifth Rank) (a rank in Japan).html">Jugoi</a> (Junior Fifth Rank), in accordance with tenure (the number of years in service), at <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Jimoku (ceremony for appointing officials).html">Jimoku</a> (ceremony for appointing officials) performed by Daijokan (Grand Council of State) on every New Year's day. Junshaku of government officials of the sixth rank at Kurododokoro (the Chamberlain's office) is a well-known case of Junshaku. It is said that <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kurodo (Chamberlain).html">kurodo</a> with the longest tenure, in other words gokuro, was ennobled every year with the exception of the cases where the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kurodo (Chamberlain).html">kurodo</a> was allowed to remain in office (joryu), and that most of them made the transition to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kokushi.html">kokushi</a> (provincial governors). The promoted <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kurodo (Chamberlain).html">kurodo</a> is said to have left the court and assumed the position of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kurodo (Chamberlain).html">Kurodo</a> no goi. Those who decided not to leave the court made a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Point (Sentoki).html">point</a> of not being ennobled in order to remain at the sixth rank, and restarted a career as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kurodo (Chamberlain).html">kurodo</a> at the lowest rank. Thus, the custom of gekitai (that the sixth rank <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kurodo (Chamberlain).html">kurodo</a> declines the peerage and gets demoted to Shinkurodo in order to remain as Tenjobito) sprang up. </p>
