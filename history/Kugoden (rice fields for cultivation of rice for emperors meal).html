<h1>Kugoden (rice fields for cultivation of rice for emperor's meal) (供御田)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kugoden refers to rice fields to cultivate rice (Kugomai) for emperor's meals (Kugo). It was also called Miineta. </p>
<p>In the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ritsuryo.html">ritsuryo</a> system, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kanden (imperial estates).html">Kanden</a> (imperial estates) undertook that role and was controlled by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Oiryo.html">Oiryo</a> (Bureau of Palace Kitchens under the Ministry of the Imperial Household), but incomes became unstable by reasons that <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kanden (imperial estates).html">Kanden</a> was lost in various places due to decline of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ritsuryo.html">ritsuryo</a> system and expansion of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shoen.html">Shoen</a> (manor in medieval Japan), and nonpayment of tribute of Kugomai continued. Therefore, in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Insei.html">insei</a> period (during the period of the government by the retired Emperor), independent Miineta/Kugoden and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kugonin.html">Kugonin</a> (purveyors to the imperial household) managing such Miineta/Kugoden were established mainly in the Kinai region (provinces surrounding <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and Nara). According to the "Honcho seiki" (Chronicle of Imperial Reigns), <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kugonin.html">Kugonin</a> managing Miineta in Ishikawa County, Kawachi Province, came up to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and complained of difficult situations in 1149. Thereafter, Kugoden came to be managed as part of Shoshiden (tax exempt lands that were provided to cover the labor cost of Shoshi [officials]) (estate of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Oiryo.html">Oiryo</a>) of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Oiryo.html">Oiryo</a>. </p>
