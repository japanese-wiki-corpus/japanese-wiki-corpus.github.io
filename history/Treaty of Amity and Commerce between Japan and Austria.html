<h1>Treaty of Amity and Commerce between Japan and Austria (日墺修好通商航海条約)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The Japan-Austria Treaty of Amity and Commerce was an agreement concluded between Japan and Austria/Hungarian empire on October 18, 1869. National relations were established through this treaty. At the same time, it was said to be the achievement of an unfair treaty against Japan by western powers. The abbreviation 'kyo,' which stands for Hungary, is sometimes added to the title of the treaty and is read, 'Nichioukyo' (Japan/Austria/Hungary). </p>
<p>It was concluded by and between Japan's Foreign Minister, Nobuyoshi SAWA, and Austria's Anton von Petz who visited Japan while on a mission to establish diplomatic relations between various districts of Asia and they exchanged instruments of ratification on January 12, 1872. </p>
<p>English Minister, Harry Parks mediated for the conclusion of this treaty, and among all the unfair treaties concluded between the Edo government and the Meiji government with Europe and the North America since the Ansei era treaty, the treaty contained the most advantageous conditions, the contents of which applied to all countries who had made "Most Favored Nation Treatment" treaties with Japan. 
<br/>Especially in the field of consular jurisdiction, it turned out to contain the most unfavorable regulations for Japan and was consequently applied to other western great powers as well<br/>
With this the West's enforcement of unfair treaties on Japan was completed. </p>
<p>The regulation that used to designate Kanagawa-juku as an open port was modified for the first time to Yokohama bay, which was the actual open port. </p>
