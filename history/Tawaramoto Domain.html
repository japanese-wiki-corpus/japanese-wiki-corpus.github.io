<h1>Tawaramoto Domain (田原本藩)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Tawaramoto Domain existed in Tawaramoto, Toichi-gun, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yamato Province.html">Yamato Province</a> (present-day Tawaramoto, Tawaramoto-cho, Shiki-gun, Nara Prefecture). </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>Tawaramoto Domain was ruled by the Hirano clan. However, it was founded officially on August 31, 1868 as the so-called 'domain founded by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Meiji Restoration (Meiji-ishin).html">Meiji Restoration</a>' at the discretion of the new government to grant the clan a status of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> (Japanese feudal lord) with the crop yield of 10,000 koku (an unit of assessed crop yields of the land [1 koku: about 180 liter], which was also used to express the size of the land). Founder of the Hirano clan Nagayasu HIRANO served <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI.html">Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI</a>, becoming one of the "Seven Spears of Shizugatake," alongside <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kiyomasa KATO.html">Kiyomasa KATO</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Masanori FUKUSHIMA.html">Masanori FUKUSHIMA</a>, for their military success in the 1583 Battle of Shizugatake and was awarded a territory in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yamato Province.html">Yamato Province</a> with 5,000 koku. 
<br/>Although Nagayasu did not make any major contributions subsequently, he solidified control of the domain, implemented benevolent rule and brought prosperity, with Terauchi-cho nicknamed 'Osaka of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yamato.html">Yamato</a>.'<br/>
</p>
<p>After Nagayasu's death, his successor Nagakatsu HIRANO worked on the construction of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Jinya.html">jinya</a> (regional government office). Due to the small size of the domain, however, financial conditions gradually declined; from the middle of the Edo period onward goyokin (the money the government charged temporarily on farmers and merchants) was imposed on the people of the domain for a number of times. Hirano clan rule lasted for nine generations, but it was only three years that the clan had the official status of domain lord. </p>
