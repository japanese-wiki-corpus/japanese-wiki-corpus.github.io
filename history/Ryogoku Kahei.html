<p></p>
<p>Ryogoku (daimyos' own territory) kahei (coins) are gold and silver coins which daimyos (Japanese feudal lords) at various places ordered to mint for circulation in their territories from the Sengoku period to the early Edo period, and are also called Ryogoku Kingin (gold and silver). </p>
<p>Ryogoku kahei may also be called <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Chiho.html">chiho</a> (regions) kahei, but the former is distinguished from the latter, because the word '<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Chiho.html">chiho</a> kahei' was used to mean the coins for circulation inside the territories, which were frequently issued by various domains, mainly toward the end of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Edo Period.html">Edo Period</a>. </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>Ryogoku kahei referred to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Chiho.html">chiho</a> hallmark silver used mainly for commercial transactions, and in many cases included gold and silver coins, which were awarded to those who had rendered distinguished services in the Sengoku period. </p>
<p>Since the middle of the 16th century, namely the Sengoku period, demand for gold and silver increased for financing the war effort and for giving awards, and therefore gold and silver mines were actively developed to increase the production of gold and silver, especially the latter, the production of which was world's biggest and is estimated to have reached one third of the entire world's production. </p>
<p>The sakin (gold dust) which had been produced in Mutsu Province from time immemorial was used for transactions on the basis of quality and quantity; and in the course of time, nerikin (agglutinate gold) made of dissolved sakin with a hallmark put on or takenagashikin (gold agglomeration made by putting dissolved sakin into a bamboo cylinder) began to be used, and furthermore bankin (gold coins) such as hirumokin (gold plate like a leaf of hirumo [a plant which grows on the sea sand]) which were made by beating gold blocks into the form of plates began to be made, and at first they were circulated as Hyodo kahei (currency valued by weight). </p>
<p>Also, gokuin-gin (hallmarked cupelled silver) made by putting hallmarks to haifuki-gin (cupelled silver) produced at many silver mines which were dotted from western Japan to Hokuriku and Tohoku regions, and kirigin which were used by cutting gokuin-gin into smaller (rectangular) pieces (each with a hallmark) began to be used as silver-by-weight standard for transaction. These gokuin-gins are described in such literature as "Shokoku (various districts) Haifuki-gin Yose (collection)", and many of them are rarely found, but some of them are exhibited in the Mint Musium. Ko-chogin (silver bars which had been produced before 1601) were made by beating haifuki-gin, but they were brittle and easily cracked because of containing impure substance, and could not be made thin like gold and so <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Chogin (Silver coins).html">chogin</a> were in the shape of yuzuriha (Daphniphyllum macropodum) or in the pig style. </p>
<p>As mentioned above, gold and silver coins were minted by vendors such as kinya (gold shops) and ginya (silver shops) from the materials produced at gold mines and silver mines in daimyos' own territories, however, they were used as payments for importing weapons such as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Hinawaju (matchlock gun).html">hinawaju</a> (matchlock guns), raw silk thread, Asian ginseng, and so on, and a large amount of them flowed to foreign countries. Also, the Sengoku period was a period of of competition for gold mines and silver mines at various places. </p>
<p>It is said that <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Motonari MORI.html">Motonari MORI</a>, who had the Iwami Ginzan Silver Mine in his territory, issued Sekishu <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Chogin (Silver coins).html">chogin</a>, etc., that Koshu Kin (gold coins) were minted by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Shingen TAKEDA.html">Shingen TAKEDA</a>, who had many gold mines such as the Kurokawa Gold Mine, etc., and were succeeded by the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Koban.html">koban</a> (former Japanese oval gold coin) currency system (ryo, bu, shu) of the Tokugawa shogunate, and that <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Kenshin UESUGI.html">Kenshin UESUGI</a> issued Tensho Etsuza Kin; however in each case very few actual examples of them currently exist. Also, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI.html">Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI</a> issued so-called Taiko (retired imperial <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Regent.html">regent</a>) Kinginsen (gold and silver coins), such as Tensho-Oban (gold coins issued in 1588) and Tensho-Tsuho (coins issued in 1587); however, in many cases, Oban, Chogi, etc., which were intended for the unification of the whole country, are not included in ryogoku kahei. Once these coins entered the market, many of them were taken to money changers, such as gold shops or silver shops, and converted to senka (base metal coins) for use, as the precious metals were worth more than their money value. </p>
<p>Keicho <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Koban.html">koban</a> (oval gold coin) and keicho <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Chogin (Silver coins).html">chogin</a> (oval silver coin), which can be considered as ryogoku kahei issued by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Ieyasu TOKUGAWA.html">Ieyasu TOKUGAWA</a>, eventually established their position as an official currency cast by the government for the unification of the whole country, but were not made sufficiently available in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Chiho.html">chiho</a> (regions) because a large amount of Keicho gold and silver flowed out to foreign countries, failing in the nation-wide currency unification, and therefore, ryogoku kahei such as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Chiho.html">chiho</a> hallmark silver issued by silver mines at various places, were still used in parallel, serving to fill the shortage of Keicho gold and silver, silently allowed to circulate, and used by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> (Japanese feudal lords) of various provinces also as a means to exchange with Keicho gold coins, the central currency at the time of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Sankin-kotai (daimyos alternate-year residence in Edo).html">Sankin-kotai</a> (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a>'s alternate-year residence in Edo). At the end of 17th century when lower-quality Genroku <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Koban.html">Koban</a> (oval gold coins) and Genroku <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Chogin (Silver coins).html">chogin</a> (oval silver coins) were issued, the calling-back of ryogoku kahei by kin-zas (organizations in charge of casting and appraising of gold during the Edo period) and gin-zas (organizations in charge of casting and appraising of silver during the Edo period) made progress and the unification of currency was achieved at long last. On the other hand, in Kai Province, which was a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Tenryo (Shogunal Demesne).html">tenryo</a> (a shogunal demesne), the Matsumoto family, the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Koshu (title).html">Koshu</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kin-za.html">kin-za</a>, was allowed to continue the issue of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Koshu (title).html">Koshu</a> kin, lasting till the Gembun era (1736-1740). </p>
<p>"Sankazue" (Picture Collection of Three Coins: History of Coinage in Japan), authored by Morishige KONDO and Naokata KUSAMA, includes many gold and silver coins issued from the Sengoku period to the Edo period, among which there were even those created later on and not a few of which were made using the old diagrams and are now treated as ganshohin (ornamental items), but many of them lack accurate records, and it is unknown whether some of them were originally circulated coins or ganshohin. <h3>Gold coins</h3>
