<h1>Hanmoto Mitodoke (a government officer job in the Edo period) (判元見届)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Hanmoto Mitodoke was a term used to describe the act of confirmation by a government officer that was sent from the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Edo bakufu.html">Edo bakufu</a>, when a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> family applied for matsugo-yoshi (adopting a son on the family head's deathbed). It was performed to confirm whether the family head (Hanmoto) who was in critical condition was still alive, and to check if there were anything questionable about the application. It was also performed to prevent cases where the seal on the application for matsugo yoshi had been forged, since the family head who was supposed to affix his seal on the application had already deceased. </p>
<p>With the presence of the family head, relatives of the son who was to be adopted, and one who was able to function as the family head, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Ometsuke (inspector general).html">Ometsuke</a> (chief inspector of the Edo shogunate) made the confirmation for <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> families, and for <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Hatamoto (direct retainers of shogun).html">Hatamoto</a> (a direct retainer of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> family) or Gokennin (also a direct retainer of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> family but ranked lower than <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Hatamoto (direct retainers of shogun).html">Hatamoto</a>), kashira (head) or shihai of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Hatamoto (direct retainers of shogun).html">Hatamoto</a> or <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Gokenin.html">Gokenin</a> group (when no kashira or shihai was available, it was carried out by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Metsuke (a governmental post of the Edo bakufu).html">Metsuke</a> [inspector of foot soldiers] officer) made the confirmation. Afterwards, in the case for a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Hatamoto (direct retainers of shogun).html">Hatamoto</a> or <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Gokenin.html">Gokenin</a>, another matsugo-yoshi application was generated anew by the kashira (head) or shihai of his <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Hatamoto (direct retainers of shogun).html">Hatamoto</a> or <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Gokenin.html">Gokenin</a> group, and both applications were submitted to Roju (the second-highest governmental post in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Edo bakufu.html">Edo bakufu</a>) and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Wakadoshiyori.html">Wakadoshiyori</a> (the managerial post just under Roju). </p>
