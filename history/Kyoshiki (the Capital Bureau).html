<h1>Kyoshiki (the Capital Bureau) (京職)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kyoshiki refers to a capital administrative agency in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ritsuryo.html">Ritsuryo</a> system (a system of centralized government based on the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ritsuryo.html">ritsuryo</a> code). 
<br/>In the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ritsuryo.html">Ritsuryo</a> system, it was conventional to divide the Capital into the east part and west part, and to call the east part 'Sakyo,' and call the west part 'Ukyo.'<br/>
Therefore, Kyoshiki was established in the east part and the west part, respectively, and each office was called 'Sakyoshiki' (Eastern Capital Offices) and 'Ukyoshiki' (Western Capital Offices). </p>
<p><h3>Official duties</h3>
</p>
<p>Kyoshiki supervised all matters concerning administration, security and justice relating to the Capital. Kyoshiki was equivalent to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kokushi.html">Kokushi</a> (Provincial Offices) in the province, but, its social status was higher than that of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kokushi.html">Kokushi</a>, and Kyoshiki was treated as kyokan (central government official) while <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kokushi.html">Kokushi</a> was treated as an outside official (local official). In order to assist administrative affairs, Borei (chief of the four districts of the capital) was placed at each jo (east-west district), and Bocho (chief of each district of the capital) (town mayor) was placed at each bo (north-west district), and then, the Capital was supervised in every hole and corner. Borei and Bocho were equivalent to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Gunji.html">Gunji</a> (local magistrates) and Richo (village chief), respectively. The full number of Borei was 12 under the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ritsuryo.html">Ritsuryo</a> system, but was changed along with the transfer of the capital. There were two offices, Sakyoshiki and Ukyoshiki, to govern Sakyo and Ukyo, respectively. As <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Hikan (low ranking clerks).html">hikan</a> (low-level bureaucrat), ichi no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Tsukasa (a rank in government offices).html">tsukasa</a> (governmental organization) existed, and Sakyoshiki having jurisdiction over <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Higashi (dry sweets; dry confectionary).html">Higashi</a> no ichi no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Tsukasa (a rank in government offices).html">tsukasa</a>, and Ukyoshiki having jurisdiction over Nishi no ichi no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Tsukasa (a rank in government offices).html">tsukasa</a> handled affairs concerning market. Thereafter, the power of security was usurped by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kebiishi (police and judicial chief).html">Kebiishi</a> (officials with judicial and police powers) in the Heian period, and Kyoshiki came to lose its substance along with the ruin of the imperial capital (esp. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>). Its Tang name was Keicho. </p>
<p>In the Muromachi period, Soke (the head family or house) of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/family/Hosokawa clan.html">Hosokawa clan</a>, one of three <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kanrei.html">kanrei</a> (shogunal deputy), which inherited the post of Ukyo no daibu (Master of the Western Capital Offices), was called the Keicho family. </p>
<p>In the Sengoku period (period of warring states) when the imperial court and court nobles started selling their official court ranks due to financial difficulties, Ukyo no daibu, pronoun of Shogunal Deputy the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/family/Hosokawa clan.html">Hosokawa clan</a> which was the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> family of pedigree, was believed to be the nifitiest official court rank for Sengoku <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> (Japanese territorial lord in the Sengoku period) in provinces (especially for <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> in the Tohoku region) who wanted to add dignity. <h3>Personnel</h3>
