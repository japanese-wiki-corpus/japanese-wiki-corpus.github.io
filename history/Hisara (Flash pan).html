<h1>Hisara (Flash pan) (火皿)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Flash pan is a receptacle sticking out from the side of the barrel for priming powder in matchlock guns and flintlock guns. </p>
<p>The flash pan has a cover called 'hibuta' so that gun powder would not be touched by a source of fire by mistake. Colloquial expression for preparing to fire is 'hibuta o kiru,' which means to take off the cover of the flash pan. </p>
