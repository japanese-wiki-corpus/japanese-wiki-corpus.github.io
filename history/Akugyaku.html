<h1>Akugyaku (悪逆)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Akugyaku was one of hachi-gyaku (eight unpardonable crimes) defined by the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ritsuryo.html">ritsuryo</a> (legal codes of the Nara and Heian periods). It refers to the wounding or killing of the parent(s)/ grandparent(s) or the killing of uncle(s)/ aunt(s), maternal grandparent(s)/elder brother(s)/elder sister(s). In female cases it also included killing their husband and his parent(s). </p>
<p>Among hachi-gyaku it ranked fourth and was regarded as the most serious crime among the problems involving a family. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Apart (Apartment).html">Apart</a> from the gravity of a crime, all social privileges were deprived and also no amnesty was granted. </p>
<p>The term "akugyaku-mudo," which is used today to describe cruel act against humanity, is derived from it. </p>
