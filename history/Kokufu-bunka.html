<h1>Kokufu-bunka (国風文化)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kokufu-bunka is one of the Japanese historical cultures. It was a culture developed during the Sekkan seiji (regency government) period from the early 10th century to the 11th century and has much influenced the culture during the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Insei.html">Insei</a> (cloister government) period in the 12th century. </p>
<p><h3>Characteristics</h3>
</p>
<p>This culture is called <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kokufu.html">Kokufu</a> (or wafu)-bunka or Japanese-style culture, in contrast with the tofu-bunka, a culture in Nara period which was largely influenced by the Chinese culture. Among the existing cultures, many are descended from this kokufu-bunka. <h3>Demise of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Japanese missions to Tang China.html">Japanese missions to Tang China</a></h3>
</p>
<p>In general, people used to think that the stop of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Japanese missions to Tang China.html">Japanese missions to Tang China</a> in 894 allowed Japan to get out of direct influence of the China and to develop its own cultures. But, in reality, even after the demise of its missions to Tang China, Japan had active relations with other countries and many aspects of Chinese learning and culture were introduced. Therefore, an argument that the demise of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Japanese missions to Tang China.html">Japanese missions to Tang China</a> gave birth to Kokufu-bunka is wrong. Already in Nara period, there were many considerations on Kuniburi, the Japan's own morals and feelings although respecting Chinese cultures. Therefore, it is convenient to conclude that the demise of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Japanese missions to Tang China.html">Japanese missions to Tang China</a> was a factor that accelerated making Japanese cultures more kokufu-styled. <h3>Flowering of Jodo sect (Pure Land Buddhism)</h3>
</p>
<p>Jodo sect (faith in Pure Land) was developed on the background of the Latter Day of the Law. In the first part of the ninth century, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Ennin.html">Ennin</a> introduced the Nenbutsu Zanmai Ho (method of mental absorption in the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Buddhist invocation.html">Buddhist invocation</a>) of Wutai Shan (in China) to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Mt. Hiei.html">Mt. Hiei</a> and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Genshin (Monk).html">Genshin</a> (priest) perfected Tendai Jodo sect by writing "<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Ojoyoshu (The Essentials of Salvation).html">Ojoyoshu</a>" (The Essentials of Salvation). Also, Kuya popularized Jodo sect to ordinary people, therefore he was called "Ichi no <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Hijiri (A Japanese Buddhist Priest Who Traveled Around Local Provinces).html">hijiri</a>" (Saint of the People). Jodo sect became widespread in the nobles living in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and influenced Buddhist architecture, statues and painting inspired by Kokufu-bunka. <h3>Flowering of literature by women writers</h3>
</p>
<p>The regime of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Regent.html">regent</a> by the Fujiwara clan (Northern House of the Fujiwara clan) was based on the consort clan policy (a policy consisting in making a daughter enter the Imperial Family and making her child an emperor in order to take power as a maternal grandfather). Once their daughters entered the Imperial Family, the Fujiwara clan selected capable women and put them beside the emperor as female personal assistants to gain the emperor's favor. Female personal assistants were often the girls of middle-classed nobles such as local officers and these middle-classed nobles spared no effort in educating their girls to win the FUJIWARA clan's favor. This is the reason why a number of women writers such as Seisho Nagon and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Murasaki Shikibu.html">Murasaki Shikibu</a> appeared. <h3>Use of kana characters</h3>
</p>
<p>From the Nara period, manyo gana, making use of Chinese manners of reading to read Japanese, had been used; from this period, however, kana (hiragana and katakana --- both Japanese syllabary characters) began to be used. Katakana has been designed from a parts of Kanji characters (example: イ from 伊) and was used as a sub character for reading a text written in China in a Japanese manner. Hiragana was designed from the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Sosho.html">sosho</a> (cursive) style writing of kanji characters (for example あ from 安) and it was mainly women who started to use Hiragana. </p>
<p>Kokin Wakashu Kanajo (Preface of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Kokin Wakashu (A Collection of Ancient and Modern Japanese Poetry).html">Kokin Wakashu</a> written in kana) of the "<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Kokin Wakashu (A Collection of Ancient and Modern Japanese Poetry).html">Kokin Wakashu</a>" (A Collection of Ancient and Modern Japanese Poetry) written by <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/KI no Tsurayuki.html">KI no Tsurayuki</a> was an early work written in Hiragana while keeping the usage of a text in Chinese. 
<br/>(See Hiragana.)<br/>

The <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Byodo-in Temple.html">Byodo-in Temple</a> preserves its influence. </p>
<p>In Buddhist architecture, a lot of Amidanyorai Halls (Amitabha Tathagata Halls) influenced by Jodo sect were constructed. </p>
<p>Muryoju-in Hall of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Hojo-ji Temple.html">Hojo-ji Temple</a>: Constructed by <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/FUJIWARA no Michinaga.html">FUJIWARA no Michinaga</a> in 1020. It does not exit any more. </p>

</p>
<p>Parquet technique, which consists of making geometric mosaic patters of wood pieces, is utilized in order to produce statues of Amida Nyorai in large numbers.

<h3>Painting</h3>
</p>
<p>The Japanese style of painting called Yamato-e was developed and this produced Buddhist painting, painting of natural features on walls and folding screens called "Tsukinami-no-e" and "Shiki-e" (such as Senzui Byobu [folding screen with landscape picture]) and painting on walls (such as tobira-e [the frontispiece] of the Hoo-do Hall of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Byodo-in Temple.html">Byodo-in Temple</a>) but except Buddhist paintings, few paintings remain. It is estimated that many narrative paintings were created (either in books or scrolls), but no such paintings from before the end of the 11th century remain. </p>
<p>Raigo-zu (image of the descent of Amida Buddha) was a theme often chosen in Buddhist painting. </p>
