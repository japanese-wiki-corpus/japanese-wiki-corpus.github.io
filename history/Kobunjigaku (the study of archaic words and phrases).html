<h1>Kobunjigaku (the study of archaic words and phrases) (古文辞学)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kobunjigaku is a school of Confucianism founded by Sorai OGYU in the Edo period. It is also known as the Kenengaku school. It became active in the middle to late Edo period. Academically, it criticized Shushigaku (Neo-Confucianism) and rivaled Kogigaku (the study of ancient principles) by Jinsai ITO. </p>
<p>"Kobunji" is the restoration of literature advocated during the Ming Dynasty in China. Classics that were held up as being models of good literature were poetry from the Tang Dynasty and other writings from the Qin and Han Dynasties. </p>
