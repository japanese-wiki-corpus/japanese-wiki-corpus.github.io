<h1>Childhood Names (幼名)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The term "childhood name" (yomyo or yomei in Japanese) refers to a name for use by someone only in his childhood (this custom was more or less limited to male children). Osanana and shoji are two other terms that can be used to describe this same type of childhood name. </p>
<p>Such childhood names were in use primarily from the Heian through to the Edo periods for the children of military or noble families during their childhoods, and most often ceased to be used once the child passed through the coming of age ceremony and received his imina (real name) for adulthood. The names of members of the peasant class were also called "yomyo" (childhood names), but unlike the children of the upper class, they did not receive an imina at adulthood. </p>
<p><h3>The custom of passing on and inheriting yomyo</h3>
</p>
<p>Many military families adopted the tradition of passing childhood names down generation to generation. Examples abound: the name the Shogunal branch of the Tokugawa family passed down was Takechiyo, while that of the Owari branch of the Tokugawa family was Gorota, that of the Kishu branch (in Kii Province) of the Tokugawa family Chofukumaru, that for the Mito branch of the Tokugawa family Tsuruchiyo, and that of the Maeda clan Inuchiyo, as well as countless others. Each such name had originally been the childhood name of the founder of the family (so for example, the name Takechiyo had been the first Edo-period Shogun, Ieyasu TOKUGAWA's name, while Gorota had been the Owari branch progenitor Yoshinao TOKUGAWA's, Chofukumaru the Kishu branch founder Yorinobu TOKUGAWA's, Tsuruchiyo the Mito branch forefather Yorifusa TOKUGAWA's, and Inuchiyo the Kaga Domain patriarch Toshiie MAEDA's), and each was passed down from family head to the son being groomed as heir, becoming their childhood name in turn; this passing down continued from generation to generation. <h3>List of childhood names passed down from generation to generation among military families</h3>
