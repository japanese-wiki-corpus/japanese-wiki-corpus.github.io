<h1>Rakuin (an illegitimate child) (落胤)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Rakuin is an illegitimate child who is not recognized by his or her father as his child. In particular, rakuin of high class people often comes to an issue. Rakuin is also called as Otoshiin or Otoshigo. They were not recognized as a family of true blood line, therefore they were normally not written in a family pedigree nor appeared in the history. </p>
<p>Though they lived among common people in most cases, they sometimes claimed to be a true heir of authority and were used by powerful people. However, there was no evidence that most of the people on center of the historical stage were real rakuin who had the true blood line (for example Kaigyo TENICHIBO who pretended to be rakuin). Many cases are questioned whether they were true by researchers. </p>
