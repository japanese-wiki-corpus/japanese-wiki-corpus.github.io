<h1>Rekishimachi (Historical town) (歴史町)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Rekishimachi was one of Japanese city forms. It was also referred to as historical settlement. </p>
<p>Summary<br/>
It was a general term for a city form developed in a historical background and social conditions during the Medieval and the Early Modern periods, mainly in Japan. Alternatively, it meant towns and the rows of houses and buildings in present day Japan that originated under the aforementioned historical factors, and especially those that have conserved the atmosphere of those days. </p>
<p>Especially the history towns which conserved the rows of houses and buildings were of great value in the historical and cultural sense so, they were designated as World Heritage sites or Important traditional building Preservation Area, or they were considered tourist destinations. If not in the aforementioned state, many of them had their rows of houses and buildings conserved by the efforts of their residents. </p>
