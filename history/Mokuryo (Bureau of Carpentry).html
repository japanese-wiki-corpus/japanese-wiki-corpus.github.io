<h1>Mokuryo (Bureau of Carpentry) (木工寮)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Mokuryo refers to an institution that belonged to Kunaisho (Imperial Household Ministry) in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ritsuryo.html">Ritsuryo</a> system (a system of centralized government based on the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ritsuryo.html">ritsuryo</a> code) of Japan adopting the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ritsuryo.html">Ritsuryo</a> system. Its Japanese name was Kodakumi no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Tsukasa (a rank in government offices).html">tsukasa</a>. </p>
<p>This was a government office which was mainly in charge of constructions and collections of lumber, and controlled each workman. </p>
<p><h3>Official duties</h3>
</p>
<p>Mokuryo solely undertook constructions, civil engineering and repairs of the Imperial Court. Concretely speaking, its official duties were constructions and repairs of palace, repairs of public facilities within the imperial capital (esp. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>), manufacturing of wooden products, and so on. Therefore, it had many things to do, and many workpeople and physical workers belonged to it. Even so, since work was troublesome and delayed, palace-related operations were transferred to newly-established <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shurishiki (The Palace Repairs Office).html">Shurishiki</a> (The Palace Repairs Office) in 818, and civil engineering work within the imperial capital was transferred to newly-established Shuribojoshi around the same time, respectively. After that, an improvement or elimination of operations was also repeated frequently. </p>
<p>When the imperial capital was newly constructed, Zokyoshi had jurisdiction over the development of imperial capital, Zogushiki (Office of Making Palaces) (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Zogusho (Ministry of Making and Mending Palaces).html">Zogusho</a> [Ministry of Making and Mending Palaces]) had jurisdiction over the construction of palace, and each <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Zojishi (Officials in Charge of Building Temples).html">Zojishi</a> (Officials in Charge of Building Temples) had jurisdiction over the construction of temple. And, office buildings of authorities were constructed under the direction of Mokuryo. Among the above, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Zogusho (Ministry of Making and Mending Palaces).html">Zogusho</a> and Zo-Todaiji-shi (Office of Construction of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Todai-ji Temple.html">Todai-ji Temple</a>) remained through the Nara period. Unlike other government officials in charge of work site operations, an <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Appointment (Ninkan).html">appointment</a> of Takumibe, the chief of construction work from tomo no miyatsuko (Servant of the Court administering a group), was made according to their respective abilities, not by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Heredity.html">heredity</a>. Also woodworkers mainly requisitioned from the Hida Province came along with them as their subordinates. Kajitsube (blacksmith's working place) that belonged to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kajishi.html">Kajishi</a> (Office of Smithery) was transferred to Mokuryo as a result of merging <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kajishi.html">Kajishi</a> in 808, but it ceased to exist. <h3>Personnel</h3>

Takumibe was equivalent to tomo no miyatsuko working as a chief of construction work. </p>
