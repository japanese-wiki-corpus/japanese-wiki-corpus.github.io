<h1>Kanin-ryu (a linage of court noble of a branch one of the Fujiwara clique) (閑院流)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kanin-ryu was a linage of kuge (court noble) of a branch of the Northern House of the Fujiwara clan including the Sanjo Family, the Saionji Family, or the Tokudaiji family. The family came into power by gaining maternal relatives in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Insei.html">insei</a> period (during the period of the government by the retired emperor). </p>
<p>Kanin-ryu was originated from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Kinsue.html">FUJIWARA no Kinsue</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kanin (official seal).html">Kanin</a> minister, an uncle of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Michinaga.html">FUJIWARA no Michinaga</a>. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kanin (official seal).html">Kanin</a> was originally the residence of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Fuyutsugu.html">FUJIWARA no Fuyutsugu</a> who formed the basis of the Northern House's prosperity, before it was inherited and lived by Kinsue, then it was also used as a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Satodairi (temporary imperial palace).html">satodairi</a> (a temporary palace) from the end of the Heian period to the early <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period. </p>
<p>Although his daughter whom he made judai (an Imperial Consort's bridal entry into court) had no Imperial princes and princesses, Kinsue held the post of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Naidaijin (inner minister).html">Naidaijin</a> (Minister of the Palace) for a long time under the administration of Michinaga to support the Michinaga's government then he was promoted to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daijo-daijin (Grand minister of state).html">Daijo-daijin</a> (Grand minister of state) in his last days after appointed to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Udaijin (Minister of the Right).html">Udaijin</a> (Minister of the Right). </p>
<p>He started to dominate the power as a maternal relative of the emperor for generations from around when <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/FUJIWARA no Moshi.html">FUJIWARA no Moshi</a>, the daughter of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Kinnari.html">FUJIWARA no Kinnari</a>, the third, became an adopted daughter of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Yoshinobu.html">FUJIWARA no Yoshinobu</a> and married <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Gosanjo.html">Emperor Gosanjo</a> to have the child, the Emperor <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Shirakawa (the surroundings of the old capital, Kyoto).html">Shirakawa</a>.

<br/>When <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Toba.html">Emperor Toba</a> ascended the throne, Kinzane took lightly <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Tadazane.html">FUJIWARA no Tadazane</a>, young family head of Sekkan-ke (line of regents and advisers) and argued that he himself who had been at the position of maternal father of the young Emperor should have assumed the post of Sessho (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Regent.html">regent</a> to the emperor), but he was scoffed at by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Toshiaki.html">MINAMOTO no Toshiaki</a>, Chief of the Office of the Retired Emperor <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Shirakawa (the surroundings of the old capital, Kyoto).html">Shirakawa</a>, reproving that 'the man who had served for four emperors as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shodaibu (aristocracy lower than Kugyo).html">Shodaibu</a> (aristocracy lower than court nobles) still tried to seek the post of Sekkan (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Regent.html">regent</a> and adviser).'<br/>
In the generation of Kinzane's children, the family split into three major families of Sanjo, Saionji, and Tokudaiji. </p>
<p>In the Fujiwara clan of the Kanin-ryu, four families as Sanjo, Saionji, Tokudaiji, and Kikutei, a branch family of the Saionji family, becoming the Seiga family, the next Kakaku (family status) rank after Sekke, and two families as Ogimachisanjo and Sanjonishi, both were branch of the Sanjo family, becoming the Daijin family (the house of minister), the rank after the Seiga family, had influence among court nobles, and they were blessed with prosperity along with 19 other families such as the Urin family. There are some exception but it was the family's custom to alternately use the Chinese characters '公' and '実' in the names of the head of the families. 季' was also used as tsuji (distinctive character used in the names of all people belonging to a single clan or lineage). </p>
