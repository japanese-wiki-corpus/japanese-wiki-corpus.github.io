<h1>Naizenshi (Imperial Table Office) (内膳司)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Naizenshi was an institution belonging to Kunaisho (Ministry of the Sovereign's Household) in Japanese government-regulated organization or facility, etc. 
<br/>The Japanese reading is 'Uchinokashiwade no <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Tsukasa (a rank in government offices).html">tsukasa</a>.'<br/>
The government quarters were in the south side of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Kuraryo.html">Kuraryo</a> (Bureau of Palace Storehouses). The classification of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Tsukasa (a rank in government offices).html">tsukasa</a> was <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Daishi (priest).html">Daishi</a>. </p>
<p>Official duties<br/>
Before the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Taiho Ritsuryo (Taiho Code).html">Taiho Ritsuryo</a> (Taiho Code), it was a government office called Zenshiki, but when the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Taiho Ritsuryo (Taiho Code).html">Taiho Ritsuryo</a> was formulated it was divided into <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Daizenshiki (Office of the Palace Table).html">Daizenshiki</a> which cooked and served foods in a feast and Naizenshi which cooked, served and delivered foods for the Emperor's daily diet. In addition to the institution which had 'inside' and 'outside' like this, there were <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Tenyakuryo.html">Tenyakuryo</a> (the Bureau of Medicine), <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Naiyakushi.html">Naiyakushi</a> (Palace Medical Office) and so on. Later in 896, it absorbed <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Enchishi.html">Enchishi</a> (Gardens and Ponds Office) that belonged to Kunaisho as well. </p>
<p><h3>Personnel</h3>
</p>
<p>Betto (an administrator). Naizenshi's betto. The fixed number was one. The official court rank was Sanmi (Third Rank). Afterwards it was set up and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Dainagon (chief councilor of state).html">Dainagon</a> (Major Counselor) or <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Chunagon.html">Chunagon</a> (middle counselor) concurrently held the post. </p>

<br/>Before the establishment of Naizenshi the Takahashi clan (later, the Hamashima family) and the Azumi clan were in charge of serving foods to the Emperor and both clans were in charge of the director post as 'buzen' and 'Kami' was not put, but later the director post was assigned to the other clans, where the other clans identified themselves as 'Kami.'<br/>
After that, when both the Takahashi and Azumi clans were in charge of the director post, they identified themselves as 'buzen' (after the Azumi clan was at strife with the Takahashi clan and was extinguished during the time of Emperor Kanmu, and thus the position of buzen became seshu <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shiki (a rank in government offices under ritsuryo system).html">shiki</a> [hereditary agency] of the Takahashi clan) and when the other clans except for the Takahashi and Azumi clans were in charge of the director post, they identified themselves as 'Kami.'<br/>
