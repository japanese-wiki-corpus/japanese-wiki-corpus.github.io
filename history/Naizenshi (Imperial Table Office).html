<h1>Naizenshi (Imperial Table Office) (内膳司)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Naizenshi was an institution belonging to Kunaisho (Ministry of the Sovereign's Household) in Japanese government-regulated organization or facility, etc. 
<br/>The Japanese reading is 'Uchinokashiwade no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Tsukasa (a rank in government offices).html">tsukasa</a>.'<br/>
The government quarters were in the south side of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kuraryo.html">Kuraryo</a> (Bureau of Palace Storehouses). The classification of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Tsukasa (a rank in government offices).html">tsukasa</a> was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Daishi (priest).html">Daishi</a>. </p>

In addition to the institution which had 'inside' and 'outside' like this, there were <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Tenyakuryo.html">Tenyakuryo</a> (the Bureau of Medicine), <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Naiyakushi.html">Naiyakushi</a> (Palace Medical Office) and so on. Later in 896, it absorbed <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Enchishi.html">Enchishi</a> (Gardens and Ponds Office) that belonged to Kunaisho as well. </p>
