<h1>Gyojisho (行事所)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The Gyojisho came into existence in the Daijoe (first ceremonial offering of rice by newly-enthroned Emperor) and so on in about the middle ninth century, gradually grew into a functionality-oriented project team in various regular/temporal rites and festivals, and dealt with general affairs of rites and festivals including supplying necessary goods. Generally it consisted of one Shokei (chief), Benkan (Oversight Department) and fuhito (note-takers). </p>
<p>The Shokei was able to report to an emperor through Kurodo (Chamberlain) or the court, not via the Daijokan (Grand Council of State), asking for instructions from a Sekkan (regent to the emperor) as needed. </p>
<p>From the middle tenth century, this Gyojisho, as an independent economic base, began to collect clothing from various districts and became an important pillar of executing imperial court affairs. </p>
<p>The above is about the Gyojisho in the Heian period, and even today a Gyojisho is set in a big shrine or changed into a 'yaku.'<br/>
