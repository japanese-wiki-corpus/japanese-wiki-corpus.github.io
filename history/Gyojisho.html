<h1>Gyojisho (行事所)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The Gyojisho came into existence in the Daijoe (first ceremonial offering of rice by newly-enthroned Emperor) and so on in about the middle ninth century, gradually grew into a functionality-oriented project team in various regular/temporal rites and festivals, and dealt with general affairs of rites and festivals including supplying necessary goods. Generally it consisted of one <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shokei (court novels who work at the Imperial Court in high ranking posts).html">Shokei</a> (chief), <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Benkan (Collective name of posts in Daijokan).html">Benkan</a> (Oversight Department) and fuhito (note-takers). </p>
<p>The <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shokei (court novels who work at the Imperial Court in high ranking posts).html">Shokei</a> was able to report to an emperor through <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kurodo (Chamberlain).html">Kurodo</a> (Chamberlain) or the court, not via the Daijokan (Grand Council of State), asking for instructions from a Sekkan (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Regent.html">regent</a> to the emperor) as needed. </p>
<p>From the middle tenth century, this Gyojisho, as an independent economic base, began to collect clothing from various districts and became an important pillar of executing imperial court affairs. </p>
<p>The above is about the Gyojisho in the Heian period, and even today a Gyojisho is set in a big shrine or changed into a 'yaku.'<br/>
