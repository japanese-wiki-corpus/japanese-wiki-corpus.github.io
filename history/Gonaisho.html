<h1>Gonaisho (御内書)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Gonaisho was an official document written in the style of a private letter that was issued by the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Seii Taishogun.html">Seii Taishogun</a> (literally, great general who subdues the barbarians) of the Muromachi <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>). </p>
<p>Although a Gonaisho was written in the style of a private letter with the sender's name written in the text, a kao (written seal mark) or shohan (signature/seal) was added to the document by the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> himself. As a result, these documents were deemed as a kind of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Migyosho.html">Migyosho</a> (an official document informing people of a government decision), and even though it was more of a private order made by the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>, it had the legal weight equivalent to an official <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> order. It was initially issued mainly for the purpose of conveying the private business of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>. During the late Muromachi period, however, Gonaisho were increasingly issued in place of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Migyosho.html">Migyosho</a> issued by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kanrei.html">kanrei</a> (shogunal deputy), and its nature became more of a quasi-official document used by the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> to directly inform people of his intentions. The <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Edo bakufu.html">Edo bakufu</a> inherited the Gonaisho as a document to inform people of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>'s intentions. It was customary that, under normal circumstances, a Gonaisho was issued with an accompanying letter by an attendant who was a close aide to the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>. There were two kinds of documentary forms, more specifically one which used respectful words in writing the name of the addressee and ending the letter, and a normal letter which did not use respectful words. Each type of form was separately used depending on the court rank and social status of the addressee. </p>
<p>Kojo, an official written <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Appointment (Ninkan).html">appointment</a> to the chief of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Gozan (a term relating to Zen temples).html">gozan</a> (five great Zen temples in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>) was issued either as a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Migyosho.html">Migyosho</a> or Gonaisho. It is also believed that orders given by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshiaki ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshiaki ASHIKAGA</a> appealing to territorial lords to overthrow <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Nobunaga ODA.html">Nobunaga ODA</a> were issued using Gonaisho. </p>
