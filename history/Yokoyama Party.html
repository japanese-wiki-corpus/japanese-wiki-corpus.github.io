<h1>Yokoyama Party (横山党)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The Yokoyama Party, centered in the Yokoyama-sho estate in Tama County, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Musashi Province.html">Musashi Province</a> (the present Hachioji City, Tokyo), was an armed group from the same family that existed from the late Heian period to the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period, and based themselves in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Musashi Province.html">Musashi Province</a> (Osato County, Hiki County, and Tachibana County) and the northern part of Sagami Province. It was one of the Musashi-shichito Parties (seven parties of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Musashi Province.html">Musashi Province</a>). Ienaga CHUJO, who was involved in the establishment of code of conduct for <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> as the first member of the Council of State, and Suetaka AIKO, who was a very skillful archer and slew Shigetada HATAKEYAMA, were well known as members of the Party. The party fell at the Battle of WADA. Inomata Party was also in this family. </p>
<p><h3>Place of origin</h3>
</p>
<p>It is generally believed that the party were descendants of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/ONO no Takamura.html">ONO no Takamura</a>; however, Motohisa YASUDA carefully examined family trees, and calculated the number of years among generations, and studied appointments of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Kokushi.html">kokushi</a> (provincial governors) at that time, and consequently thought that this was contrived by later generations, and the party were actually descendants of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Kaihatsu-Ryoshu.html">kaihatsu-ryoshu</a> (local notables who actually developed the land), and passively supported a view that the party may have been descendants of Musashinokuni-no-MIYATSUKO, which is a view found in the "Seishi Kakei Jiten" (Dictionary of Family Names and Lineages in Japan) by Akira OTA. </p>
<p>It is believed that the party was based in Yokoyama, Tama County, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Musashi Province.html">Musashi Province</a> (the present Moto-Yokoyama Town, Hachioji City, Tokyo) and gave themselves the family name of Yokoyama. 
<br/>At that time, 'yokoyama' referred to the Tama Hills and in "<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Manyoshu (Collection of Ten Thousand Leaves).html">Manyoshu</a>" (the oldest anthology of Japanese poetry) the hills are called 'yokoyama in Tama.'<br/>
<h3>Heian period</h3>
</p>
<p>In 924, when the Ono clan arrived to take up Musashi no kami (Governor of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Musashi Province.html">Musashi Province</a>), the clan erected Hachimanyakumo-jinja Shrine to transfer a divided tutelary deity of Iwashimizu Hachiman-gu Shrine to a new location. </p>
<p>In 1113, because of the murder of Naiki Taro AIKO, the members of the party were searched out and destroyed. The party was subject to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/MINAMOTO no Tameyoshi.html">MINAMOTO no Tameyoshi</a>. </p>
<p>During the Hogen War in 1156, and the Heiji War in 1159, the party followed the troops under <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/MINAMOTO no Tameyoshi.html">MINAMOTO no Tameyoshi</a>'s command (some say that the party was subordinate to the Hatakeyama clan) and they fought bravely. <h3><a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period</h3>
</p>
<p>According to "<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Heike Monogatari (The tale of the Heike).html">Heike Monogatari</a>" (The tale of the Heike), the party also took an active part in the Jisho-Juei Civil War. </p>
<p>When <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/MINAMOTO no Yoritomo.html">MINAMOTO no Yoritomo</a> established <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>), as a reward for military service Tokihiro YOKOYAMA from the Yokoyama Party received a fief and was approved as the landowner of the Yokoyama-sho estate. </p>
<p>At the Battle of WADA in 1213 Tokikane YOKOYAMA and his party reinforced <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Yoshimori WADA.html">Yoshimori WADA</a>, and suffered a crushing defeat in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a>. </p>
<p>Yokoyama-sho estate, which was the base of the Yokoyama Party, was given to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/OE no Hiromoto.html">OE no Hiromoto</a>. In 1214, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/OE no Hiromoto.html">OE no Hiromoto</a> founded Yokoyama-jinja Shrine to enshrine Yoshitaka YOKOYAMA, the founder of the Yokoyama Party, in the precincts of Hachimanyakumo-jinja Shrine. </p>
<p>Motohisa YASUDA assumes that with its many branch families the Yokoyama Party would have been proud of its power and influence. </p>
