<h1>Ossho (負所)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The term "Ossho" means the lords of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shoen.html">Shoen</a> (manor in medieval Japan) were exempted from and allowed to collect Zatsueki (a kind tax under the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ritsuryo.html">Ritsuryo</a> system) (sometimes inclusive of the portion of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kanmotsu.html">Kanmotsu</a> (tribute goods -supposed to be paid to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kokuga (provincial government office compounds).html">Kokuga</a> (provincial government offices) as well as the land of such <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shoen.html">Shoen</a>. </p>
<p>Many Ossho were the former territories of the Imperial Court or Imperial Family which became <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shoen.html">Shoen</a> after being donated to temples etc. Zatsueki gained from such <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shoen.html">Shoen</a> was originally collected by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kokuga (provincial government office compounds).html">Kokuga</a> together with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kanmotsu.html">Kanmotsu</a>, but in the case of Ossho, it was directly delivered to the lords of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shoen.html">Shoen</a>. It is said that this name was originally used by funin, (people who actually cultivated Ossho). However, while the lords of such <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shoen.html">Shoen</a> had the privilege to gain a pre-fixed profit even in the year of poor harvest, such pre-fixed profit was low, itto (about 18L) per tan (an area), and they didn't have shitaji-shihaiken (the right to rule the land). Under such circumstances, lords of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shoen.html">Shoen</a> strived for the establishment of ichien-shihai (complete rule over people and land of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shoen.html">Shoen</a>) in collusion with local <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Myoshu.html">myoshu</a> (owner of the rice fields). </p>
