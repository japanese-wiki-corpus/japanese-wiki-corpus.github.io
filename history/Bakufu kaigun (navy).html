<p><h3>History</h3>
</p>
<p>In order to respond to foreign ships that often came to Japan, in 1845, roju (member of shogun's council of elders), Masahiro ABE established Goyo-gakari for coastal defense (coastal defense department) to implement military reforms. However, the coastal defense measure defined that the coastal defense organization used the farmer force, which was insufficient to protest against the forces of other countries abroad. In 1853, Bakufu lifted `the ban on the production of big ships,' and encouraged each domain to produce warships. </p>
<p>After the arrival of the Black Ships, in 1854, Masahiro ABE recruited Ichio OKUBO (Ichio) to the metsuke (inspector of foot soldiers) of coastal defense department. Okubo focused on Kaishu KATSU's statement on the coastal defense.

The bakufu adopted his suggestion, and started to establish a navy. </p>

It was located within Nagasaki Bugyo West office (Sotoura-cho town, present day Edo machi-town, Nagasaki City where Nagasaki Prefectural Government is located). Naoyuki NAGAI was appointed to the supervisor for students, and among the students, Ko YATABORI, Kojiro NAGAMOCHI, Kaishu KATSU were selected as governors (supervisors for students). </p>
<p>In March 1857, Naoyuki NAGAI and other 105 students boarded `kanko maru' and left Nagasaki for Kanagawa. 
<br/>In August in the same year, they founded a warship school within Tsukiji kobusho, together with `kanko maru.'<br/>

`Yaban go' arrived in October in the same year, and 27 students in the second term from Edo boarded the `yaban go.'<br/>
Nagasaki Kaigun Denshu-sho closed in 1859. A post of gunkan bugyo (the government's naval magistrate) was newly established in the same year. </p>
<p>In January 1860, to exchange the ratification of The Treaty of Amity and Commerce between the United States and Japan, delegates to the United states boarded `bo hatan go,' the American warship (USS Powhatan [1850])to cross the Pacific. The vice-envoy, Kaishu KIMURA, Kyojyugata Toriatsukai (captain rank), Kaishu KATSU, and 11military personnel including Brook taijo (enJohn Mercer Brooke) boarded 'Kanrin maru,' and left for the United states, and they accomplished tasks such as practical training on ocean navigation by Japanese crewmen, and visit to the American Navy. <h3>Military reforms in Bunkyu Era</h3>

Later, Ikunosuke ARAI, Hamagiro HIDA, Keigo KINOSHITA (Izawa) were additionally appointed to the todori (chief) of gunkan. In July, 1862, Funategumi (a seamen's guild) was incorporated into Gunkangumi while 288 members of Kobushin-gumi (samurai without official appointments who receive small salaries) were incorporated into Gunkangumi in August in the same year. </p>
<p>In 1862, they started to construct the domestic steamboat, `Chiyodagata maru.'<br/>
Furthermore, they dispatched students to Holland, and ordered gunkan (warships) from abroad (`Fujiyama' [warship], 'Higashikan' from the United States, `Kaiyo Maru Warship' from Holland). </p>
<p>In August, 1862, a plan on the expansion of kaigun (Navy) to increase the number of warship to 370 and to increase the number of crewman to 61,205 was suggested, however, it was never adopted. <h3>Military reforms in Keio Era</h3>
