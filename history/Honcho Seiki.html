<h1>Honcho Seiki (本朝世紀)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Honcho Seiki refers to the history book compiled during the late Heian period. </p>
<p>It was compiled by FUJIWARA no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shinzei.html">Shinzei</a> as a history book that continued the legacy of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Rikkokushi (the Six National Histories).html">Rikkokushi</a> (the Six National Histories), upon the imperial order by the Retired <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Toba.html">Emperor Toba</a> (1103-1156, reigned as an emperor: 1107-1123). It was compiled between 1150 and 1159. It is also referred to as "Shikanki" and "Gekinikki." The series consists of 20 volumes in total. </p>
<p>The book continues on "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Nihon Sandai Jitsuroku.html">Nihon Sandai Jitsuroku</a>" (Veritable Records of Three Reigns of Japan), and it covers from the time of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Uda.html">Emperor Uda</a> (from 877) to the time of Emperor Konoe (reigned: 1141-1155). In the book, the original texts of the diaries and family trees of notable families were compiled following the chronological order. Since <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shinzei.html">Shinzei</a> died during the Heiji War in 1159, the book was left unfinished, and moreover, a large part of it was scattered and lost. The existing documents belong to a part that records the years between 935 and 1153, and are considered important historical documents of the period. </p>
