<h1>The Yoshino Pact (a pact concluded with Emperor Tenmu and Empress Jito about the enthronement of Prince Kusakabe) (吉野の盟約)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The Yoshino pact was concluded by Emperor Tenmu and his empress who was later known as Empress Jito promising their son, Prince Kusakabe, to be the next emperor. 
<br/>The Yoshino pact was also known as 'the Oath in Yoshino.'<br/>
</p>
<p>Gyoko (Imperial visit) to Yoshino was carried out on June 21, 679. Members of the Imperial family including the Prince Kusakabe were sworn to accept that Prince Kusakabe would become the next emperor, to help him and to avoid any conflicts with one another. Prince Shiki, a member of the Imperial family, was the seventh prince of Emperor Tenchi who was the older brother of Prince Kusakabe, and never appeared in any records prior to the Yoshino Pact. </p>
<p>At the time when Kusakabe became the Crown Prince in 681, Prince Otsu, a capable rival, became involved in the politics of the region; thus, the successor of Emperor Tenmu became uncertain. Meanwhile, the Emperor died and Prince Otsu met unfortunate end on suspicion of a rebellion. Prince Kusakabe also died young around the same time and Uno no Sarara ignored other rightful successors such as the Prince Takechi and officially enthroned herself to be Emperor Jito. </p>
