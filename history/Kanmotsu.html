<h1>Kanmotsu (官物)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kanmotsu are the tithes that were collected by the imperial court and Ryoseikoku (province) as tax such as Soyocho under the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ritsuryo.html">Ritsuryo</a> system (a system of centralized government based on the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ritsuryo.html">ritsuryo</a> code). In some cases it is a term restricted to So. After the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ritsuryo.html">Ritsuryo</a> system deteriorated in the middle of the Heian Period, it was the term to describe the tithes from public fields such as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Koden.html">Koden</a> (field administered directly by a ruler). 
<br/>The Japanese reading is 'Ohoyakemono.'<br/>
</p>
<p>Originally Kanmotsu is thought to have been the term for Denso (rice field tax), a property tax, but after the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ritsuryo.html">Ritsuryo</a> system was established, 'Kanmotsu' became the term to describe tithes such as Soyocho and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Suiko.html">suiko</a> (government loans), <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shozei (the rice tax stored in provincial offices warehouse).html">shozei</a> (the rice tax stored in a provincial office's warehouse) and its use and accumulated products. </p>
<p>With the deterioration of the Soyocho system, per capita taxes such as yo and cho were not enforced. Instead, a property tax-like Kanmotsu consisting of Denso and Jishimai (rice paid as rent), and per capita tax, Zatsueki (and a variation, temporary Zatsueki) were collected. Eventually, Zatsueki became like a property tax as well. However, in the tenth century, the collection standards for Kanmotsu were still decided by the Kokurei (provincial law) in each <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ritsuryo.html">Ritsuryo</a> province and it was collected in the form of rice grain (kanto [rice grain owned by the government]) and rice (kanmai [rice owned by the government]), silk, and cloth, but in actuality was decided by each <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kokushi.html">Kokushi</a> (officer in local government). However, as a result, Kanmotsu more than that decided in the Kokurei was collected. This was called Kanmotsu kacho and the rice collected by this system was called Kacho-mai. However, conflicts between <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kokushi.html">Kokushi</a> and the local farmers over Kacho became serious, and in the middle of the eleventh century, Kanmotsu and Zatsumotsu were collected following a certain standard (Kanmotsu rippo) and other temporary taxation was called Rinjizatsumotsu. </p>
<p>In the twelfth century, in place of the previous Kanmotsu rippo, public taxes called Ikkoku heikinyaku (taxes and labor uniformly imposed on <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> manors and provincial lands) and Gokeninnyaku (odd-jobs for vassals) were collected from not only <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kokuga (provincial government office compounds).html">Kokuga</a> owned public fields but also <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shoen.html">Shoen</a>, and the tithes from these taxes were also called Kanmotsu and this term was used until the period of the Northern and Southern Courts (Japan). </p>
