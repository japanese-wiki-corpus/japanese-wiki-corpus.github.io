<h1>Nairaishi (内礼司)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Nairaishi (Palace Etiquette Office) was one of the institutions belonging to Nakatsukasasho (Ministry of Central Affairs) in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ritsuryo.html">Ritsuryo</a> system (a system of centralized government based on the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ritsuryo.html">ritsuryo</a> code) in Japan. </p>
<p><h3>Official duties</h3>
</p>
<p>Nairaishi corrected the manner in the Imperial Court and prosecuted the breaking of the law as its official duty. To prosecute the breaking, six members of shurai was put as tomo no miyatsuko (Servant of the Court administering a group). Shurai was the nearest post to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Honkan.html">honkan</a> among tomo no miyatsuko. If the law was broken, the exposure was reported to the related institutions through Nakatsukasasho. (Sodan) It was a kind of special force police unit in the Imperial Court, but as for jurisdiction, it just judged a misdemeanor in the organization as well as the other institutions. There was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Danjodai (Board of Censors).html">Danjodai</a> (Board of Censors) as a similar institution, but it prosecuted outside of the Imperial Court.
