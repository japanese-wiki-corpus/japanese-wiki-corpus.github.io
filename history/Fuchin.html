<h1>Fuchin (風鎮)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Fuchin is a weight put on the tip of a roller of kakejiku (hanging scroll). It is used to prevent swinging of kakejiku in a literal sense as well as 'to quell wind' and it has a strong sense of ornament. Tassels are put through a hollow ceramic, then those are put on both ends of the roller. </p>
<p>The spindle is made of pottery, porcelain and also agate, crystal and ebony. In particular, the original function of fuchin is being lost due to recent airtight houses, thus synthetic resin is used for producing a fuchin to prevent damage of kakejiku due to the weight. A special box made of paulownia tree is often attached to the expensive ones and the box is used to store fuchin when it is not used. </p>
