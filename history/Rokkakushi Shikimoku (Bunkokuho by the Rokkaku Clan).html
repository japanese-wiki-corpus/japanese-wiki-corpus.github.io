<h1>Rokkakushi <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shikimoku.html">Shikimoku</a> (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bunkokuho.html">Bunkokuho</a> by the Rokkaku Clan) (六角氏式目)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Rokkakushi <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shikimoku.html">Shikimoku</a> was one of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bunkokuho.html">bunkokuho</a> (the law individual sengoku-daimyo enforced in their own domain) in the Sengoku period. Rokkakushi <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shikimoku.html">Shikimoku</a> was established by the Rokkaku clan in the Minami <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Omi Province.html">Omi Province</a>. It is also known as Yoshiharu <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shikimoku.html">Shikimoku</a>. There were 67 articles in total. </p>
<p>Rokkakushi <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shikimoku.html">Shikimoku</a> was established in 1567. Rokkakushi <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shikimoku.html">Shikimoku</a> was established when the Rokkaku clan lost their authority despite their intention to increase their power because of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kannonji family feud.html">Kannonji family feud</a> which broke out in 1563. Under the diminishing authority of the Rokkaku clan, Rokkakushi <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shikimoku.html">Shikimoku</a> was established after <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Sadahide GAMO.html">Sadahide GAMO</a> and other major vassals drafted the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shikimoku.html">shikimoku</a> (law codes in the itemized form, which were used in the medieval Japan) and Yoshikata ROKKAKU and Yoshisuke ROKKAKU, father and son, approved it. Also, the agreement to swear the strict observance of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shikimoku.html">shikimoku</a> was exchanged between Shotei and Yoshisuke, father and son, and 20 vassals. </p>
<p>Unlike other <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bunkokuho.html">bunkokuho</a>, Rokkakushi <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shikimoku.html">Shikimoku</a> restricted the authority of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> (Japanese feudal lords). This indicates the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kokujin.html">Kokujin</a> formation's strong sense of independence in the Kinai region (the five capital provinces surrounding the ancient capitals of Nara and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>). </p>
<p>Also, the 67 articles of Rokkakushi <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shikimoku.html">Shikimoku</a> mainly concerned the regulations over civil affairs. As a rule, common laws of a local land were respected; however, Rokkakushi <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shikimoku.html">Shikimoku</a> established the way to promote solidarity of a feudal lord. Rokkakushi <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shikimoku.html">Shikimoku</a> restricted an arbitrary deprivation of people under a domain by a feudal lord; at the same time, it also prohibited actions such as organized looting by village people against their feudal lord. </p>
