<p>Kunikyo (also called Kuni no miya) was a place in Soraku District, Yamashiro Province that was designated as a capital for a period of time during the Nara period. It is located in what is now Kizukawa City, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>. It is also referred to as "<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Yamato.html">Yamato</a> no kuni no <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Omiya (The Tale of Genji).html">omiya</a>." </p>
<p>Although it was designated as a national historical site of the remains of the Yamashiro <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Kokubun-ji Temple (Kashihara City).html">Kokubun-ji Temple</a> since July 1, 1957, the change of the place name as Kuni no miya ato/ Kunikyu seki (the remains of Kunikyo) (the remains of the Yamashiro <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Kokubun-ji Temple (Kashihara City).html">Kokubun-ji Temple</a>) was requested at the Council for Cultural Affairs on November 17, 2006, and the new name was announced through the official gazette on February 6, 2007. As a result, the area designated a historic site was also expanded. </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>After the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Rebellion of FUJIWARA no Hirotsugu.html">Rebellion of FUJIWARA no Hirotsugu</a>, the capital was transferred from Heijokyo to Kunikyo by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Shomu.html">Emperor Shomu</a> on January 10, 741. It is said that the reason why Soraku was chosen as a place for the capital was that it was the stronghold of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/TACHIBANA no Moroe.html">TACHIBANA no Moroe</a>, who was <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Sadaijin (Minister of the Left).html">Sadaijin</a> (the Minister of the Left). </p>
<p>In September 741, the areas for Sakyo (Left Capital) and Ukyo (Right Capital) were designated, and in November of the same year, the official name '<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Yamato.html">Yamato</a> no kuni no <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Omiya (The Tale of Genji).html">omiya</a>' was decided upon and the Palace was built. Kunikyo did not see the light of day as a capital, because the construction project was called off at the end of 743 and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Shomu.html">Emperor Shomu</a> moved to Shigaraki no Miya Palace. The capital was then moved to Naniwa-kyo in 744, and finally moved back to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Heijo-kyo.html">Heijo-kyo</a> in 745. </p>
<p>Although Kunikyo was a capital for only about three years, the Imperial Decree for the Construction of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Kokubun-ji Temple (Kashihara City).html">Kokubun-ji Temple</a> and Kokubun-niji Temple and the Imperial Decree for the Construction of the Great Buddha, both significant events in Japanese cultural history, were issued and carried out at this place. <h3>Yamashiro <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Kokubun-ji Temple (Kashihara City).html">Kokubun-ji Temple</a></h3>
</p>
<p>After the capital was moved away from Kunikyo, the remains of the palaces were utilized for building Yamashiro <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Kokubun-ji Temple (Kashihara City).html">Kokubun-ji Temple</a>. The building of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Daigokuden.html">Daigokuden</a> was used as Kon-do or the Golden Hall. </p>
<p>The temple occupied a large area of three blocks in the north-south direction (about 330 m) and two and a half blocks in the east-west direction (about 275 m). On the east side of Kon-do was the grounds of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Goryo-jinja Shrine (Fukuchiyama City).html">Goryo-jinja Shrine</a> (in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamo-cho (Kyoto Prefecture).html">Kamo-cho</a>), a Chinju-sha Shrine (a protecting shrine) of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Kokubun-ji Temple (Kashihara City).html">Kokubun-ji Temple</a>. </p>
<p>The place is now a vast field, and the foundation stones of Kon-do/<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Daigokuden.html">Daigokuden</a> and Nanajunoto (Seven-story pagoda) remain on the grounds. <h3>Access</h3>
