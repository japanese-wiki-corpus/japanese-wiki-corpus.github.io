<h1>Japanese Race (日本民族)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The term "Japanese race" expresses a notion of a political community (nation) which embodies all cultural groups (ethnic groups) that possess a Japanese nationality and/or roots in the Japanese archipelago. In addition to the the Yamato race, the ethnic minorities such as Aynu, Uilta, and Nivkh are included. </p>
<p>However, the term "nation" is used differently between Japanese and English. In a broad sense, the term "Japanese" is commonly and ambiguously used to mean "belonging to Japan" or "having a Japanese nationality". 
<br/>(Also refer to Race.)<br/>
</p>
<p>Terms such as the "Soviet race" or the "Chinese race", which were employed by multiethnic states in the communist bloc such as the former Soviet Union and the People's Republic of China with an intention of suppressing the separatism in order to maintain the tight political integration, are translated into Japanese using the term "minzoku" which means race. </p>
<p>The term is also used to refer to the Yamato race alone. </p>
