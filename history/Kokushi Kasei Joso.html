<h1>Kokushi Kasei Joso (国司苛政上訴)</h1>
<p></p>
<p><a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Kokushi.html">Kokushi</a> kasei joso refers to acts and phenomena of appeals and armed struggles by <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Gunji.html">Gunji</a> (local magistrates), Tato (cultivators), <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Fumyo.html">Fumyo</a> (tiller of the public rice field), and the farmer class in order to complain to the central government Daijokan (Grand Council of State) about tyrannies and illegal behaviors of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Kokushi.html">Kokushi</a> (or <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Zuryo (The Head of The Provincial Governors).html">Zuryo</a>) (provincial governors), Chihokan (local officials) during the Heian period in Japan. It is also called <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Kokushi.html">kokushi</a> kasei <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Shuso.html">shuso</a>. <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Gunji.html">Gunji</a> or farmers of provinces commonly visited the capital to complain to the Daijokan about tyrannies and illegal behaviors of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Kokushi.html">Kokushi</a> in front of Yomei-mon gate (the public gate of the Imperial Palace) of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Daidairi.html">Daidairi</a> (the Greater Imperial Palace). It started to appear in the second half of the 10th century and often occurred particularly when <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/FUJIWARA no Michinaga.html">FUJIWARA no Michinaga</a> was an administrator. However it became increasingly nominal, ending in the 1040's. </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>The first historical record of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Kokushi.html">Kokushi</a> kasei joso was a case in which farmers in Owari Province complained to Daijokan about illegal behaviors of their <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Kokushu.html">kokushu</a>, FUJIWARA no Tsurasada in 974. Originally under the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Ritsuryo.html">Ritsuryo</a> codes, farmers had a right of action but were prohibited from bringing a case without going through formalities (a direct appeal to a senior official). It is not unknown why <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Kokushi.html">Kokushi</a> kasei joso, apparently a form of direct appeals, began to be accepted. However, some have suggested it was accepted as a compromise measure against <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Zuryo (The Head of The Provincial Governors).html">Zuryo</a>'s growing control over entire Japan, while others have suggested that the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Gunji.html">Gunji</a> class (local magistrates) was given the right to direct appeals in exchange for their lost conventional rights. </p>
<p>Since the first case, the number of appeals only found in historical documents rose to more than twenty over about sixty years until the 1140's. One of the most famous appeals was 'Owari no kuni (Owari Province) <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Gunji.html">Gunji</a> (a local government official) <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Hyakusho.html">Hyakusho</a> (farmers) ra no Gebumi (letter)' of November 8, 988, in which the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Gunji.html">Gunji</a> and farmers in Owari complained their <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Kokushu.html">Kokushu</a>, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/FUJIWARA no Motonaga.html">FUJIWARA no Motonaga</a>'s illegal behaviors as a breach of thirty-one articles of misconduct and violence. As the result, Motonaga was dismissed of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Kokushi.html">Kokushi</a>. </p>
<p>Initially as described above, it was common that Daijokan approved claims of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Gunji.html">gunji</a> and farmers and dismissed the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Kokushi.html">kokushi</a>. However Daijokan headed by <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/FUJIWARA no Michinaga.html">FUJIWARA no Michinaga</a> became aware that some claims of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Gunji.html">Gunji</a> and farmers are rather selfish and thus claims that won dismissal of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Kokushu.html">Kokushu</a> dramatically dropped from about 50% to 20% during the period between the latter half of the 1110's and the 1120's. Eventually <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Kokushi.html">Kokushi</a> kasei joso became rare after claims in the 1140's. <h3>Evaluation</h3>
</p>
<p>Before the war (before the 1940's) the Heian period was interpreted as a period when dynasty government was becoming a mere shell or dead letter and local government was devastating. <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Kokushi.html">Kokushi</a> kasei joso was also commonly regarded as evidence of disrupting local governments with Juryoso (career provincial official class) seeking only for their own interests. </p>
<p>After the war fundamentally different evolutions were given to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Kokushi.html">Kokushi</a> kasei joso based on the dynastic polity theory. Around the former half of the 10th century, the rule over people under the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Ritsuryo.html">Ritsuryo</a> system was destructed in which people and farmers were controlled with family register and keicho (the yearly tax registers). To ensure yields of tax, the Imperial Court introduced a new ruling system where <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Kokugaryo.html">Kokugaryo</a> (territories governed by provincial government office) in provinces were divided into units of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Myoden.html">myoden</a> (rice field lots in charge of nominal holders) so that land lords of the wealthy class (Tato (cultivators)) undertook the management of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Myoden.html">myoden</a> and land tax payment. This system is called the local tax manager system, which constitutes a foundation of the system of the dynasty state as a regime. In response to this shift of the system, the administration of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Kokushi.html">Kokushi</a> (provincial governors) was required only to pay certain taxes (such as <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Kanmotsu.html">kanmotsu</a> (tribute goods paid as taxes or tithes) and zatsueki (odd-job tasks)) with other tasks left to the discretion of the appointed head of the provincial governors. Such <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Kokushi.html">Kokushi</a> is <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Zuryo (The Head of The Provincial Governors).html">Zuryo</a> (the head of the provincial governors). The <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Zuryo (The Head of The Provincial Governors).html">Zuryo</a> was entitled to control over his own province at their own discretion, allowing them to collect taxes strictly from <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Gunji.html">Gunji</a> (local magistrates), Tato, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Fumyo.html">Fumyo</a> (tiller of the public rice field), and farmers. <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Gunji.html">Gunji</a> and farmers who were opposed to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Zuryo (The Head of The Provincial Governors).html">Zuryo</a> appealed <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Kokushi.html">Kokushi</a> kasei joso as a class struggle. <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Kokushi.html">Kokushi</a> kasei joso was effective in having an effect on Daijokan's policies, resulting in the enactment of "<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Koden.html">Koden</a> <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Kanmotsu.html">kanmotsu</a> rippo" (fixing a limit of 3 to of rice per tan of land) in 1040 for fixing the tax rates in Japan. Therefore the post-war evaluation is that the disappearance of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Kokushi.html">Kokushi</a> kasei joso was because <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Zuryo (The Head of The Provincial Governors).html">Zuryo</a>'s arbitrary administration had been controlled. </p>
<p>Some have opinions different from above; Juryoso (career provincial official class) in those days did not necessarily suppress <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Gunji.html">Gunji</a> and farmers to pursue their own self-interest. Examining individual cases of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Kokushi.html">Kokushi</a> kasei joso, we can find law-abiding administrative stances of the sued <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Kokushi.html">Kokushi</a>; some legally levied tax items not collected by customs or others levied local taxes, often collected in those days under a new system by the change of the emperors. Although <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/FUJIWARA no Motonaga.html">FUJIWARA no Motonaga</a> had been often regarded as a greedy <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Zuryo (The Head of The Provincial Governors).html">Zuryo</a>, some suggest that Motonaga only observed strictly the policy of Kazan <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Shinsei (Law reconstitution).html">shinsei</a> (new laws issued by Emperor Kazan) under the new local tax system Emperor Kazan actively introduced immediately after his enthronement. These views have brought about an opinion that a contradiction intrinsic to the local tax manager system appeared in the form of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Kokushi.html">Kokushi</a> kasei joso. In fact, rather selfish desires of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Gunji.html">Gunji</a> and farmers can be seen in some cases: for example, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Kokushi.html">Kokushi</a> kasei joso was a revenge by <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Zaichokanjin.html">zaichokanjin</a> (the local officials in Heian and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> periods) who had an argument with Nagato no kuni no kami (governor of Nagato Province); farmers submitted a letter to praise their <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/railway/Tanba (train).html">Tanba</a> no kuni no kami immediately after <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Kokushi.html">Kokushi</a> kasei joso; and appealing farmers set fire to the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Kokushi.html">kokushi</a>'s residence in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. In this opinion, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Kokushi.html">Kokushi</a> kasei joso disappeared because <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Gunji.html">Gunji</a> and farmers became involved in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Kokuga (provincial government office compounds).html">Kokuga</a> government as <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Zaichokanjin.html">Zaichokanjin</a> (the local officials in Heian and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> periods). </p>
<p>In addition, officials in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Kokuga (provincial government office compounds).html">kokuga</a> (provincial government offices) and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Gunji.html">Gunji</a> began to be collectively called Zoshikinin (lower-level functionaries in the provincial government) in the latter half the 10th century. In other opinions, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Kokushi.html">Kokushi</a> kasei joso appeared as the evidence that these Zoshikinin worked with local influential persons to counter the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Kokushi.html">Kokushi</a> and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Zuryo (The Head of The Provincial Governors).html">Zuryo</a> class. </p>
<p>In evaluating these historical events, we should keep in mind that the farmer class refers not to poor farmers suffering from heavy taxes <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Zuryo (The Head of The Provincial Governors).html">Zuryo</a> collected but to large-scale managers of agriculture and other industries who had vested rights in the local community and industries with many subordinate people and private solders and had a contract with <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Kokuga (provincial government office compounds).html">kokuga</a> over <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Fumyo.html">fumyo</a>. No matter what evaluations are given to these conflicts, it is clear that the mechanism of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Kokuga (provincial government office compounds).html">Kokuga</a> (provincial government offices) headed by <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Zuryo (The Head of The Provincial Governors).html">Zuryo</a> helped such a wealthy farmer class grow to control the region and collect taxes more efficiently and gave them opportunities of acquiring huge vested interests. These conflicts were brought about by severe competition for wealth between <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Zuryo (The Head of The Provincial Governors).html">Zuryo</a> who took responsibility in the local governance and tax collection and the wealthy farmer class who were gathering wealth. For more details, see sections of Tato and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Fumyo.html">Fumyo</a>, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Zuryo (The Head of The Provincial Governors).html">Zuryo</a>, farmers and warriors. </p>
