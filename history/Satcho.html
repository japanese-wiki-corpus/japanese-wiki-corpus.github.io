<h1>Satcho (薩長)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Satcho is an abbreviation of the Satsuma Domain and the Choshu Domain. The Satsuma Domain and the Choshu Domain had been in conflict with each other, but an intermediation by Ryoma SAKAMOTO led to the Satsuma-Choshu Alliance. A majority of the officers in important posts in the new Meiji Government and the armed forces came from Satcho. </p>
