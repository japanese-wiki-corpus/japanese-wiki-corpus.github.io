<p>Yoriudo (Yoryudo) was a term used during the middle ages after the Heian period for certain people, but had multiple meanings. </p>

<ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:block" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6625151359627561" data-ad-slot="2955832603" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins>

<p><h3>Kuge (court nobles) government</h3>
</p>
<p>It indicates the staff that worked in Kanga (government office) of the Imperial Court such as Wakadokoro (office of waka), Goshodokoro (office to maintain books in the Imperial Court), Kirokujo (land record office), Infumidono (the retired emperor's documents bureau), Goin and so on. In the case of Wakadokoro, they were also called meshiudo. Officials with administrative ability in general affairs and management were selected (in the case of Wakadokoro, ability to write and select waka poems was important). </p>
<p>The number of personnel was about 10 to 20 and in many cases were sent or jointly appointed from other governmental offices. "Ruiju <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Meibutsu (in this case, good tea utensils).html">meibutsu</a> ko" (an encyclopedia compiled by Matsuake YAMAOKA during the middle of the Edo period) suggests that the origin of the word came from calling people who 'came to gather' at governmental offices yoriudo, but the actual origin is unknown. <h3>Military government</h3>
</p>
<p>It indicates the staff that worked at <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>) organizations such as Kumonjo (administration office), <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Mandokoro.html">Mandokoro</a> (administrative board), <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Monchujo.html">Monchujo</a> (court of justice), and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Samuraidokoro.html">Samuraidokoro</a> (board of retainers). Also called kunin. Because it was necessary to record and prepare documents, experienced staff such as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Yuhitsu.html">yuhitsu</a> (amanuensis) were appointed, and officers such as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shitsuji.html">Shitsuji</a> (steward), Shitsujidai (deputy steward), Shoshiidai (representative of shoshi, a governor of the board of retainers) and Kaigo (assistant administrator) were often selected from yoriudo/kunin. <h3><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shoen.html">Shoen</a> (private manor)</h3>
</p>
<p>It indicates the people who worked for the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> landlord (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Honke.html">honke</a> [the head family]) under a special agreement within the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> during the Heian period. However, the meaning differed depending upon the time period. </p>
<p>Originally, it was thought to indicate the landless or exiles who escaped into <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> and became enslaved. Yoriudo was used to indicated the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shomin.html">shomin</a> (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> people) who were exempt from temporary <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Zoyaku.html">zoyaku</a> (odd-jobs task) taxed by the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kokuga (provincial government office compounds).html">Kokuga</a> (provincial government offices) from the middle of the 10th century. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shomin.html">Shomin</a> who were not exempt as well as koryo (public land) farmers were called komin (public people). However, in later years, some komin had a multiple vassal relationship by farming a part of a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> that had temporary <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Zoyaku.html">zoyaku</a> exemption rights and belonged there as a yoriudo as well and tried to be exempt from temporary <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Zoyaku.html">zoyaku</a> for their main farm lands as well. Some <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> landowners accepted such people and used this to try and make the farm land (koryo and other <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> farm lands) that they farmed their own property. This situation led to not only the reduction of koryo but also became a factor for boundary disputes between <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a>, therefore yoriudo were regulated again and again by Manor Regulation Acts. </p>
<p>After the middle of the 11th century, together with the expansion of Funyu rights (Japan), Ichien shihai (reigning of whole regions) became established and all those who lived within a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> were under the rule of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> landowner as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shomin.html">shomin</a>. Therefore, the difference within the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> between komin and yoriudo such as whether they were exempt from temporary <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Zoyaku.html">zoyaku</a> disappeared in actuality and the term <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shomin.html">shomin</a> was used subsequently. <h3>Merchants and craftsmen</h3>
</p>
<p>As with <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a>, among merchants and craftsmen, people who belonged to a specific power structure and received protection were called yoriudo, similar to the yoriudo of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a>. Jinin (associates of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> shrines), <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kugonin.html">Kugonin</a> (purveyors to the imperial household), and Sanjozoshiki (low-level functionary) were examples of this. Due to the characteristics of their occupation, some would belong to a power structure other than that related with their living area or became yoriudo of various power structures. It is suggested that the establishment of Za in the middle ages may also have been influenced by yoriudo groups. </p>
