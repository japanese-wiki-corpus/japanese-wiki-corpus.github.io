<h1>In no Kinshin (the retired Emperor's courtier) (院近臣)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>In no Kinshin refers to the close associates or the group of close associates of Chiten no kimi (the retired emperor in power) who carried out Insei (rule by the retired emperor.)<br/>
</p>
<p>Many of them were blood relatives of menoto (wet nurses) who served Chiten no kimi, or middle-class nobles who formerly served as Kokushi (also called Zuryo; provincial governors.)<br/>
They often took reins of power instead of the Sekkan-ke (the families which produced regents). However, as times went by, strife over authority arose among In no Kinshin, which was one of the causes of the Heiji War in 1159. </p>
<p>After the mid Kamakura period when the promotion of benevolent rule became a subject of the Insei, practical middle rank nobles with full knowledge of laws, court rules, ceremony and decorums were often appointed as In no Kinshin. </p>
