<h1>Kokumin Domeikai (People's Alliance Society) (国民同盟会)</h1>
<p></p>

<p>The society pressed the government to take forceful measures sensing a danger from Russia which expanded into Manchuria after the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Boxer Rebellion.html">Boxer Rebellion</a>. The society, however, dissolved in April, 1902, after successful negotiations led to the return of Manchuria to China and the Anglo-Japanese Alliance was formed, which calmed down the sense of danger among the public. Later, however, Russia failed to withdraw from Manchuria and KONOE and his group formed a new organization called 'Tairodoshikai (Comrades against Russia)'. </p>
