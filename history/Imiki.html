<h1>Imiki (忌寸)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Imiki was one of the kabane (hereditary titles) established by Yakusa no Kabane (the eight hereditary titles) in 684, and it was placed as the fourth rank. Imiki was given to the Kuninomiyatsuko (the heads of local governments) who already had the title of Atae or clans whose ancestors are toraijin (people from overseas, especially from China and Korea, who settled in early Japan and introduced Continental culture to the Japanese). </p>
