<h1>Zatsumusata (雑務沙汰)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Zatsumusata is a term that was used in medieval Japan, referring to civil dispute, suit, and trial except for territory and land tax. </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>Zatsumu literally means 'miscellaneous business' and was used in contrast to Shomu (see shomusata (trial dealing with land-related issues) for reference). Zatsumusata included loan and personal property suits, such as, money loan, sales contract or longtime disposal of farmland or others, and slave trading. <h3>Kamakura bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun)</h3>
</p>
<p>In the Kamakura bakufu, monchujo (a court of justice) in Togoku (the eastern part of Japan, particularly the Kanto region) and mandokoro (Administrative Board) in Kamakura City held jurisdiction over Zatsumusata. </p>
