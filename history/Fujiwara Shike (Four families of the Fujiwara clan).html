<h1>Fujiwara <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Shike (teaching master).html">Shike</a> (Four families of the Fujiwara clan) (藤原四家)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Fujiwara <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Shike (teaching master).html">Shike</a>, also called four families of the Fujiwara clan, means the four family lines founded by four sons of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Fuhito.html">FUJIWARA no Fuhito</a>. </p>
<p><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/family/Fujiwara Nanke (Fujiwara Nan Family).html">Fujiwara Nanke</a> (the Southern House of the Fujiwara clan): Founded by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Muchimaro.html">FUJIWARA no Muchimaro</a> (680-737). Fujiwara Hokke (the Northern House of the Fujiwara clan): Founded by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Fusasaki.html">FUJIWARA no Fusasaki</a> (681-737). <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Fujiwara Shikike (the Ceremonial House of the Fujiwara clan).html">Fujiwara Shikike</a>: Founded by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Umakai.html">FUJIWARA no Umakai</a> (ca. 694 - 737). <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Fujiwara Kyoke (the Capital House of the Fujiwara clan).html">Fujiwara Kyoke</a> (the Western House of the Fujiwara clan): Founded by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/FUJIWARA no Maro.html">FUJIWARA no Maro</a> (695 - 737). </p>
<p>Since FUJIWARA is a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kabane (hereditary title).html">kabane</a> (hereditary title), and not a family name nor a last name, there was no 'Fujiwara-ke' (Fujiwara family) among court nobles before the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period. Fujiwara <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Shike (teaching master).html">Shike</a> does not mean Fujiwara family, but a wholesome name of four family lines: 'Nanke,' 'Hokke,' 'Shikike,' and 'Kyoke' of the Fujiwara clan. </p>
