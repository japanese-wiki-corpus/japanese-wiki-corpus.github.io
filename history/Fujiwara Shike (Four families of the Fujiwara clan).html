<h1>Fujiwara Shike (Four families of the Fujiwara clan) (藤原四家)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Fujiwara Shike, also called four families of the Fujiwara clan, means the four family lines founded by four sons of FUJIWARA no Fuhito. </p>
<p>Fujiwara Nanke (the Southern House of the Fujiwara clan): Founded by FUJIWARA no Muchimaro (680-737). Fujiwara Hokke (the Northern House of the Fujiwara clan): Founded by FUJIWARA no Fusasaki (681-737). Fujiwara Shikike: Founded by FUJIWARA no Umakai (ca. 694 - 737). Fujiwara Kyoke (the Western House of the Fujiwara clan): Founded by FUJIWARA no Maro (695 - 737). </p>
<p>Since FUJIWARA is a kabane (hereditary title), and not a family name nor a last name, there was no 'Fujiwara-ke' (Fujiwara family) among court nobles before the Meiji period. Fujiwara Shike does not mean Fujiwara family, but a wholesome name of four family lines: 'Nanke,' 'Hokke,' 'Shikike,' and 'Kyoke' of the Fujiwara clan. </p>
