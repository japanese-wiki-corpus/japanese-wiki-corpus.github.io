<h1>Konin-shiki (Supplementary laws) (弘仁式)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The Konin-shiki was a compilation of laws that were compiled and enforced from the early Heian Period. It was a total of 40 volumes. </p>
<p><h3>The compilation process</h3>
</p>
<p>The idea of compiling the various laws had been explored since the time of Emperor Kanmu, but only began during the rein of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Saga.html">Emperor Saga</a> when a "<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Kyakushiki.html">Kyakushiki</a> (law) compilation office" was established. The compilation project was formally launched with <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/FUJIWARA no Fuyutsugu.html">FUJIWARA no Fuyutsugu</a> as a president, and responsibilities distributed between <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/FUJIWARA no Kadonomaro.html">FUJIWARA no Kadonomaro</a>, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/AKISHINO no Yasuhito.html">AKISHINO no Yasuhito</a>, FUJIWARA no Mimori, TACHIBANA no Tsunenushi, and OKIHARA no Miniku. </p>
<p>On June 9, 820, both the Konin-kyaku Code and the Konin-shiki Code were submitted. After revisions and corrections were made to it, it was resubmitted 10 years later on October 30, 830, and put into effect on December 9 of the same year. As flaws were found in the finalized edition, it was amended and the revised version was distributed on May 28, 840 under the new title, "Kaisei Irohibyu <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Kyakushiki.html">Kyakushiki</a>" (Revised and improved edition of the law). The existing copies of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Konin-Kyaku.html">Konin-Kyaku</a> and Konin-Shiki are believed to be from after the final revision. <h3>The contents</h3>
</p>
<p>Regulations and codes were created by either the Grand or government officials and included such laws as the "Hachijyu-hachi-rei" (the 88 Regulations), the "Shikibu-sho-rei" (regulations for the Ministry of Ceremonies), and "Minbu-sho-shiki" (codes for the Ministry of Popular Affairs). The codes and their precedents were gathered and chosen from, then filed by the appropriate official. If a suitable official could not be found, the document would be included in the miscellaneous section at the end of the volume. Even after the "Jogan-shiki code" was established, the "Konin-shiki Code" was still referred to for matters that were not specified in the "Jogan-shiki", and it was the source of much confusion. A unified "Engi-shiki" was created, and the "Konin-shiki" and "Jogan-shiki" were discarded. </p>
<p>The original "Konin-shiki" volumes were since lost, but some of it's texts were on the back of the pages in the Kujo family's copy of the "Engi-shiki" (which was declared a national treasure and is currently stored at the Tokyo National Museum). Only fragments from the second part of the "<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Shikibu-sho.html">Shikibu-sho</a>" (the Ministry of Ceremonial) in Volume 19, and the first part of the "<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Shuzeiryo (Bureau of Taxation).html">Shuzeiryo</a>" (Bureau of Taxation) in volume 25 remain, along with quotations mentioned in various books. There is a 30 volume set that claims to be a copy of the original, but which is actually a fake. </p>
