<h1>Doyoso (public repository to store rice tax, which were allowed to be consumed, in ancient <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ritsuryo.html">ritsuryo</a> system) (動用倉)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Doyoso is a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Shoso (public repository).html">shoso</a> (public repository) to store doyo, which was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shozei (the rice tax stored in provincial offices warehouse).html">shozei</a> (rice tax) allowed to be consumed, in ancient ritsuryosei (system of centralized governance). It is also called doso. Originally it was a notion coupled with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Fudoso (a warehouse sealed after being examined of its degree of sealing).html">fudoso</a> (public repository to store rice tax, which was not allowed to be consumed without a permission of Daijokan, Grand Council of State). </p>
<p>In 708, when the system of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Fudokoku (rice tax stored in a warehouse called fudoso).html">fudokoku</a> (staples for an emergency, stored in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Fudoso (a warehouse sealed after being examined of its degree of sealing).html">fudoso</a>) was introduced, the opposite idea of 'doyo' was also introduced. Rice in husk collected through Soyocho tax system and placed in a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Shoso (public repository).html">shoso</a> of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kokuga (provincial government office compounds).html">kokuga</a> (provincial government office compounds) became <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Fudokoku (rice tax stored in a warehouse called fudoso).html">fudokoku</a> after inspection and sealing when the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Shoso (public repository).html">shoso</a> was filled, while the rice in husk before inspection and sealing was used in case of emergency, like almsgiving, according to the judgement of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kokushi.html">kokushi</a> (an officer of a province). This is called doyo (there were also doyo of millet and sake according to existing <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shozei (the rice tax stored in provincial offices warehouse).html">shozei</a> records, and therefore, doyo of rice in husk is especially called 'doyokoku'). Doyoso was a warehouse to place such doyo. </p>
<p>A key of doyoso was called <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Jokan.html">jokan</a> and controlled under <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kokushi.html">kokushi</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Gunji.html">gunji</a> (officer of a county). </p>
