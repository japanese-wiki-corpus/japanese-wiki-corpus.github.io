<h1>Shugouke (守護請)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Shugouke is a system during the Muromachi period in Japan under which <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a> (provincial constable) undertook to pay the land tax on <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> (Manor in medieval Japan) and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Kokugaryo.html">Kokugaryo</a> (territories governed by provincial government office) (koryo (an Imperial demesne)) for the lord of the manor and chigyo-kokushu (provincial proprietor). It is a form of ukedokoro (land lease contract system). In the Muromachi period, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a> strengthened the control over <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Kokugaryo.html">Kokugaryo</a> in the country through Shugouke. </p>
<p><h3>History</h3>
</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> started to make inroads into <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> and koryo, expanding their involvement over time. Lord of the manor and chigyo-kokushu introduced Jitouke (the contract system that the manor's owner entrusts a jito (manager and lord of manor) to manage his manor and pay the customs) in order to secure income by obliging a jito to pay a fixed amount of land tax in exchange for entrusting him with the management of the local <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> and koryo. <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Shoen.html">Shoen</a> and koryo that had such a contract were called ukedokoro. As jito ukedokoro with few exception were subjected to non-payment of land tax, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> got more involved in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> and koryo. </p>
<p>In the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a> was only assigned the right of Taibon sankajo (three basic rights of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a>, the provincial constable) and the right to supervise as part of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Obanyaku.html">Obanyaku</a> (a job to guard <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>). But early in the Muromachi period, the Muromachi <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>) granted various authorities to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a>, which would enable them to exert a range of administrative and economic influences on <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> and koryo in the country, such as the right to control <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Karita-rozeki.html">Karita-rozeki</a> (to reap rice illegally), the right to enforce the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> judicial decisions in land disputes (Shisetsu jungyo), the right to permit <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Hanzei (Half Payment of Taxes).html">hanzei</a> (half payment of tax), the right to confiscate property from criminals or if it is left derelict, the right to collect <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Tansen.html">tansen</a> (a tax on arable land). Based on these authorities, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a> sent Shugotsukai (messenger from <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a>) to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> and koryo, starting to requisition <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Tansen.html">tansen</a>, army provisions and laborers. They practically absorbed the functions of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Kokuga (provincial government office compounds).html">kokuga</a> and subjected koryo (gun, go, ho) governed by <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Kokuga (provincial government office compounds).html">kokuga</a> to their control. </p>
<p>Trying to deal with these trends, the lords of manors obtained the right of non-entry of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a>, but it was almost impossible for them to exert strong influence on the distant <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> because most of them lived in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. Some local jito, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Kokujin.html">kokujin</a> (local <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a>) and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shokan.html">shokan</a> (an officer governing <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a>) were hired as low-level bureaucrats by <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a>, and the lords' authority (hegemony over estates) was vulnerable to violation. Eventually, Shugouke was introduced, and under the system similar to Jitouke in the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a> shouldered the responsibility for paying a fixed amount of land tax and managing <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a>. In some cases <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a> obtained the right of Shugouke by actively pressing the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>, and in other cases lords of manors, exhausted by the disputes and suits with <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a>, approved Shugouke. Not only Shugouke but also ukedokoro of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shugodai.html">Shugodai</a> (deputy of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a>, provincial constable) existed. </p>
<p>The following is an example of Shugouke. In the case of Otanosho (Ota manor) in Koyasan territory, Bingo Province, the Yamana clan officially acquired the right to manage Shitaji (land) in 1402 and became <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a> on condition that they would deliver to Koyasan 1,000 koku (of rice) (a unit of volume: rice 1 koku is 180.39 liter, lumber 1 koku is 0.278 cubic meter) every year. Originally, the nengu Koyasan received from Otanosho was 1,800 koku per year. <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Nengu (Land Tax).html">Nengu</a> to be collected from the Yamana clan were often overdue, and by 1439 the amount in arrear accumulated to 26,000 koku. This was not an exceptional case. Under almost every Shugouke, there were non-payments of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Nengu (Land Tax).html">nengu</a> every year on the pretext of droughts or floods, and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> and koryo managed under ukedokoro virtually turned into Shugoryo (guardian's territory). In other words, Shugouke encouraged the expansion and accumulation of Shugoryo and it was a factor that formed the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Shugo-ryogoku system.html">Shugo-ryogoku system</a> (the system that a <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a> dominates a manor). </p>
<p>But not every <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> and koryo in those days were subject to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a> ukedokoro. Many <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> persisted, enduring the invasion of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a> and other <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a>. However, without a doubt the number of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> and koryo decreased due to Shugouke. Later, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> koryo sei (The System of Public Lands and Private Estate), the socioeconomic system throughout the medieval period, rapidly disintegrated. </p>
