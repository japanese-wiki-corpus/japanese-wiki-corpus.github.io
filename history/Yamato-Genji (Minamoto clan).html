<h1>Yamato-Genji (Minamoto clan) (大和源氏)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Yamato-Genji, a branch of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Seiwa-Genji (Minamoto clan).html">Seiwa-Genji</a> (Minamoto clan), was started by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Yorichika.html">MINAMOTO no Yorichika</a>, the second son of MINAMOTO no Mitsunaka. Yorichika became the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kokushi.html">kokushi</a> (provincial governor) of the Province of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yamato.html">Yamato</a>, and extended his power across the Province; during this process he fought against the forces of Nanto (southern capital [Nara]), such as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Kofuku-ji Temple.html">Kofuku-ji Temple</a>, and was exiled. </p>
<p>However, his descendants were scattered throughout <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yamato Province.html">Yamato Province</a>; they were continuously in conflict with the forces of Nanto but were undergoing increased indigenization. Among them, those who fought on the side of the same family (Yamato-Genji) appeared in the historical record, such as the monk <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shinjitsu.html">Shinjitsu</a>, a fifth-generation descendant of Yorichika, who took the seat of honor in Kofuku-ji Temple--their old enemy--and joined the Nanto forces. </p>
<p>During the Hogen War in 1156, MINAMOTO no Chikaharu (Chikaharu UNO), who was also a fifth-generation descendant of Yorichika and a worthy opponent of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shinjitsu.html">Shinjitsu</a>, supported the retired <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Sutoku.html">Emperor Sutoku</a>; for this reason he became a prisoner of war, but due to the farsightedness of the retired <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Goshirakawa.html">Emperor Goshirakawa</a>, who wanted to discourage the expansion of the Nanto forces, he was pardoned and returned home. In 1180, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Yorimasa.html">MINAMOTO no Yorimasa</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Prince Mochihito.html">Prince Mochihito</a> joined forces and raised an army; the names of Chikaharu and his sons appeared among the group of the Minamoto clan that encouraged insurrection in many districts, and this shows that Yamato-Genji still maintained their power within the province. </p>
<p>However, Yamato-Genji didn't demonstrate much military prowess in the Jisho-Juei War, and subsequently they just continued as a powerful regional clan; throughout the middle ages they gradually lost their unity and spread out to other districts. The following clans claimed to be the descendants of Yamato-Genji: the Uno clan from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yamato Province.html">Yamato Province</a>, starting from the above-mentioned Chikaharu; the Hijikata clan of Katsuhisa HIJIKATA, who served Nobukatsu ODA; the Kumabe clan of Higo Province; the Ishikawa clan of Mutsu Province; the Takagi clan of Mikawa Province; and Hikoshichi OMORI of Iyo Province, who is believed to have slain <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Masashige KUSUNOKI.html">Masashige KUSUNOKI</a>. </p>
