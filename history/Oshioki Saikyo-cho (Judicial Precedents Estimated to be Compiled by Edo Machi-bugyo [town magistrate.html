<p></p>
<p>Oshioki Saikyo-cho was a compilation of legal reports thought to be created by Edo <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Machi-bugyo (town magistrate).html">machi-bugyo</a> in Hoei era (1704 to 1710). Although the existing version (currently owned by the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/National Diet Library (NDL).html">National Diet Library</a>) has 12 volumes, it is believed that the original version consisted of three volumes. </p>
<p>From the records of 'Rocho' (prison records) of which <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Machi-bugyo (town magistrate).html">machi-bugyo</a> (town magistrates) stored the name and crime situation of each inmate of the prison located in Kodenma-cho, Edo, 974 cases reported between 1657 and 1699 were extracted and classified into 231 types of crime so as to provide a reference for future trials. Although 'Rocho' itself was under the Machi <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Bugyo.html">bugyo</a>'s control, inmates who were judged in the prison by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kanjo bugyo (commissioner of finance).html">Kanjo bugyo</a> (commissioner of finance) or <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Jisha (Buddhist Temples and Shinto Shrines).html">Jisha</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Bugyo.html">bugyo</a> (magistrate of temples and shrines) and cases under the jurisdiction of them were included in the Oshioki Saikyo-cho.
