<h1>Ikuno Bugyo (Ikuno Magistrate) (生野奉行)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Ikuno Bugyo was administered under Nobunaga ODA, Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI as well as the Tokugawa Shogunate, and it controlled the area of Ikuno Ginzan Silver Mine. In 1716, due to the decrease in the volume of silver production at Ikuno Ginzan Silver Mine, the Ikuno bugyo was reorganized to the Ikuno daikan (the regional officer of Ikuno). </p>
<p>The bugyosho (magistrate's office)/daikansho (regional officer's office) was located near Ikuno Elementary School located in Kuchiganaya, Ikuno-cho, Asago City, Hyogo Prefecture. </p>
<p>11 bugyo served at the Ikuno bugyosho and after the reorganization took place, 28 daikan served at the Ikuno daikansho during the Edo period. A hatamoto (direct retainers of the bakufu, which is a form of Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun) was appointed as the daikan, and he administered Tajima Province, Harima Province, as well as Mimasaka Province which were the hinterlands of Ikuno Ginzan Silver Mine. Furthermore, the scale under administration was larger than the area ruled by the Izushi Domain, which was the largest domain in Tajima Province, and during the initial years of the Edo period, the area totaled to 52,000 koku (an unit of assessed crop yields of the land [1 koku: about 180 liter], which was also used to express the size of the land) and at the end of the Edo period to 82,000 koku. </p>
<p>The daikansho was taken over during the uprising of the Ikuno Incident which took place in October, 1863, towards the end of the Edo period. Ikuno Incident, along with the Tenchu-gumi Incident, is evaluated as the precursor for the Meiji Restoration. </p>
<p>The area that the Ikuno daikansho ruled after the Meiji Restoration was, in the order of, Fuchu Court, then Kumihama Prefecture and finally as Ikuno Prefecture, and they were either partitioned or incorporated into Toyooka Prefecture, Himeji Prefecture, and Hokujo Prefecture. At present, it is part of Hyogo Prefecture as well as Okayama Prefecture. </p>
