<h1>Stone spatula (石篦)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>A stone spatula is a kind of flake stone tool in a spatula-like shape, and it is considered to be used for cutting trees or bones, tanning animal skins, or maybe digging ground. It existed for a long period from the early, middle to the end of Jomon period; however, it was distributed only in geographically limited area, mainly from the north of Tohoku region to the south of Hokkaido, and rarely discovered in other regions. </p>
