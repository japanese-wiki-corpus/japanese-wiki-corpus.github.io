<h1>Tato (田堵)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Tato means the wealthy farmer class that managed rice fields belonging to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> (manor) or <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kokugaryo.html">kokugaryo</a> (rice fields governed by provincial government office) during Japan's Heian period. Tato (田堵) is also written in Chinese characters as "田刀" or "田頭." The term '田刀' first appeared in kenden-cho (note of Cadastral Surveys) of Echinosho, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Omi Province.html">Omi Province</a> owned by Ganko-ji Temple, as of December 895. The Chinese character "堵" included in "田堵" means a fence. </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>When the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ritsuryo.html">Ritsuryo</a> system (a system of centralized government based on <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ritsuryo.html">ritsuryo</a> code) began to dissolve around the ninth-tenth century, some farmers amassed wealth by cultivating rice fields which they rented from others. These people were called Tato. Many Tato were local powerful clans, who were the descendants of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Gunji.html">Gunji</a> (local magistrate) during ancient times, or ex-officials such as native provisional governors. With amassed wealth in hand, they further accumulated wealth by developing and managing additional land or subjected other petty farmers by lending rice seeds to them. </p>
<p>Then, when <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Koden.html">koden</a> (rice fields administered directly by a ruler) located in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kokugaryo.html">kokugaryo</a> was reorganized into <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Myoden.html">myoden</a> (rice fields owned by a nominal holder), Tato became the persons who undertook the management of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Myoden.html">myoden</a>. Further, when reorganization into <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Myoden.html">myoden</a> reached <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a>, Tato undertook the management of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Myoden.html">myoden</a> located inside <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> as well. Thus, Tato were deeply engaged in the management of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a>/koryo (public land) and eventually gained the status of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shokan.html">shokan</a> (an officer governing <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a>) or <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Myoshu.html">myoshu</a> (owner of rice fields). It may be said that Tato played a large role in the process of establishing <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> koryo sei (The system of Public Land and Private Estates). </p>
<p>Depending upon the scale of land under their management, they were called either Daimyo Tato or Shomyo Tato. We can learn the reality of Tato from the following descriptions included in the "Shinsarugakuki," a book written in the eleventh century reflecting the social conditions at the time. 
<br/>Dewa gon no suke (Deputy governor of Dewa Province) Toyomasu TANAKA is a specialist in agricultural management and at the same time, he is Daimyo Tato who manages several hectares of rice fields.'<br/>
He nurtures farmers while preparing for drought by maintaining farming tools and irrigation channels and leads farmers well when it's time to sow their seeds.'<br/>
