<h1>Omiya (近江屋)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Omiya is a venerable soy sauce store in Kyoto. The store was managed by Shinsuke IGUCHI of Omiya from Iguchi family, a reputable family that owned lands in the area of present Shijo Kawaramachi. It is also known as a place where Ryoma SAKAMOTO and Shintaro NAKAOKA were assassinated (the Omiya incident). Now a travel agency is located at the site of Omiya, and only a stone monument remains in the place where Sakamoto and Nakaoka met a disaster. A grave of the Iguchi family, the master of Omiya, is located in Konkai Komyo-ji Temple. </p>
