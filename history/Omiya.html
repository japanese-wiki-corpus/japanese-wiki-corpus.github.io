<h1>Omiya (近江屋)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Omiya is a venerable soy sauce store in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. The store was managed by Shinsuke IGUCHI of Omiya from Iguchi family, a reputable family that owned lands in the area of present <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Shijo Kawaramachi.html">Shijo Kawaramachi</a>. It is also known as a place where <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Ryoma SAKAMOTO.html">Ryoma SAKAMOTO</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Shintaro NAKAOKA.html">Shintaro NAKAOKA</a> were assassinated (the Omiya incident). Now a travel agency is located at the site of Omiya, and only a stone monument remains in the place where Sakamoto and Nakaoka met a disaster. A grave of the Iguchi family, the master of Omiya, is located in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Konkai Komyo-ji Temple.html">Konkai Komyo-ji Temple</a>. </p>
