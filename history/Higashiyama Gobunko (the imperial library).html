<h1>Higashiyama Gobunko (the imperial library) (東山御文庫)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Higashiyama Go-bunko refers to the imperial family library located in northeast corner of Kyoto Imperial Palace. It is also called Kinri Gobunko and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Higashiyama (Kyoto Prefecture).html">Higashiyama</a> bunko. The past emperors' <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Shinto/Shinkan.html">shinkan</a> (imperial letter) or the collections, the favorite calligraphic works and paintings and tools, which are about 60,000 items, are stored. </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>At present it is treated as chokufu (imperial seal) same as Todai-ji Temple <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/building/Shosoin.html">Shosoin</a> and so on, and jiju (a chamberlain) of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Imperial Household Agency.html">Imperial Household Agency</a> manages it. Except for the special examination by experts in the occasion of bakuryo (airing) in autumn (the 'airing' for stored items is regularly done), it is not opened to the public. However, the items are being microfilmed by the Imperial Household Archives and are being copied by Historiographical Institute of The University of Tokyo ('Kyoto Imperial Palace Higashiyama Gobunko Record'), and a part of the contents comes to be opened to the public. </p>
<p>The name '<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Higashiyama (Kyoto Prefecture).html">Higashiyama</a>' originates from the fact that dozo (warehouse made of soil) in the Konoe family, called '<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Higashiyama (Kyoto Prefecture).html">Higashiyama</a> no goko,' was presented and transferred by <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Tadahiro KONOE.html">Tadahiro KONOE</a> in 1881 and was used for a facility of the library. Thus, it is not directly related with Higashimaya-dono of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Yoshimasa ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshimasa ASHIKAGA</a> or the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Higashiyama.html">Emperor Higashiyama</a> (the one hundred thirteenth Emperor) and so on. <h3>History</h3>
</p>
<p>In the Imperial family, various books and so on had been inherited from ancient times, but through the economic decline in the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Onin War.html">Onin War</a> or the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Sengoku Period (period of warring states) (Japan).html">Sengoku Period</a> (Period of Warring States) (Japan), many of them were lost. After that, the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Goyozei.html">Emperor Goyozei</a> and the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Gomizunoo.html">Emperor Gomizunoo</a> did their best to collect the books with the stabilization of the society, but the fire on July 17, 1653 burned almost all the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Dairi (the Imperial palace).html">dairi</a> (Imperial Palace) and all the libraries were burnt down except for one. Disturbed by this, the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Gosai.html">Emperor Gosai</a> and the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Reigen.html">Emperor Reigen</a> asked court nobles or temples and shrines in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> to accurately copy waka (a traditional Japanese poem of thirty-one syllables), stories, diaries, records, Yusoku kojitsu (court and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> rules of ceremony and etiquette), documents on kuji (public duties) and shrines and temples and so on, and furthermore, made the precious books and documents copied to be the duplicates and stored them in the other places in order to prevent the loss. On February 14, 1661, again the fire in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Dairi (the Imperial palace).html">dairi</a> burned the remained books and documents, but the duplicates in the other places remained safe. Successive emperors took this chance to do their best to collect precious books and make the duplicate books and maintain the storehouses for the duplicate books. This was the beginning of Hiagashiyama bunko. Emperors themselves were deeply involved with the collection of the precious books and production of copies, and many of the contents and titles were written by the Shinpitsu (emperor's own handwriting), as for book collection seals, the era names on the throne such as the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Gosai.html">Emperor Gosai</a> ('Meireki era'), the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Higashiyama.html">Emperor Higashiyama</a> ('Genroku era'), the Emperor Gosakuramachi ('Meiwa Era') and so on were used, or unified seal called 'imperial line bunko' was used (for example, the Gosai Emperor, the Sakuramachi Emperor and the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Komei.html">Emperor Komei</a>), and some emperors made unique book collection seals such as 'Osahito,' 'Konohana,' 'Tenen' and so on, like the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Komei.html">Emperor Komei</a>. 
<br/>After the transfer of the capital to Tokyo, a part of the stored books in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Dairi (the Imperial palace).html">dairi</a> was transferred to new Imperial Palace and furthermore, in the establishment of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Miyake.html">miyake</a> (families allowed to have the status of Imperial family), some of them were allocated to them (However, all the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Miyake.html">miyake</a> which received the allocation were discontinued later and the stored books were transferred to Imperial Household Archives or National Museum of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Japanese History.html">Japanese History</a>.)<br/>
Later, the original houses were decided to be demolished when the Konoe family moved to Tokyo, but the okura (a rice storehouse of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Edo bakufu.html">Edo bakufu</a>) of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Higashiyama (Kyoto Prefecture).html">Higashiyama</a> was presented and used for storing the remained books and thus the name became a name of the library. </p>
