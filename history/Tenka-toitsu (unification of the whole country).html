<h1>Tenka-toitsu (unification of the whole country) (天下統一)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Tenka-toitsu (or Tenga-toitsu) refers to the act of putting the whole country of Japan (except for most parts of Ryukyu and Ezo [inhabited area of Ainu]) under own control and unifying it, mainly during the period from the Seongoku Period (Period of Warring State) to the early Edo period. It is also called Tenka-itto. </p>
<p>The term '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Tenka (the realm).html">Tenka</a>' (the realm) refers to a concept in ancient China, which showed an area governed by an emperor, and was often used also in Japan. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Shinkoku (divine land).html">Shinkoku</a> kan (view of divine land) which spread in and after the medieval period, then became a logic justifying the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> government, and a person in paramount authority was called 'Tenkabito' (person becoming the ruler of the country). </p>
<p>In the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Sengoku Period (period of warring states) (Japan).html">Sengoku Period</a> (Period of Warring States), <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Nobunaga ODA.html">Nobunaga ODA</a> implemented a unification project by military power, under the slogan of 'Tenka-fubu' (a slogan that means that the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> governs the whole world). When Nobunaga died in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Honnoji Incident.html">Honnoji Incident</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI.html">Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI</a>, Oda family's vassal, succeeded to and accomplished the unification of the whole country which had been unaccomplished. The term '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Tenka (the realm).html">Tenka</a>' originally meant that the controlled territory was borderless. After unifying the whole of Japan in 1590, Hideyoshi started dispatching troops to Ming (the Bunroku-Keicho War) in 1592. The Hideyoshi's dispatch of troops to Korea ended in failure, and in the Edo period when the Tokugawa <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun family.html">Shogun family</a> ruled Japan, the term '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Tenka (the realm).html">Tenka</a>' was used in only referring to the Japanese archipelago. </p>
