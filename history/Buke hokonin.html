<h1>Buke hokonin (武家奉公人)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Buke hokonin literally means a person who served a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> family. </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>Buke hokonin also refers to a wakato (foot-man), chugen (the rank below common soldier), or komono, but these cannot be clearly discerned because their meaning varied by region, clan, or <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> family. Therefore, the following description dividing them into wakato, chugen, and komono should be read only as a guide. </p>
<p>At the end of the Edo period, the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Edo bakufu.html">Edo bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>) and its domains were forced to eliminate their 'matchlock infantry' armed with matchlocks and to form a 'musket infantry' or 'musket unit' armed with Western style firearms, however, the number of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ashigaru.html">ashigaru</a> (common foot soldiers) was sometimes not enough to form these infantries or units and, in these cases, new members were recruited to create a musket infantry similar to the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ashigaru.html">ashigaru</a> troops in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Sengoku Period (period of warring states) (Japan).html">Sengoku Period</a> (Period of Warring States). Those who belonged to these classes were treated as chugen class, lower than <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ashigaru.html">ashigaru</a>. </p>
<p>Wakato<br/>
</p>
<p>This word referred to new or young people among the roto (retainers) in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Sengoku Period (period of warring states) (Japan).html">Sengoku Period</a>. </p>
<p>Generally, it is little different from komono, but in the Edo period the word was sometimes used to refer to vassals who served <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Hatamoto (direct retainers of shogun).html">hatamoto</a> (direct vassals of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>) or vassals of the castle keeper of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">Daimyo</a> (Japanese feudal lord), and in these cases the name refers to people of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> status. In the expression 'number of accompanying <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a>' '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a>' means wakato. </p>
<p>In the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period, it was believed that if a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Baishin (indirect vassal).html">baishin</a> (indirect vassal) was ranked as being of the warrior class affairs of state would begin to worsen, so they were treated as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Heimin (commoners).html">heimin</a> (commoners) even though they had been '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a>' in the Edo period. </p>
<p>However, vassals of the Inada clan, the keepers of Sumoto-jo Castle, who were known for the Kogo incident (also known as Inada uproar), were exceptionally promoted to the warrior class under strict conditions such as their migration to Hokkaido. </p>
<p>Chugen<br/>
</p>
<p>They sometimes participated in battles with a short sword and did odd jobs in times of peace. They also served as yakko (a servant or attendant) in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a>'s processions, and so on. </p>
<p>Many served temporarily as watari-chugen (itinerant servants). </p>
<p>Type 1: Temporary chugen<br/>
</p>
<p>They were what would now be called deemed public servants. This refers to chugen who were widely and generally known. </p>
<p>In the Edo period, chugen were servants under articles of apprenticeship or were recruited from an on a temporary basis only when needed. Those who served as chugen were the second-oldest sons or younger brothers of peasants, but in big cities such as Edo, many were recruited as professional servants such as watari-chugen who served from residence to residence. </p>
<p>Type 2: Special chugen<br/>
</p>
<p>In reality they were treated as equivalent to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ashigaru.html">ashigaru</a>. Widely and generally known chugen were as mentioned above, but this special type of chugen refers to those from families who served domains by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Heredity.html">heredity</a> and had the right to bear a surname and to wear a sword during the Edo period, or those who were formally employed by domains or recruited for special occasions at the end of Edo period. Their class was between <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Heimin (commoners).html">heimin</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a>. They were special cases rather than the norm. </p>
<p>The class of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Aritomo YAMAGATA.html">Aritomo YAMAGATA</a> and Hirobumi ITO of the Choshu Domain is given as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ashigaru.html">ashigaru</a> in historical sources because the term special chugen would have been likely to be misleading and easily mixed up with widely and generally known chugen. </p>
<p>Komono<br/>
</p>
<p>Private buke hokonin<br/>
They were live-in servants who did mainly odd jobs. They were also called <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shonin.html">shonin</a> or genan (houseboys). When a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Doshin (patrol officer).html">doshin</a> (police constable) of a town magistrate's office arrested people he sometimes called them komono. They were of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Heimin (commoners).html">heimin</a> class. </p>
