<p>Kaihatsu-ryoshu (also pronounced as Kaihotsu-ryoshu) were those who owned the lands they developed as their territories in <a href="https://www.japanesewiki.com/history/Shoen.html">Shoen</a> koryo sei (The System of Public Lands and Private Estates) in Japan. They were also called konpon-ryoshu. </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>After <a href="https://www.japanesewiki.com/history/Konden (New rice field).html">Konden</a> einen shizai Law (a law allowing farmers who cleared new lands to own them permanently) took effect in 743, a number of land owners based on <a href="https://www.japanesewiki.com/history/Konden (New rice field).html">konden</a> (newly developed rice field) emerged over an extensive area. Originally, Kaihatsu meant to 'carve out and revive' the land, suggesting not only cultivation of undeveloped wilderness, but also resumption of ruined fields. An award given to developers who resumed ruined fields was at first nothing but the right to cultivate the land on a temporary basis, but eventually evolved into permanent rights in the early Heian period, which greatly motivated Tato (wealthy cultivators) and powerful local clans at <a href="https://www.japanesewiki.com/title/Gunji.html">Gunji</a> (magistrates) level to cultivate fields. <a href="https://www.japanesewiki.com/history/Kokuga (provincial government office compounds).html">Kokuga</a> (provincial government offices), in turn, used incentives such as exemption from <a href="https://www.japanesewiki.com/history/Kanmotsu.html">kanmotsu</a> (tribute goods paid as taxes or tithes) to constantly recruit land developers inside and outside of their provinces. However, since in many cases resumed ruined lands would end up being confiscated by <a href="https://www.japanesewiki.com/history/Kokuga (provincial government office compounds).html">kokuga</a>, in the mid-Heian period, a load-style development method of widely taking up and carving out undeveloped wilderness outside of cultivated areas became the mainstream. </p>
<p>Developers would start their development by applying for it to <a href="https://www.japanesewiki.com/history/Kokuga (provincial government office compounds).html">kokuga</a>. First, setting up the development base, they paid development expenses to recruit ronin (masterless <a href="https://www.japanesewiki.com/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a>) and peasants as workforce inside and outside of their provinces. <a href="https://www.japanesewiki.com/history/Kenin.html">Kenin</a> (retainers), low ranked people, and followers of the developers acted as managers of the workforce. In parallel with acquisition of labor for the development, construction and improvement of ponds, ditches and dikes were also carried out. At developed farmlands, strong ruling rights were officially given to shoryo (territory) fields and their farmers by <a href="https://www.japanesewiki.com/history/Kokuga (provincial government office compounds).html">kokuga</a>. Within <a href="https://www.japanesewiki.com/history/Kokugaryo.html">Kokugaryo</a> (territories governed by provincial government office), developed fields were categorized as Gun, Go, Ho, and Bechimyo. Kaihatsu-ryoshu were assumed the position of the officers' organization, such as <a href="https://www.japanesewiki.com/title/Gunji.html">Gunji</a> (a local government for Gun territory), Goji (a local government official for Go territory), Hoji (a local government official for Ho territory), and Bechimyo <a href="https://www.japanesewiki.com/history/Myoshu.html">myoshu</a> (a local government official for Bechimyo territory), and guaranteed the local load rights, which included the rights for <a href="https://www.japanesewiki.com/history/Shomu.html">shomu</a> (land management) centered on <a href="https://www.japanesewiki.com/history/Kanno.html">Kanno</a> (encouragement of agriculture) of developed fields, private tax collection of <a href="https://www.japanesewiki.com/history/Zoyaku.html">zoyaku</a> (odd-jobs tasks) and <a href="https://www.japanesewiki.com/history/Buyaku.html">buyaku</a> (labor service), and judgment of criminal cases. The situation for development inside <a href="https://www.japanesewiki.com/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> was the same, where kaihatsu-ryoshu were appointed as lower ranked officers or <a href="https://www.japanesewiki.com/history/Kumon (official document).html">kumon</a> (a local <a href="https://www.japanesewiki.com/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> official below the gesu in rank), and so on. </p>
<p>Kaihatsu-ryoshu carefully stored the documents that clearly stipulated the basis of their rights (<a href="https://www.japanesewiki.com/history/Kugen (legal certificate).html">kugen</a> [a type of certification authorizing a certain privilege to a person]), handing them down for generations. However, it was highly possible that authorization to them were revoked upon the change of <a href="https://www.japanesewiki.com/title/Kokushi.html">kokushi</a> (provincial governors), and also, disputes with other kaihatsu-ryoshu often erupted over such elements as the border. Therefore, kaihatsu-ryoshu tried to secure their dominion and management rights by donating their developed fields to major central nobility, temples, and shrines, that were more powerful than <a href="https://www.japanesewiki.com/history/Kokuga (provincial government office compounds).html">kokuga</a>, to eliminate the pressure from <a href="https://www.japanesewiki.com/history/Kokuga (provincial government office compounds).html">kokuga</a> (those <a href="https://www.japanesewiki.com/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> were specifically categorized as donated <a href="https://www.japanesewiki.com/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a>). In many cases, when donating <a href="https://www.japanesewiki.com/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a>, kaihatsu-ryoshu were appointed as <a href="https://www.japanesewiki.com/title/Shokan.html">shokan</a> (an officer governing <a href="https://www.japanesewiki.com/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a>) by the lord of the manor to whom they donated it. However, also being <a href="https://www.japanesewiki.com/history/Zaichokanjin.html">Zaichokanjin</a> (local officials in the Heian and <a href="https://www.japanesewiki.com/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> periods), kaihatsu-ryoshu would remain inside the <a href="https://www.japanesewiki.com/history/Kokugaryo.html">kokugaryo</a> if they determined it would be advantageous for them to keep close ties with <a href="https://www.japanesewiki.com/history/Kokuga (provincial government office compounds).html">kokuga</a>. </p>
<p>In around the mid-Heian period, a number of lower-ranking noblemen with <a href="https://www.japanesewiki.com/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> status, who were left out of the central political world, went down to the provinces. Kaihatsu-ryoshu tried to establish the lord-and-vassal relationship with those <a href="https://www.japanesewiki.com/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> to facilitate dispute resolution over their <a href="https://www.japanesewiki.com/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a>. As a result, many kaihatsu-ryoshu became <a href="https://www.japanesewiki.com/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a>. In the <a href="https://www.japanesewiki.com/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period, some kaihatsu-ryoshu were even appointed as jito (manager and lord of manor) or <a href="https://www.japanesewiki.com/title/Gokenin.html">gokenin</a> (an immediate vassal of the shogunate in the <a href="https://www.japanesewiki.com/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> and Muromachi through Edo periods). </p>
