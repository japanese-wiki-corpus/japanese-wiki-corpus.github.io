<h1>Tenmon Hahakase (Doctor of Astronomy) (天文博士)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Tenmon hakase was a government post belonging to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Onmyoryo.html">Onmyoryo</a> (Bureau of Divination) in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ritsuryo.html">ritsuryo</a> system of ancient Japan. The status was equivalent to shoshichiinoge (Senior Seventh Rank, Lower Grade), and only one person could hold this a position at a time. </p>
<p><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Onmyoryo.html">Onmyoryo</a> consisted of three subjects--onmyodo (yin-yang philosophy), <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Rekido.html">rekido</a> (learning of the calendar) and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Tenmondo.html">tenmondo</a> (ancient horoscopy)--and tenmon hakase was the teacher of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Tenmondo.html">tenmondo</a>. Tenmon hakase observed the celestial bodies and reported in fortune-telling, which was sealed if there was any unusual event (it's called tenmon misso), and also taught the students the way of fortune-telling through astronomical <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Observation.html">observation</a>. </p>
<p>In the middle of the Heian period, since <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/KAMO no Yasunori.html">KAMO no Yasunori</a> taught <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Tenmondo.html">tenmondo</a> to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/ABE no Seimei.html">ABE no Seimei</a>, tenmon hakase also became a hereditary post of the Abe clan. The details of tenmonmisso are written in the compilation of more than 20 tenmonmisso 'Abe no Yasuchika Asonki,' as reported with the signatures of onmyojo (onmyo vice-minister) KAMO no Yasuchika and tenmon hakase, Abe no Naritoshi. </p>
