<h1>Sechi-e (節会)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The term "Sechi-e" means official events held at the Japanese Imperial Court on the day of Sekku (seasonal festivals) etc. with the attendance of the Emperor and a large number of his subjects. Sechi-e were accompanied by banquets. </p>
<p><h3>The main Sechi-e</h3>
</p>
<p>The history of Sechi-e dates back to the time before the Nara period (the time when Japan was under the Ritsuryo system). </p>

<h3>Gosechi-e (five seasonal festivals)</h3>
</p>
<p>Gantan, Hakuba, Toka, Tango, and Toyoakari were particularly emphasized during the Heian period as Gosechi-e. <h3>Gosekku (five seasonal festivals)</h3>
