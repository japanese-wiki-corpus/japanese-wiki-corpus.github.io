<h1>Tenpo (転封)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Tenpo (aka Tenpu) refers to what the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Edo bakufu.html">Edo bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by the seii taishogun [literally, "great general who subdues the barbarians"]) changed <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a>'s (Japanese feudal lord) territories to different locations. Tenpo is almost a synonym for Kunigae and Ifu. </p>
<p>The terms such as 'Kunigae,' 'Tokorogae' and 'Tokutai' were used in records instead of Tenpo. </p>
<p>Tenpo was one of the powers of disposition and control that the unified authority had over all the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> in modern times. </p>
<p>After the Taiko <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kenchi.html">kenchi</a> (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI.html">Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI</a>'s nationwide land survey), Tenpo were enforced based on the concept that the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a>, who was also called Tenkabito (person becoming the ruler of the country), had ultimate ownership of even <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a>'s territories. </p>
<p>However, territories were often changed with additional properties, so Tenpo is not categorically described as disposition and control. </p>
<p>It is said that the first case of Tenpo was that <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI.html">Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI</a> transferred the Tokugawa clan from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Sunpu.html">Sunpu</a> in Suruga Province to Edo in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Musashi Province.html">Musashi Province</a> in 1590. </p>
<p>In the Edo period, the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> started to enforce Tenpo, and in the early of the period, the basic policy of Tenpo was to transfer the Tozama <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> (nonhereditary feudal lord) to regional areas and to transfer the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> on the Tokugawa clan's side (called the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/family/Shinpan (Tokugawas relatives).html">Shinpan</a> [Tokugawa's relatives] and the Fudai [hereditary vassals]) to the former territories of the Tozama <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a>. </p>
<p>After the middle of the period, Tenpo of the Tozama <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> extremely decreased, and administrative Tenpo of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> on the Tokugawa clan's side on their appointments in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>'s posts became mainstream. </p>
<p>On the other hand, it is a fact that Tenpo took away the aspect of zaichi ryoshu (resident landlords) from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a>, playing a role in promoting the transition from the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Jigatachigyo.html">Jigatachigyo</a> system (provision of lands from a feudal government or domains to retainers as salary) to the horoku system (salary). </p>
<p>This was a very important event for the kinsei ("early modern") <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> in heading their vassals, and this is also one of the elements that distinguish the Kinsei <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> from the Sengoku <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> (Japanese territorial lord in the Sengoku period). </p>
<p>For the people including peasants, Tenpo meant what the rights they had acquired before would be denied due to the changes of their feudal lords, so the people sometimes staged opposition uprisings. The Tenpo <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Hatto (Lecture Hall).html">Hatto</a> (The laws for changing the territory) had the words about nonpayment of tribute and the loss or damage of a borrowed thing, so land sales contracts came to contain the words to reject debt cancellation orders at an early stage. </p>
<p>Tenpo was the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>'s absolute authority over all the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> during the Edo period, so the failure in 1840 of changing three <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a>'s territories one another at the same time symbolized the diminishing authority of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>. </p>
