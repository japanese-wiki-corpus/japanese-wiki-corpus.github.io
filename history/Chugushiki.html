<h1>Chugushiki (中宮職)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Chugushiki was the office which belonged to Nakatsukasasho (Ministry of Central Affairs) and was in charge of the consort's household affairs under the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ritsuryo.html">Ritsuryo</a> system (a system of centralized government based on the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ritsuryo.html">ritsuryo</a> code). It was originally in charge of the affairs of all consorts' households, but later Taikotaigogushiki, Kotaigogushiki and Kogogushiki were separately established for <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Grand Empress Dowager.html">Grand Empress Dowager</a>, Empress Dowager and Empress respectively (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ritsuryo.html">Ritsuryo</a> system). </p>
