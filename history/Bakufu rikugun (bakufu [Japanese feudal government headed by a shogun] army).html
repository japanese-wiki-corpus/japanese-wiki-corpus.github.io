<p><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">Bakufu</a> rikugun is a military organization with western-style armaments which was organized by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Edo bakufu.html">Edo bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>) in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Edo Period.html">Edo Period</a> to accomplish battles on land as a mission. In 1882, it was established in order to defend the nation against attacks from outside and to maintain the system in the nation. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">Bakufu</a> rikugun experienced real battles through the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Choshu Conquest.html">Choshu Conquest</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Tenguto no Ran(Rebellion of Tenguto).html">Tenguto no Ran</a> (Rebellion of Tenguto). Many troops of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> rikugun continued battles in Boshin War even after the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> was overthrown in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Taisei Hokan (transfer of power back to the Emperor).html">Taisei Hokan</a> (transfer of power back to the Emperor). </p>
<p>History<br/>
Prehistory<br/>
<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Edo bakufu.html">Edo bakufu</a> maintained the system that lasted since the Sengoku period (period of warring states), with <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Hatamoto (direct retainers of shogun).html">hatamoto</a> (direct retainers of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>) and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Gokenin.html">gokenin</a> (shogunal retainers), as a military power under its direct control. These <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Hatamoto (direct retainers of shogun).html">hatamoto</a> comprised traditional military organizations including <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Koshogumi (page corps).html">koshogumi</a> (page corps) and Oban. However, the military organizations lost substances due to long peace. The <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>, which gradually developed a sense of crisis as they gained the information on the Opium War, appointed <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Shuhan TAKASHIMA.html">Shuhan TAKASHIMA</a> and Hidetatsu EGAWA to the instructors of gunnery, commencing studies on the western-style armament. </p>
<p>In 1845 after the arrival of the Black Ships, a bureau of military system improvement was placed under the reform by Masahiro ABE, roju (member of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>'s council of elders). As a result of review by the bureau of military system improvement, the establishment of Kobu jo (later known as kobu sho) which was the training agency for younger family members of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Hatamoto (direct retainers of shogun).html">hatamoto</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Gokenin.html">gokenin</a> was determined. In the Kobu jo which opened in April 1856, not only ancient swordplay but also the western-style gunnery and tactics were studied. The Kobu jo was expected to produce troops with power of execution, which can be said as a teaching and leading troop. Security guards for <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> called okuzume (adviser to the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>) were later organized. In November 1855, about the same time as the establishment of kobu-jo, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kachi.html">kachi</a> (Foot Guards) was obliged to study gunnery, while <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kojunin (小十人) (escort guards).html">Kojunin</a> (Escort Guard) was obliged to study gunnery in February 1856, under 江川英敏 who was the grandmaster of gunnery, thus, the training of western-style gunnery was commenced. The location of training to them was changed to the gunnery training center in Kobu sho after the establishment of Kobu sho and the training to them was carried on. In 1858, a training center for musket units were established in Fukagawa Ecchu shima. </p>
<p>However, after <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Naosuke II.html">Naosuke II</a> assumed the post of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Tairo (chief minister).html">Tairo</a> (chief minister), the deployment of western-style armament slowed down. </p>
<p>Military reform in Bunkyu Period<br/>
In 1862, after the Sakuradamongai Incident, `rikugun,' the full-scale western-style army as a part of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bunkyu Reform.html">Bunkyu Reform</a>, was established. The three members, foot soldier <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Bugyo.html">Bugyo</a>, horse soldier <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Bugyo.html">Bugyo</a>, and Army <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Bugyo.html">Bugyo</a> as a head, were placed, and the three soldiers tactics using foot soldiers, horse soldiers, and artillery were introduced. However, the rikugun, which was established through such process, was an organization which was collaterally existed with the traditional military organization. </p>
<p>The foot soldiers were classified into `hohei' who were equivalent to senretsu foot soldiers who form rows and `sappei' who were equivalent to 軽歩兵. Among them, foot soldier troops (infantry) were comprised of soldiers called heifu who were dispatched from <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Hatamoto (direct retainers of shogun).html">hatamoto</a> based on their rokudaka (stipend). The heifu in infantry stayed in the camp in Edo, and their salaries were paid by their respective <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Hatamoto (direct retainers of shogun).html">hatamoto</a>. On the other hand, the sappei-tai troops were composed of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Gokenin.html">gokenin</a> (an immediate vassal of the shogunate in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> and Muromachi through Edo periods) such as Kobushin-gumi (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> without official appointments who receive small salaries) in the rank below omemie (the title with the privilege to have an audience with one's lord, a dignitary, etc.), and it was referred as gojikodutsu-gumi until 1866. The horse soldier troops were composed of Kobushin-gumi in the rank over omemie such as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Yoriki (a governmental post in the Edo bakufu).html">yoriki</a> (a police sergeant) or <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Hatamoto (direct retainers of shogun).html">hatamoto</a>, while artillery was composed of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Doshin (patrol officer).html">doshin</a> (a police constable). The officers of those troops were mainly <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Hatamoto (direct retainers of shogun).html">hatamoto</a> or younger family members of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Hatamoto (direct retainers of shogun).html">hatamoto</a>. </p>
<p>They experienced real battles such as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Tenguto no Ran(Rebellion of Tenguto).html">Tenguto no Ran</a> (Rebellion of Tenguto) and the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Choshu Conquest.html">Choshu Conquest</a>. </p>
<p>The military reform in Keio Era<br/>
After August 1866, after the defeat in the second conquest of Choshu clan, the second large-scale military reform was executed under Shogun Yoshinobu TOKUGAWA. As the presidency (roju) system was introduced to the central organization of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>, a director-general of rikugun who was coequal to roju was established over the existing organization of rikugun. The military organizations which were directly controlled by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> were unified and the existing prior organizations including Oban (a group of guards in the Edo shogunate) were dismissed or shrunk. Among redundant soldiers, excellent members were transferred to rikugun as soldiers of okuzume musket unit, which was a kind of bodyguard organization, or as soldiers of Yugekitai (command unit who backs up okuzume). Kobu sho was also incorporated into rikugun, and became rikugun sho, as a research agency of rikugun. Hachioji Sennin <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Doshin (patrol officer).html">Doshin</a> (junior officials in Hachioji), which was already westernized to a certain degree, was also incorporated, changing its name to Hachioji Sennin tai. As the organization expanded, the chain of command was improved, such as upgrading Army <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Bugyo.html">Bugyo</a> to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Wakadoshiyori.html">wakadoshiyori</a>, the establishment of foot soldier <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Bugyo.html">Bugyo</a> nabi and Sappei <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Bugyo.html">Bugyo</a> nabi. </p>
<p>Military engineer troops called chikuzo hei (constructing troops) and goryo hei (imperial property troops) that was composed of farmers in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Tenryo (Shogunal Demesne).html">tenryo</a> (a shogunal demesne) were also organized. Direct training by French military advisors including senior lieutenant Charles Chanoine was introduced, and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Denshutai (Edo shogunates army).html">Denshutai</a> (Edo shogunate's army) was newly organized to be instructed by them. </p>
<p>The method to recruit soldiers was also modified. Aside from existing infantry that was comprised of heifu, the system of corporative musket units was established, under which each <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Hatamoto (direct retainers of shogun).html">hatamoto</a> was obliged to consolidate a musket unit according to his rokudaka, and several musket units were combined to organize platoons or battalions. Unlike infantry, the solders of cooperative musket units had to stand by in the residence of each <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Hatamoto (direct retainers of shogun).html">hatamoto</a> in peacetime. However, in January 1866, the system of heifu was abolished and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Hatamoto (direct retainers of shogun).html">hatamoto</a> paid cash instead of heifu, and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> directly hired soldiers with the cash (the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> infantry became a mercenary). Furthermore, in September of the same year, cooperative musket units were changed to infantry hired using the cash paid by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Hatamoto (direct retainers of shogun).html">hatamoto</a> due to the financial circumstances of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>. Military services of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Hatamoto (direct retainers of shogun).html">hatamoto</a> were paid by only cash. Each <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Hatamoto (direct retainers of shogun).html">hatamoto</a> was obliged to pay the half of koso (annual tax). </p>
<p>Eventually, the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> rikugun became the largest western-style military organization in Japan, centering on 8 regiments of infantry and 3 battalion of learning infantry (some sais that it should be 9 regiments as the sixteenth regiment was established in the territory of Harima of Hitotsubashi Tokugawa family). </p>
<p>After <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Taisei Hokan (transfer of power back to the Emperor).html">Taisei Hokan</a><br/>
After <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Taisei Hokan (transfer of power back to the Emperor).html">Taisei Hokan</a>, the Battle of Toba-Fushimi occurred. A lot of soldiers from infantry and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Denshutai (Edo shogunates army).html">Denshutai</a> joined these battles, but they were defeated. Afterwards, some soldiers returned to allegiance to the new <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> government. Some troops escaped, and in various places, they joined the battles in Boshin War. On the other hand, some troops which returned to allegiance were incorporated into the new government. </p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Choshu Conquest.html">Choshu Conquest</a><br/>
The four battalions of infantry, artillery-groups, gojikodutsu-gumi etc. joined the war. </p>
<p>The battle of Toba and Fushimi<br/>
The battle of Yashu-Yanada: the escaping troops (Shohotai) led by Sakuzaemon FURUYA suffered a severe defeat to the new government army (the Tosando force). </p>
<p>The battles of Kita Kanto (Northern Kanto): the escaping troops (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Denshutai (Edo shogunates army).html">Denshutai</a> etc.) led by Keisuke OTORI fought against the New government army in various places such as Utsunomiya Castle in Oyama, Imaichi, Fujiwara (the Battle of Utsunomiya Castle). </p>
<p>Hokuetsu War: Shohotai joined. </p>
<p>Aizu War: The Otori army and Shohotai fought against the New government army. They suffered a severe defeat in the Battle of Bonari-toge. </p>
<p>The battle of Goryokaku<br/>
Shohotai reorganized from infantry, learning infantry, learning officer troops etc. joined. </p>
<p>Education<br/>
At the beginning, they were educated mainly by using the translated manuals of the Dutch army. They had received trainings including the training on the battle of foot soldiers from the marines among the Dutch army's instructors who visited for navy training. </p>
<p>Subsequently, in 1864, the English-style education was introduced in some units. 下番 of Kanagawa Magistrate's office received trainings from and had exercises jointly with the English army that stationed in Yokohama City. A number of officers of Kanagawa Magistrate's office including Shigeaki KUBOTA or Sakuzaemon Furuya later became officers of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> rikugun infantry. 下番, soldiers, were incorporated into infantry, and were assigned to military guards in Hakodate, and so on. 
<br/>(For this reason, simple recognition of `<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> navy was English style and rice-gun was French style' is wrong.)<br/>
(<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Apart (Apartment).html">Apart</a> from <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>, some domains including the rikugun of the Kishu Domain were under the influence of Prussia rikugun [army]). </p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> rikugun was eventually educated by the French military advisory group, and in 1866, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Denshutai (Edo shogunates army).html">Denshutai</a> was organized. In the following year, officers including senior lieutenant Chanoine arrived, and firstly, the training commenced in Ota <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Jinya.html">jinya</a> (regional government office) in Yokohama City, and several months later, they transferred to Edo. In June, the education to be a officer was commenced for applicants of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Hatamoto (direct retainers of shogun).html">hatamoto</a> between 14 and 19 years old. Some soldiers of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Denshutai (Edo shogunates army).html">Denshutai</a> received trainings from Japanese instructors due to shortage of French instructors. </p>
<p>Organization<br/>
Regarding the infantry, the regiment consisting of two battalions (each battalion has 10 platoons is the largest unit of the army. For many troops other than the infantry, like <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Denshutai (Edo shogunates army).html">Denshutai</a> or sappei-tai troops, battalion was the largest unit. In some cases, companies, each of which was composed of two platoons, were used. For artillery units, the unit of `za' (8 cannons) was used. </p>
