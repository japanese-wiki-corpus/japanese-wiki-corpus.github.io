<h1>Bunchi-ha Faction (文治派)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The Bunchi-ha was a faction that existed during the Toyotomi administration. The Bunchi-ha faction was the rival of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Budan-ha.html">Budan-ha</a> faction. </p>
<p>The faction included <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Mitsunari ISHIDA.html">Mitsunari ISHIDA</a>, a member of the Five Commissioners (administrative organization of feudal Japan), Yoshitsugu OTANI and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yukinaga KONISHI.html">Yukinaga KONISHI</a>. After the death of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI.html">Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI</a> in 1596, clashes between the Bunchi-ha faction and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kiyomasa KATO.html">Kiyomasa KATO</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Masanori FUKUSHIMA.html">Masanori FUKUSHIMA</a> and others in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Budan-ha.html">Budan-ha</a> faction became more intense. In 1600, when Mitsunari and his followers took up arms against <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Ieyasu TOKUGAWA.html">Ieyasu TOKUGAWA</a>, who was a member of the Council of Five Elders, the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Budan-ha.html">Budan-ha</a> faction sided with Ieyasu leading to the Battle of Sekigahara. The defeat at Sekigahara ended in the execution of Mitsunari and others, and the system of Five Commissioners of Toyotomi administration disintegrated. </p>
