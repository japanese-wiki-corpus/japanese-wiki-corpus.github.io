<h1>Saigokusuji-gundai (a magistrate of Kyushu region) (西国筋郡代)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Saigokusuji-gundai was one of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Gundai.html">gundai</a> set in four places in the Edo period. It is also known as Saigoku-gundai. </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>Saigokusuji-gundai, an administrative officer as well as a local governor who managed the affairs of Kyushu region which was the territory under the direct control of the Tokugawa shogunate, had a fief of 162,000 koku. The magistrate's office was placed in Hita, Bungo Province (Hita City, Oita Prefecture). </p>
<p>The <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Tenryo (Shogunal Demesne).html">tenryo</a> (the shogunal demesne) under the responsibility of Saigokusuji-gundai was the second largest <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Tenryo (Shogunal Demesne).html">tenryo</a> among the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Tenryo (Shogunal Demesne).html">tenryo</a> in the nation. Saigokusuji-gundai was regarded as the higher position than other regular <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Gundai.html">gundai</a> because it had close relationship with tozama yuhan (outside feudal lord of powerful domain), such as the Shimazu clan, the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/family/Hosokawa clan.html">Hosokawa clan</a>, the Nabeshima clan, and the Kuroda clan. Since their job was to watch developments in the Kyushu domains, cooperating with Nagasaki <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Bugyo.html">bugyo</a> (Nagasaki magistrate), they were also known as "Kyushu <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Tandai.html">Tandai</a>" (local feudal commissioner). </p>
