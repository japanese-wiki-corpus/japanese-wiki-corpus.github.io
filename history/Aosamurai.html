<h1>Aosamurai (青侍)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Aosamurai were <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> warriors who served domestic governing institution of nobles and court nobles. </p>
<p>It is considered to be a synonym of 'Namazamurai', which appeared in "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Okagami (The Great Mirror).html">Okagami</a>" (Great Mirror; a historical tale), and in diaries such as "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Chuyuki.html">Chuyuki</a>" (The Diary of a Court Official) and "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Meigetsuki (The Record of the Clear Moon).html">Meigetsuki</a>" (Chronicle of the Bright Moon), and stories such as "Konjaku <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Monogatari.html">monogatari</a> shu" (Tales of a Time Now Past), "Kokon chomon ju" (A collection of Tales Heard, Past and Present), "Heike <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Monogatari.html">monogatari</a>" (Tale of the Heike), and "Ujishui <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Monogatari.html">monogatari</a>" (Tales of the Uji Collection). </p>
<p>The position first appeared in around the 11th century when the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> rank system was created, and it fulfilled the role of serving the household institution of court nobles, however, it ranked under <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shodaibu (aristocracy lower than Kugyo).html">Shodaibu</a> (aristocracy lower than <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kugyo.html">Kugyo</a>) who would raise to Shii (Fourth Rank) or Goi (Fifth Rank), mainly placed at Rokui (Sixth Rank) (rarely, some rose to Goi). It is believed that the word 'Aozamurai' originated from the fact that costumes for those at Rokui rank were of hanada (medium blue); besides, based on the connotations of blue, that is to say "immature," 'Aozamurai' also meant a young or low ranking <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a>. </p>
<p>In the late Medieval period, with the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Mandokoro.html">mandokoro</a> (Administrative Office) and Ie no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Tsukasa (a rank in government offices).html">tsukasa</a> (house steward) system that constituted <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Mandokoro.html">mandokoro</a> being broken up by the court, those of the court nobles at the level of vassals were to be reassigned to retainers, mainly including <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shodaibu (aristocracy lower than Kugyo).html">shodaibu</a> and Aozamurai; however, the court nobles at the lower and middle levels who could not have vassals at <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shodaibu (aristocracy lower than Kugyo).html">shodaibu</a> rank had only Aozamurai constituting their vassals and managing their households, whereas Aozamurai and vassals were treated as synonyms in some cases (according to "Noritoki Kyo ki" [The Diary of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Noritoki YAMASHINA.html">Noritoki YAMASHINA</a>]). It was known that, in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Sengoku Period (period of warring states) (Japan).html">Sengoku Period</a> (Period of Warring States), when the Emperor or Sekkan (regents and advisers) was to issue hosho paper (edict paper) to make a command regarding low ranked people, the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Benkan (Collective name of posts in Daijokan).html">benkan</a> (Council of State) who received the order commanded his own Aozamurai to issue the hosho paper, which was called Aozamurai hosho (according to the diaries "Chikanaga Kyo ki" [The Diary of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Chikanaga KANROJI.html">Chikanaga KANROJI</a>], "Nobutane Kyo ki [The Diary of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Nobutane NAKANOMIKADO.html">Nobutane NAKANOMIKADO</a>] and "Sanetaka ko ki" [The Diary of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Sanetaka SANJONISHI.html">Sanetaka SANJONISHI</a>]). </p>
