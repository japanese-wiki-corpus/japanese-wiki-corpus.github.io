<h1>Hennentai (a descriptive method of history) (編年体)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>"Hennentai" is one of descriptive methods of history, whereby historical affairs are described in chronological order. On the otherhand, "Kidentai" is a way to describe historical information about any individual or country independently. </p>
<p>Except "Nihonshoki" (Chronicle of Japan), Rikkokushi (Japan's six national histories) were written by its typical descriptive style called "Kokushitai." Kokushitai is regarded as a kind of Hennentai style, since it is basically written in the Hennentai method and contains a series of biographies along with a necrology of each major figure. </p>
