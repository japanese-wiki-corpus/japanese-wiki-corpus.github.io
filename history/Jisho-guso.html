<h1>Jisho-guso (常照愚草)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Jisho-guso is a Yusoku kojitsu (court and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> rules of ceremony and etiquette) written by Sadamichi ISE, the military governor of Yamashiro Province in the early <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Sengoku Period (period of warring states) (Japan).html">Sengoku Period</a> (the Period of Warring States) in Japan. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Josho.html">Josho</a> is the Buddhist name of Sadamichi given after he had become a priest. </p>
<p>Sadamichi was Mandokoro <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shitsuji.html">Shitsuji</a> (chief of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Mandokoro.html">Mandokoro</a>, the Administrative Board) of Muromachi <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>) from 1490 through 1498. It is not clear when Sadamichi wrote the book; however, he wrote it in 1521 or earlier as he died at the age of 59 in that year. </p>
<p>The book provides a guide to manners and systems of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> family in the Muromachi <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a><br/>
The book also describes negotiation between the nobles and soldiers in detail because he was responsible to conduct negotiations with the Imperial Court as Mandokoro <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shitsuji.html">Shitsuji</a> as well as the military governor of Yamashiro Province. </p>
