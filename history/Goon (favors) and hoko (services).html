	<div class="fb-like" data-href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Goon (favors) and hoko (services).html" data-width="" data-layout="button_count" data-action="like" data-size="small" data-share="true"></div>

<p></p>
<p>Goon and hoko indicate factors and concepts that constituted master-servant relationships among <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> during medieval Japan. The master-servant relationships among <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> during the medieval period were not one-sided but were established based upon mutually beneficial ones in which benefits were not only given by a master and received by his servant, but also given by a servant and received by the master. Here, the benefits a master gave his servant was called goon, and the benefits given by his servant to the master hoko. The relationships of 'goon and hoko' had been formed gradually among <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> class during the middle to the latter half era of the Heian period. However, it was after <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Yoritomo.html">MINAMOTO no Yoritomo</a> became the leader of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> in the Kanto area, or Kamakura-dono (lord of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a>), that the relationships of 'goon and hoko' were firmly established. After that, the relationships of 'goon and hoko' continued functioning as a base for establishing the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>), and were inherited by the later Muromachi <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Edo bakufu.html">Edo bakufu</a> as well. </p>

<p><h3>Goon</h3>
</p>
<p>Specifically, goon indicated that a master guaranteed control of an area by his servant or that a master awarded an area newly to his servant. The former benefit was called honryoando and the latter sinonkyuyo. When the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> was established, the benefit of honryoando or sinonkyuyo, or that of goon, was given by Kamakura-dono to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Gokenin.html">gokenin</a> (immediate vassals of the shogunate) in the form that Kamakura-dono appointed them to jito (the managers and lords of manors). <h3>Hoko</h3>
</p>
<p>Hoko specifically indicated the military role that a servant should play for his master and the economical burden that the servant should bear for his master. When the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> was established, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Gokenin.html">gokenin</a> played, for the Kamakura-dono, the economical roles as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a>, called Kanto-mikuji, in addition to the services of military roles, such as military roles in emergency, the Oban-yaku role for guarding the imperial court and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>, the Ikoku keigo ban-yaku role (the role for guarding against attacks from foreign countries) and the Nagato keigo ban-yaku role (also the role for guarding against attacks from foreign countries at a station placed in Nagato, present Yamaguchi Prefecture). <h3>History</h3>
</p>
<p>Around the tenth century during the Heian period when a large social change occurred, the Imperial court abandoned the policy of entrusting tax-collecting affairs and military affairs solely to the central government system and promoted to entrust these affairs to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kokushi.html">kokushi</a> (provincial governors) or rich persons, or, in other words, to introduce the kanshiukeoi-sei system. In particular, in the Kanto region where fighting occurred frequently, local rich persons or powerful clans had come to bear public military burdens. Under such situations, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> groups formed being centered in the Kanto region, and in such a group, the master took top position and led his servants called <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Ienoko (Follower).html">Ienoko</a> or roto. A factor that enabled connecting a master with his servants in such a situation was the relationship between goon and hoko. A master and his servants formed a certain union (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> group) by establishing mutually beneficial relationships called goon and hoko. However, the master-servant relationship was rather loose, and it often happened that a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> served more than one master or established a master-servant relationship with a master only temporarily. </p>
<p>Towards the end of the Heian period when the position heading all <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> in the Kanto region, called Kamakura-dono, was introduced, the master-servant relationship based on goon and hoko gradually became exclusive (not allowed to have any master other than the kamakura-dono) and permanent, making the relationship stronger. Thereafter, goon and hoko functioned as a basic factor constituting <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> society that continued until the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Meiji Restoration (Meiji-ishin).html">Meiji Restoration</a>. </p>
<p>By the way, concerning the master-servant relationship based on goon and hoko, there is an opinion that the relationship is interpreted the same as the feudal master-servant relationship, because when it is compared with feudalism found in Medieval Europe, there are some common points. On the other hand, another opinion has been proposed that the master-servant relationship is specific to Japan, being fundamentally different from that found in European feudalism. </p>
