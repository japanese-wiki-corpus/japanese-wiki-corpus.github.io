<h1>Rinjikyu (臨時給)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Rinjikyu was provisional payment of extra nenkan (a regular nenkan means: a right granted as a stipend to members of the Imperial Family [including the emperor], consorts of the emperor, some court nobles, and so forth to nominate a person for a certain government post conferred to them on the occasion of the annual installation of them as government officials). </p>
<p>The custom had been observed from the mid Heian period: at first, it was limited to the government posts at the rank of hangan (inspector [third highest of the four administrative ranks of the ritsuryo period]) and below in order to support Imperial Princes and consorts financially; later it was extended to Daijo Tenno (retired emperors), Sangu (the Empress, the Dowager Empress, the Grand Dowager Empress), and ministers (however, it was limited to jo [secretary of provincial offices] and Otoneri [royal attendant] among ministers), and the government posts granted were also extended to gon no kami (provisional governor) and suke (provincial governor) other than hangan. This was because, since the applicants for sakan (kokushi) and shisho (a person doing miscellaneous duties concerning documents) of the regular nenkan decreased, rinjikyu was devised to cope with the shortage of ninryo (fee for getting an official rank) income. Many of the applicants for hangan and bukan (military officer) of kyokan (an official of the Capital) were samurai (warriors) and lower-ranking government officials. </p>
