<h1>Takashina Clan (the clan of which the first son of Emperor Tenmu, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Prince Takechi (Takechi no Miko).html">Prince Takechi</a> [Takechi no Miko] was the ancestor) (高階氏)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Takashina clan is the clan of which the first son of Emperor Tenmu, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Prince Takechi (Takechi no Miko).html">Prince Takechi</a>, was the ancestor. </p>
<p>Summary<br/>
When Conspiracy of Nagayao occurred, Prince Isobe, a son of Prince Kuwata [Kuwata no Miko] who killed himself with his father <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Prince Nagaya.html">Prince Nagaya</a> (his mother <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Minabe no Himemiko.html">Minabe no Himemiko</a>), was spared his life and Prince Mineo, a grandson of Prince Isobe became subjects of the state to be granted the hereditary title of TAKASHINA <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Mahito.html">Mahito</a> in 844. <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Prince Asukabe.html">Prince Asukabe</a> who was a paternal half-brother of Prince Kuwata (his mother was <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/FUJIWARA no Nagako.html">FUJIWARA no Nagako</a>, a daughter of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/FUJIWARA no Fuhito.html">FUJIWARA no Fuhito</a>) and some others were also granted the hereditary title of TAKASHIMA no <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Mahito.html">Mahito</a>; however, each lineage ended at early stage. </p>
<p>Mineo became Ise no Gon no kami (Provisional Governor of Ise Province) and served <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/building/Saigu (a vestal virgin princess serving at the Ise-jingu Shrine and her residence).html">Saigu</a> (Imperial Princess appointed to serve the deities of the Ise-jingu Shrine), Imperial Princess Tenshi (also known as <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Imperial Princess Yasuko.html">Imperial Princess Yasuko</a>). According to some people, Mineo adopted a boy named TAKASHIMA no Morohisa, who was born between the Imperial Princess and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/ARIWARA no Narihira.html">ARIWARA no Narihira</a> by adultery, and had him succeed Mineo. People of the Takashina clan came to refrain from going and worshipping at Ise-jingu Shrine afterward. However, some people consistently think this 'Moronao being illegitimate child' theory is absolutely groundless. </p>
<p>At the time of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/TAKASHINA no Naritada.html">TAKASHINA no Naritada</a>, when his daughter TAKASHINA no <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Kishi.html">Kishi</a> became the legal wife of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/FUJIWARA no Michitaka.html">FUJIWARA no Michitaka</a> and bore a daughter <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/FUJIWARA no Teishi.html">FUJIWARA no Teishi</a>, who later became the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Chugu.html">chugu</a> (the second consort of an emperor) of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Ichijo.html">Emperor Ichijo</a>, the Takashina clan enjoyed sudden prosperity. However, enthronement of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Imperial Prince Atsuyasu.html">Imperial Prince Atsuyasu</a> whom Teishi bore was interfered by <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/FUJIWARA no Michinaga.html">FUJIWARA no Michinaga</a> and the descendants of Naritada fell along with the Nakanokanpaku family. The advice of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/FUJIWARA no Yukinari.html">FUJIWARA no Yukinari</a> that the enthronement of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Imperial Prince Atsuyasu.html">Imperial Prince Atsuyasu</a>, to whom blood of the Takashina clan was flown, would cause the anger of Ise-Jingu Shrine, was strong trigger for it. </p>
<p>The lineage of Naritada's younger brother TAKASHINA no Toshitada approached Michinaga, and built power as <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Zuryo (The Head of The Provincial Governors).html">zuryo</a> (provincial governor). The representative people in this lineage include TAKASHINA no Nariakira who was called Yoku-daini (Senior Assistant Governor General of desire), TAKASHINA no Tameie and his son TAKASHINA no Tameakira who executed construction of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Hossho-ji Temple.html">Hossho-ji Temple</a> as a trusted vassals of the Cloistered Emperor <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Shirakawa (the surroundings of the old capital, Kyoto).html">Shirakawa</a>. During the period when the Cloistered <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Goshirakawa.html">Emperor Goshirakawa</a> was in power, the close adviser <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/TAKASHINA no Yasutsune.html">TAKASHINA no Yasutsune</a> of the ministry of the Treasury, a favorite mistress <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/TAKASHINA no Eishi.html">TAKASHINA no Eishi</a> were active. After them, the clan didn't have influential people then fell to obscurity; after TAKASHINA no Hirotsune in the period of the Northern and Southern Courts in Japan, no court nobles came from the Takashina clan. However, as a <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> family, the clan has been very prosperous; for example, the Ko clan who has been the steward of the Ashikaga family for generations came from the Takashina clan. KO no Muronao who was the steward of Muromachi <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>) and Yoshiharu HORIO who served <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Nobunaga ODA.html">Nobunaga ODA</a> and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI.html">Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI</a> and became <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> (Japanese feudal lord) were to be said the descendant of the Takashina clan. </p>
