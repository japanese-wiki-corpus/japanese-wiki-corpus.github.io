<h1>Fushimiban (伏見版)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Fushimiban are block printed books printed at the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Enko-ji Temple.html">Enko-ji Temple</a> (now Ichijoji, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Sakyo Ward.html">Sakyo Ward</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>), which was established on a corner of the Fushimi School in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Fushimi Ward.html">Fushimi Ward</a> of Yamashiro Province by order of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Ieyasu TOKUGAWA.html">Ieyasu TOKUGAWA</a> in the early Edo period. They are also called Enko-ji ban. </p>
<p>The ninth head of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/school/Ashikaga School.html">Ashikaga School</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Genkitsu SANYO.html">Genkitsu SANYO</a>, was invited to establish the Fushimi School. </p>
<p>Genkitsu first published "Koshi-kego" (a chronicle of the sayings and doings of Confucius and his disciples), "Rikuto," and "Sanryaku" (ancient Chinese strategy books) in 1599. </p>
<p>In 1600, Jotai SAISHO published "Joganseiyo" (a book written about <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Taiso.html">Taiso</a>, the second Emperor of the Tang Dynasty in China). </p>
<p>In 1605 Jotai SAISHO also published "Azuma kagami" (a chronicle of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> from 1180 to 1266) and "Shueki" (the first book in China written in the Zhou Dynasty period) were published. </p>
<p>In 1606 Genkitsu published the "Bukei-shichisho" (seven classical strategy books of China). The number of books published in this period was 8 titles, a total of 80 books. </p>
<p>In 1612, after the founding father Genkitsu died, the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Enko-ji Temple.html">Enko-ji Temple</a>, belonging to the Rinzai Sect, was moved to within the premises of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Shokoku-ji Temple.html">Shokoku-ji Temple</a> and afterwards was relocated to the Shugakuin Village, Otagi County during 1661 to 1673. </p>
<p>According to the description in 'Enkoji-yuishogaki' (a book written about the history of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Enko-ji Temple.html">Enko-ji Temple</a>), the wooden type used for Fushimiban was given by Ieyasu. To this day, some of the wooden face is still known as the Enko-ji Temple Typeface, and can be found within the temple. However, in 1815 Mitsuru MINAGAWA borrowed the type to print his father's last work ("Kien-bunshu" (Kien writings, Kien is Mitsuru's father)) and added more type to compensate for missing ones. Therefore there are two types of characters. </p>
