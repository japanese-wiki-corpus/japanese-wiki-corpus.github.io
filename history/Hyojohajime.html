<h1>Hyojohajime (評定始)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Hyojohajime was a ceremony held by an influential house of medieval Japan conducted at the first consultation in the New Year. </p>
<p><h3>Hyojohajime of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>)</h3>
</p>
<p>Hyojohajime of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> was conducted at the New Year and at the first consultation that convened <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Hyojoshu (government post).html">hyojoshu</a> (the members of the Council of State) after a seii taishogun (lieterally, "great general who subdues the barbarians") assumed the post. <h3>The <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a></h3>
</p>
<p>Important policies had been decided by the council since 1225 when the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Hyojoshu (government post).html">hyojoshu</a> was set up in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>, and in the late thirteenth century, hyojohajime began as a New Year ceremony convened with a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Regent.html">regent</a>, rensho (assistant to regents), and other subordinates on a day of mid-January every year. After the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> passed his decision concerning three issues on the agenda such as divine services in the New Year which was recited by a bugyonin (a magistrate), and the sankon (three trays of drink and food) ceremony was conducted. <h3>The Muromachi <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a></h3>
</p>
<p>This ritual, along with the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Hyojoshu (government post).html">hyojoshu</a>, was inherited by the Muromachi <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>. On January 11 (old calendar) (since the late Oei era) every year, hyojohajime was conducted through the convening of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kanrei.html">kanrei</a> (shogunal deputies) and their subordinates with more ritual formalities than in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period: <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yuhitsu.html">yuhitsu</a> (an amanuensis) appointed by bugyonin gave a speech of auspiciousness; <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kanrei.html">kanrei</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Hyojoshu (government post).html">hyojoshu</a> offered a sword to the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a>, and the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> also granted them swords. Also, since <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshimitsu ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshimitsu ASHIKAGA</a>'s rein, the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> decided on most state affairs by having discussions in gozensata (the formal consultation) where he could take the initiative, rather than in hyojo where <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kanrei.html">kanrei</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Hyojoshu (government post).html">hyojoshu</a> held too much influence against him, so gozensata-hajime (the first gozensata in the New Year) was held as the first work of State in the New Year after having a ritual hyojohajime, which only existed in name after the Onin war. <h3>Hyojohajime in the period of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Insei.html">Insei</a> (the cloister government)</h3>
</p>
<p>In the period of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Insei.html">Insei</a>, the Retired <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Gosaga.html">Emperor Gosaga</a> began inhyojo (consultation under the cloister government) in 1246 adopting the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>'s practice, and also held hyojohajime. The oldest hyojohajime in record was in 1263. The first hyojohajime after the start of the new government of a retired emperor was called 'Fudonohajime' (文殿始) in particular, which is of special note because it marked the start of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Insei.html">Insei</a> in the era of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Ryoto (a formal dress for ancient military officers).html">ryoto</a> tetsuritsu (alternate accedence from two ancestries of imperial families) when it was not easy to keep <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Insei.html">Insei</a>. Although it was still held in the period of the Northern and Southern Courts, hyojohajime of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Insei.html">Insei</a> became only a name at the end of the 14th century when the Muromachi <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> took over the government function of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Insei.html">Insei</a>. <h3>Hyojohajime of Buddhist temples</h3>
</p>
<p>Daishu (a group of monks) were convened to hold hyojo to decide important matters in and around a temple, and hyojohajime was one of the ceremonies of the temple in the New Year. </p>
