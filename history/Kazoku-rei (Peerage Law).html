<h1>Kazoku-rei (Peerage Law) (華族令)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The Kazoku-rei was a Japanese act. There were the Imperial Household Ministry Notice Mugo (unnumbered) enacted in 1884 and the Koshitsu-rei (the Imperial Families' Act) which took place of the abolished former Notice in 1907. The Kazoku-rei enacted in 1907 (the Imperial Families' Act Notice No.2, 1947) was abolished in 1947. </p>
<p>Summary<br/>
The peerage was divided into five classes: duke, marquis, count, viscount and baron, in descending order of rank. Kugyo (high court nobles) and daimyo (feudal lords) were given noble titles according to their family status and deeds of valor, and people who had rendered distinguished services to the state were also raised to the peerage. According to Kizokuin-rei (the House of Peers Act) in 1889, the privilege of entering the House of Peers was accorded to all the dukes and marquises aged 30 and over, and others who were elected by mutual vote. </p>
<p>The act was abolished by the Matter on the Abolishment of the Koshitsu-rei and the Attached Act (the Imperial Families' Act No.12, 1947) in May 1947. </p>
