<h1>Buke Shohatto (code of warrior households). (武家諸法度)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Buke Shohatto refers to the code by which Edo bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun) governed the territorial lords during the Edo period. </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>Ieyasu TOKUGAWA, a member of the Gotairo (Council of Five Elders) of the Toyotomi government, was appointed Seii Taishogun (literally, "great general who subdues the barbarians") after the Battle of Sekigahara in 1600 and began to establish the Edo bakufu in Edo. </p>
<p>Buke Shohatto consisted of the three articles of written oath which the Edo bakufu ordered territorial lords to write in 1611, plus ten articles written by Konchiin Suden which were added later, and in July 1615 Hidetada TOKUGAWA, the second shogun, issued it to territorial lords in Fushimi-jo Castle (it is also commonly known as 'Genna rei' (Genna code)). </p>
<p>The code was aimed at daimyo (Japanese feudal lords) and the vassals of Tokugawa Family and originally had thirteen articles, but was revised on the shogun's replacement, and Iemitsu TOKUGAWA, the third shogun, added the system of Sankin-kotai (Daimyo's biennial residence in Edo), the ban on building large ships etc. so they finalised version contained nineteen articles ('Kanei rei' (Kanei code)). Tsunayoshi TOKUGAWA, the fifth shogun, integrated it into the code for shoshi (retainers) and enacted the 'Tenna rei' (Tenna code). </p>
<p>Later, Yoshimune TOKUGAWA, the eighth shogun, abolished the 'Shotoku rei' (Shotoku code) enacted by Ienobu TOKUGAWA, the sixth shogun. In fact, it had been revised by Hakuseki ARAI and as Ietsugu TOKUGAWA died young it continued to be used as it was. Yoshimune announced that 'Tenna rei' would remain in place for eternity and after that, revisions of Buke Shohatto were stopped. </p>
<p>The code was seen as the most important Bakufu Law as it was created by the enactment of the shogun's direct order, and mainly consisted of codes of order and prohibition for regulating daimyo. <h3>The Shogun and drafter at the time of promulgation</h3>
