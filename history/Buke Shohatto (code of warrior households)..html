<h1>Buke Shohatto (code of warrior households). (武家諸法度)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Buke Shohatto refers to the code by which <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Edo bakufu.html">Edo bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>) governed the territorial lords during the Edo period. </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p><a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Ieyasu TOKUGAWA.html">Ieyasu TOKUGAWA</a>, a member of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Gotairo (five administrators in Toyotomi regime).html">Gotairo</a> (Council of Five Elders) of the Toyotomi government, was appointed <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Seii Taishogun.html">Seii Taishogun</a> (literally, "great general who subdues the barbarians") after the Battle of Sekigahara in 1600 and began to establish the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Edo bakufu.html">Edo bakufu</a> in Edo. </p>
<p>Buke Shohatto consisted of the three articles of written oath which the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Edo bakufu.html">Edo bakufu</a> ordered territorial lords to write in 1611, plus ten articles written by Konchiin <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Suden.html">Suden</a> which were added later, and in July 1615 <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Hidetada TOKUGAWA.html">Hidetada TOKUGAWA</a>, the second <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>, issued it to territorial lords in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/building/Fushimi-jo Castle.html">Fushimi-jo Castle</a> (it is also commonly known as 'Genna rei' (Genna code)). </p>
<p>The code was aimed at <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> (Japanese feudal lords) and the vassals of Tokugawa Family and originally had thirteen articles, but was revised on the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>'s replacement, and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Iemitsu TOKUGAWA.html">Iemitsu TOKUGAWA</a>, the third <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>, added the system of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Sankin-kotai (daimyos alternate-year residence in Edo).html">Sankin-kotai</a> (<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Daimyo.html">Daimyo</a>'s biennial residence in Edo), the ban on building large ships etc. so they finalised version contained nineteen articles ('Kanei rei' (Kanei code)). <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Tsunayoshi TOKUGAWA.html">Tsunayoshi TOKUGAWA</a>, the fifth <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>, integrated it into the code for shoshi (retainers) and enacted the 'Tenna rei' (Tenna code). </p>
<p>Later, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Yoshimune TOKUGAWA.html">Yoshimune TOKUGAWA</a>, the eighth <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>, abolished the 'Shotoku rei' (Shotoku code) enacted by <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Ienobu TOKUGAWA.html">Ienobu TOKUGAWA</a>, the sixth <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>. In fact, it had been revised by Hakuseki ARAI and as <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Ietsugu TOKUGAWA.html">Ietsugu TOKUGAWA</a> died young it continued to be used as it was. Yoshimune announced that 'Tenna rei' would remain in place for eternity and after that, revisions of Buke Shohatto were stopped. </p>
<p>The code was seen as the most important Bakufu Law as it was created by the enactment of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>'s direct order, and mainly consisted of codes of order and prohibition for regulating <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a>. <h3>The <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> and drafter at the time of promulgation</h3>
