<h1>Hata <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Bugyo.html">bugyo</a> (flag magistrate) (旗奉行)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Hata <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Bugyo.html">bugyo</a> (flag magistrate) was one of organizations in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Edo bakufu.html">Edo bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>). It played a role in taking charge of hatasashi-mono (battle flags) on the battlefield. </p>
<p>When the headquarters of army of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Ieyasu TOKUGAWA.html">Ieyasu TOKUGAWA</a> was attacked by the squad of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Nobushige SANADA.html">Nobushige SANADA</a> in the Siege of Osaka, the Hata <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Bugyo.html">Bugyo</a> ended in failure, which was strictly questioned by Ieyasu. An anecdote is told about this, however, that <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Tadataka OKUBO.html">Tadataka OKUBO</a> strongly insisted that the flag was never fallen, because he worried that if it was revealed that the failure of Hata <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Bugyo.html">bugyo</a> was attributable to failure of Ieyasu who left such an important post as Hata <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Bugyo.html">bugyo</a> to newcomers by neglecting senior fudaishu (hereditary <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a>), no opportunity would be left for old-age Ieyasu to clear such dishonor. </p>
