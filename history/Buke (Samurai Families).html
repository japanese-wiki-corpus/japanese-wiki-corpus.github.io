<h1>Buke (Samurai Families) (武家)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The word "buke" refers to the collection of various powers which support the authority of a <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>), and this word sometimes also refers to a <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun family.html">Shogun family</a> or general <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a>. </p>
<p>Explanations<br/>
In the society of the nobility of the middle Heian period, the trend of the "succession of family business" rapidly became popular, and only specific families began to occupy certain government official posts or occupations. On the other hand, lower-ranked nobles whose function was to be skilled in the military arts had also developed their own family characteristics specialized in the military arts, and such families were called "tsuwamono no ie" (literally, "soldier family"). Subsequently, some of such families began to play a key role as the military elite at the dawn of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a>. It is said that people began to use the terms 'buke,' 'buyu no ie' (a house of heroes), and 'bumon' (a <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> clan) in order to refer to those lineages or families. These terms also implied lineages who served the Imperial Family (or an emperor) with their military power and bravery. After the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> was established in the eastern part of Japan, the term "buke" came to mean the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> and Kamakura-dono (the lord of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a>). </p>
<p>This reflected the fact that the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> and Kamakura-dono (<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/MINAMOTO no Yoritomo.html">MINAMOTO no Yoritomo</a>) promised to serve the Imperial Court with their military power and the Imperial Court officially approved the military-police authority of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> and Kamakura-dono in return. Once people became accustomed to referring to the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> as buke, another new word 'kuge,' which was a general term representing civil officials at the Imperial Court, appeared. The use of these two terms was based on the comparison of their services to the Imperial Family, namely "kuge" in charge of general government affairs and "buke" in charge of military affairs. In the beginning of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period, the Imperial Court had called the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> buke or Kanto (derived from the "Kanto region"), but once the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> installed <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Rokuhara Tandai (an administrative and judicial agency in Rokuhara, Kyoto).html">Rokuhara Tandai</a> (an administrative and judicial agency in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Rokuhara.html">Rokuhara</a>, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>) in order to monitor the Imperial Court after the Jokyu War, the term "buke" came to indicate <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Rokuhara Tandai (an administrative and judicial agency in Rokuhara, Kyoto).html">Rokuhara Tandai</a> only, while the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> was simply called Kanto. </p>
<p>Among ordinary people, however, the term "buke" came to be commonly used to address the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>, their various agencies, and their authority. Furthermore, the term also came to encompass <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Gokenin.html">gokenin</a> (immediate vassals of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> in the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> and Muromachi periods) who were regarded as the rank and file of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> that enforced the influence of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>. In the Muromachi period, the term "buke" indicated the Muromachi <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> and the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun family.html">Shogun family</a>, while in the Edo period, the term came to cover not only the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> and the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun family.html">Shogun family</a> but also various <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> (Japanese feudal lords) and high-ranked <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a>. </p>
<p>It is believed that people except for <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a>, namely peasants and townsmen, referred to all <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> as buke. During the Edo period, Imperial posts assigned to buke such as <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> were regarded as ingai-kan (supernumerary positions), and these positions had nothing to do with traditional posts given to kuge even if they had the same post names; additionally, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> at these positions were excluded from the prescribed number of personnel of such traditional posts. Therefore, such "Imperial posts" were rather very nominal ones used for the purpose of ranking. </p>
<p>It is thought that such posts were often used without approval of the Imperial Court. 
<br/>(For more details, please refer to Buke-Kani (Official Court Titles for <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Samurai.html">Samurai</a>.)<br/>
</p>
<p>A post which could be allotted to a certain buke was strictly specified according to the rank of that <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a>. This ranking system was used by the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Edo bakufu.html">Edo bakufu</a> to maintain its bakuhan taisei (feudal system characteristic of the shogunate). </p>
