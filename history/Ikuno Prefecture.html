<h1>Ikuno Prefecture (生野県)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Ikuno Prefecture was a prefecture that was established in 1869. It was abolished because of the unification of prefectures in 1871. </p>
<p>In 1868, places dominated by Kumihama or Ikuno magistrate's office in the five provinces of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Tango (the Boys Festival).html">Tango</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Tanba (train).html">Tanba</a>, Tajima, Harima and Mimasaka, and the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Hatamoto (direct retainers of shogun).html">Hatamoto</a> domain in Tajima and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Tanba (train).html">Tanba</a> were already consolidated into <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kumihama Prefecture.html">Kumihama Prefecture</a>, but as separatist movements grew in places dominated by Ikuno magistrate's office, Tajima (except a part of it), Harima, and Mimasaka areas were separated and consolidated into Ikuno Prefecture. At that time, the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Hatamoto (direct retainers of shogun).html">Hatamoto</a> domain in Harima Province and a part of the outlands of the domain were incorporated into Ikuno Prefecture. </p>
<p>The prefectural government was located at the former Ikuno magistrate's office (Asago City, Hyogo Prefecture). </p>
<p>Under the policy of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Haihan-chiken (abolition of feudal domains and establishment of prefectures).html">Haihan-chiken</a> (abolition of feudal domains and establishment of prefectures), former domains became prefectures, therefore there were a lot of overlooked lands. In order to solve the problem, a consolidation of prefectures was carried out in late 1871. The whole of Tajima, Harima and Mimasaka Province were consolidated into <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Toyooka Prefecture.html">Toyooka Prefecture</a>, Himeji Prefecture and Hojo Prefecture, respectively, and Ikuno Prefecture was abolished. </p>
