<h1><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Jisha honjoryo (lands of temples and nobles).html">Jisha honjoryo</a> no koto (寺社本所領事)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>"<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Jisha honjoryo (lands of temples and nobles).html">Jisha honjoryo</a> no koto" was a law enforced by the Muromachi <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>) on July 10, 1368. It was also called Oan no taiho (an important legislation in the Oan era) and Oan no hanzeirei (an Oan era hanzeirei (law allowing military governors to collect half of the taxes from manors and domains as military funds to protect them)). </p>
<p><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Jisha honjoryo (lands of temples and nobles).html">Jisha honjoryo</a> no koto was formulated at the first <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Hyojohajime.html">hyojohajime</a> (a ceremony within the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> conducted at the first held conference gathering of government officials on New Year's day or at the inauguration of a new <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>) after the inauguration of the third <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Seii Taishogun.html">Seii Taishogun</a> (literally, "great general who subdues the barbarians") of the Muromachi <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshimitsu ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshimitsu ASHIKAGA</a>. It was regarded as a law that established standard policies on territorial litigation of the Muromachi <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> as well as a law that drew the line on the Hanzeirei of the past. Therefore, a clear distinction could be made between this law and the former series of hanzeirei (order allowing military governors to collect half of the taxes from manors and demesnes as military fund). </p>
<p><h3>Background</h3>
</p>
<p>In the year before the enactment of the law on December 25, 1367, the second <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshiakira ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshiakira ASHIKAGA</a> fell critically ill. This lead to his ten year old legitimate son, Yoshimitsu, succeeding the head of the family with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoriyuki HOSOKAWA.html">Yoriyuki HOSOKAWA</a> being appointed as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kanrei.html">Kanrei</a> (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a>'s Deputy) to look after him. Even after Yoshimitsu had gone through his <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Genpuku (celebrate ones coming of age).html">genpuku</a> (coming-of-age ceremony) early the next year, all practical aspects of the administration were covered by Yoriyuki. These conditions lasted until Yoshimitsu reached the age of 18 years old in 1375 (although it was not until the Koryaku Coup that direct administration of Yoshimitsu was instituted both nominally and virtually). </p>
<p>Immediately following the establishment of the law, a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Migyosho.html">Migyosho</a> was issued to the Omi Shugoshiki (provincial constable of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Omi Province.html">Omi Province</a>) Rokkaku Ujiyori where it was mentioned that the law had been accompanied by imperial sanction authorized by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Gokogon.html">Emperor Gokogon</a> of the Northern Court (Japan). The law can be said to be unique due to the fact that it was ratified in the form of an imperial sanction by the Emperor that was ordered by the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (The word 'taiho' is also said to imply the meaning, 'a significant law enacted by both the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> and the Imperial Court'). <h3>Contents</h3>
</p>
<p>The law repealed <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Hanzei (Half Payment of Taxes).html">hanzei</a> that had been implemented on territories owned by the Emperor, the Retired Emperor and Sekken-ke (families which produced the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Regent.html">Regent</a> and the Chief Adviser to the Emperor) as well as on <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ichien Chigyo.html">Ichien Chigyo</a> territories (lands of nobles that were managed by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Honjo (proprietor or guarantor of manor).html">honjo</a> (proprietor of a manor) with full title) with a temple or shrine for a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Honjo (proprietor or guarantor of manor).html">honjo</a>. In exchange, the law required full payment of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Nengu (Land Tax).html">nengu</a> (land tax). Territories in other various districts owned by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Honjo (proprietor or guarantor of manor).html">honjo</a> were divided in half between a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Honjo (proprietor or guarantor of manor).html">honjo</a>'s zassho (a person in charge of miscellaneous tasks) and an azukarinin (person left in charge of one's belongings, etc.) of a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> family that had occupied the territory taking advantage of Hanzeirei (This could be virtually regarded as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shitaji chubun.html">Shitaji chubun</a>, which means a "physical division of the land"). If an azukarinin disobeyed the law and seized more than half of the territory, they were punished severely and forced to return the entire territory back to the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Honjo (proprietor or guarantor of manor).html">honjo</a>. However, if it was land managed by a commoner who had borrowed the name of a noble, even if it was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ichien Chigyo.html">Ichien Chigyo</a> territory, the annulment of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Hanzei (Half Payment of Taxes).html">hanzei</a> did not apply. Whether it was either <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ichien Chigyo.html">Ichien Chigyo</a> territory that was to be subjected to the repeal or territory in which <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Hanzei (Half Payment of Taxes).html">hanzei</a> continued to be officially implemented, half of the land was to be immediately handed over to a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Honjo (proprietor or guarantor of manor).html">honjo</a>'s zassho. </p>
<p>Regardless of the provisions of the law, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Hanzei (Half Payment of Taxes).html">hanzei</a> was not to be applied to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ichien Chigyo.html">Ichien Chigyo</a> territory that had not been subjected to Hanzeirei up to that time. </p>
<p>Within <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ichien Chigyo.html">Ichien Chigyo</a> territories with a temple or shrine as a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Honjo (proprietor or guarantor of manor).html">honjo</a>, there were a number of territories in which the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> approved the implementation of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Hanzei (Half Payment of Taxes).html">hanzei</a> by mistake. These territories were to be divided in half, each part owned by the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Honjo (proprietor or guarantor of manor).html">honjo</a> and the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> family respectively until the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> could find alternative territories. </p>
<p>In some cases, the Jito occupying a territory of a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Honjo (proprietor or guarantor of manor).html">honjo</a> was not a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> family, but a Kuge (court noble) who was given the position of Jitoshiki (manager and lord of a manor) as a reward by the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> for meritorious service<br/>
When this happened, in contrast to other common territories where the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Honjo (proprietor or guarantor of manor).html">honjo</a> was a Kuge acting as the lord of a manor, the Kuge was obliged to follow the provisions of the law in the same manner as a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> family playing the role of Jito. <h3>Explanation</h3>
</p>
<p>During this period, the Muromachi <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> was facing a critical situation in its conflict with the Southern Court (Japan) even though the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> was still an infant. The Muromachi <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> made attempts at getting over the crisis by developing stronger partnerships with temples and shrines, influential families such as the Sekken-ke and the Northern Court (Japan), which it had been supporting. While this law was categorized as a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Hanzei (Half Payment of Taxes).html">hanzei</a> law, its contents demonstrated policies concerning territories of the Muromachi <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> as well as the attitude toward litigation on the inside and outside of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>. </p>
<p>The Hanzeirei was enforced in order to secure provisions for the army under the long-lasting conflict with the Northern and Southern Courts. As a repercussion, however, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> families, such as the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a>, were effectively seizing land in various districts, including <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shoen.html">Shoen</a>. As a result, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Honjo (proprietor or guarantor of manor).html">honjo</a>, such as those living in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, became unable to receive <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Nengu (Land Tax).html">nengu</a>. In order to put an end to a situation where territories were seized by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> families for long periods of time, the law ordered a division of the territories between the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Honjo (proprietor or guarantor of manor).html">honjo</a> and the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> families, causing <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Honjo (proprietor or guarantor of manor).html">honjo</a> to lose half of their territories. This caused the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Honjo (proprietor or guarantor of manor).html">honjo</a> to lose the half of their territories. The <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> obtained an imperial sanction in order to eliminate resistance of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Honjo (proprietor or guarantor of manor).html">honjo</a> consisting of traditionally influential families, such as Kuge. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">Samurai</a> families who had occupied territories and monopolized income from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Nengu (Land Tax).html">nengu</a>, on the other hand, were obliged to contribute half of their income to the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Honjo (proprietor or guarantor of manor).html">honjo</a> without question in exchange for official approval of their supremacy over the remaining half of their territories. In effect, the law reduced the income from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Nengu (Land Tax).html">nengu</a> for <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> families by half. In response, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> families, supported by their military power, did not accept <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shitaji chubun.html">Shitaji chubun</a> (a physical division of the land) and refused to return territory that had originally belonged to temples, shrines and Kuge, setting aside the Imperial Court's territories. It was for this reason that the law is considered to have been largely ineffective. </p>
<p>Additionally, in contrast to the former series of Hanzeirei which defined their time frame as 'this year's crop' and enforced in areas deemed 'provinces in a state of war,' this law defined the time frame as 'for the time being' and the areas as 'various districts.'<br/>
This provided the legal grounds to authorize and perpetuate the usurpation of territories and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Hanzei (Half Payment of Taxes).html">hanzei</a> that had been enforced by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a> in various regions on the pretext of war without approval from the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>. Accordingly, the law facilitated the establishment of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shugo-ryogoku system.html">Shugo-ryogoku system</a> (the system where a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a> dominate a manor) by the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> families (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a>). Furthermore, the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> did not show an assertive attitude toward searching for alternative territories (to be found by the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> to compensate for its mismanagement of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Hanzei (Half Payment of Taxes).html">hanzei</a> as mentioned above), despite the regulation it created to do so. Consequently, the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Hanzei (Half Payment of Taxes).html">hanzei</a> that continued to be implemented on these territories persisted, in spite of the fact that it was a temporary measure. </p>
<p>Among the goals in the enactment of this law, the following points can be regarded as more significant than others: First, the basic principles of administration of territories and the basic approach toward litigation over territories were established by the Muromachi <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>, resulting in the de facto recognition of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shugo-ryogoku system.html">Shugo-ryogoku system</a>; second, the relationships with the Imperial family and Sekkan-ke, both of which were exempt from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Hanzei (Half Payment of Taxes).html">hanzei</a> by this law, were strengthened, clearing the way for Yoshimitsu to rule over the Imperial Court and the Retired Emperor in later years. </p>
