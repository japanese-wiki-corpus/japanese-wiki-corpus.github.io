<h1>Flake (剥片)</h1>
<p>Flake is a thin piece of stone removed from ore by percussion. Since ore (called country rock) is generally large and thick, it is not suitable for making small stone tools, therefore, flakes were often made first then made into stone tools (mainly chipped stone tools). The stone tools made in this way are specifically called flake stone tools. Flake stone tools include useful tools such as flint arrowheads and stone knives. </p>
