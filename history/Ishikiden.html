<h1>Ishikiden (一色田)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Isshikiden is a rice field that is required to pay only one type (Isshiki) of tax. </p>
<p>For <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Myoden.html">myoden</a>, it meant rice fields that only had to pay <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kanmotsu.html">Kanmotsu</a> (tribute goods paid as taxes or tithes) or Kuji (public duties), but in this case, Kuji that was to be paid to the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> (manor) owner was exempt and Isshikiden that had to pay <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kanmotsu.html">Kanmotsu</a> to the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kokuga (provincial government office compounds).html">Kokuga</a> were the majority (because <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shoen.html">Shoen</a> owners did not have the authority to make exemptions for <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kanmotsu.html">Kanmotsu</a>). </p>
<p>There are various Japanese place names with 'Isshiki' derived from Isshikiden (refer to Isshiki) and the Isshiki clan known as a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shugo daimyo.html">Shugo daimyo</a> (Japanese territorial lord as provincial constable) originally came from a family based in Mikawa Province, Kira no sho Isshiki (present Isshiki Town, Hazu County, Aichi Prefecture). </p>
