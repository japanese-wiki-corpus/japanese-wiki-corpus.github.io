<h1>The Franco-Japanese treaty (日仏協約)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The Franco-Japanese treaty is a treaty concluded in Paris between Japan and France on June 10, 1907. </p>
<p>It was signed by the Japanese ambassador to France, Shinichiro KURINO and French Foreign Minister, Stephin PICHON and insured profit and safety in Asia for both countries. According to the treaty, France agreed to give Japan exclusive favors, and in return Japan would recognize France's authority over Indochina and committed to cracking down on the independence movement (also called the Donzu movement) by Vietnamese students within Japan. The countries also guaranteed the independence of Qing, while at the same time recognizing each other's authority over different provinces within it. Through this treaty, both countries agreed to recognize France's authority over Guangdong, Guanxi and Yunnan Province, and Japan's authority over Manchuria and Menggu, and Fujian Province, the latter through a confidential agreement. When France leaked the contents of the treaty to the media to deal with congress and to boost public opinion, there was an outcry from the Qing dynasty. Japan also concluded the Japanese-Russian Treaty in the same year and joined the Triple Entente. The treaty was declared void when Japenese troops entered and were stationed in French-occupied Indochina. </p>
