<h1>Shuki-daiban (vermilion-lacquered household goods that were the Fujiwara clan's treasures) (朱器台盤)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Shuki-daiban are vermilion-lacquered household goods succeeded as the Fujiwara clan's treasures by successive <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Toshi choja.html">Toshi choja</a> (head of the Fujiwara clan). They were used at New Year's banquet held by ministers (the Fujiwara clan in this case). </p>
<p>It is noted from several records that shuki (vermilion-lacquered dishes and drinking vessels) for grand banquets were stored in four nagabitsu (long wooden box with a lid) and there were 27 daiban (low and rectangular table on which food was served, used by nobles in the Heian period) to place shuki, including five large daiban. </p>
<p>According to the tradition, they were contributed to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Kangakuin.html">Kangakuin</a> (educational institution) by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Fuyutsugu.html">FUJIWARA no Fuyutsugu</a> and possessed by successive <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Toshi choja.html">Toshi choja</a> who doubled as betto (chief officer) of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Kangakuin.html">Kangakuin</a> for generations. But their first confirmed appearance in written records is after the time of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Kaneie.html">FUJIWARA no Kaneie</a> and the first transfer of Shuki-daiban ('Shuki watari no gi' [Ceremony for the transfer of Shuki]) to be held on the occasion of the change of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Toshi choja.html">Toshi choja</a> at Higashi Sanjo-dono Palace did not take place until the time of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Morozane.html">FUJIWARA no Morozane</a>. There is a well-known historical event that, when <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Tadazane.html">FUJIWARA no Tadazane</a> disowned his eldest son <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Tadamichi.html">FUJIWARA no Tadamichi</a>, who was Kanpaku (chief adviser to the Emperor) in 1150 and designated his second son <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Yorinaga.html">FUJIWARA no Yorinaga</a> as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Toshi choja.html">Toshi choja</a>, Tadazane ordered <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> to transfer Shuki-daiban to Yorinaga by force. </p>
<p>But grand banquets ceased to be held due to the decline of court functions, and in addition, Shuki-daiban seem to have been scattered and lost due to successive conflicts and changes of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Toshi choja.html">Toshi choja</a> within a short period of time caused by the formation of Gosekke (five top Fujiwara families whose members were eligible for the positions of Sessho [<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Regent.html">regent</a>] and Kanpaku), and when Michitsugu KONOE assumed the post of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Toshi choja.html">Toshi choja</a> in 1361, 'Shuki watari no gi' no longer took place, which suggests that Shuki-daiban had already been lost before that time. </p>
