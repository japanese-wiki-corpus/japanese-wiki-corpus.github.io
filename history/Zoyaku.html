<h1>Zoyaku (雑役)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Zoyaku (Zoeki) is the term for the taxation system introduced after the middle of the Heian period. </p>
<p>Whereas <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kanmotsu.html">Kanmotsu</a> (tribute goods paid as taxes or tithes) and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Nengu (Land Tax).html">Nengu</a> (land tax) are considered as the transformation of the tax, So (rice tax) of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ritsuryo.html">Ritsuryo</a> system (a system of centralized government based on the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ritsuryo.html">ritsuryo</a> code), Zoyaku indicated Zokuji (all miscellaneous dues in the form of non-rice products and labor), <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Buyaku.html">Buyaku</a> (labor service), Rinji Zoyaku (extraordinary irregular levies) that are considered as a continuance of a per-capita tax, Zoyo (irregular corvee) (regarding what the taxes of Yo [labor or alternative goods] and Cho [textile goods or alternative money] transformed into, there are two theories: one theory asserts <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kanmotsu.html">Kanmotsu</a> and another Zoyaku). There were <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Koden.html">koden</a> (field administered directly by a ruler) and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> (manor in medieval Japan) that applied to the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kokushi.html">Kokushi</a> in advance to be exempt from Zoyaku. This was called <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Zoyakumen.html">Zoyakumen</a> (exemption of Zoyaku). Originally it was a tax on prominent citizens, but with the establishment of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kanmotsu.html">Kanmotsu</a> rippo (the law fixing the tax rate of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kanmotsu.html">kanmotsu</a>, tribute) in the middle of the 11h century, it transformed into a tax against land. </p>
