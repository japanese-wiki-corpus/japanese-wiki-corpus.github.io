<p>Ryoke is a term used in the context of Japanese <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> (manor in medieval Japan) to represent a lord of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a>, donated by Kaihatsu-ryoshu (local notables who actually developed the land). Powerful central nobility, temples, and shrines that were donated <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> became ryoke. </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>In the mid-Heian period, from the late 10th century to the 11th century, farmland development and their privatization by Tato, local powerful farmers, had been accelerated. The owners of those developed farmlands were called Kaihatsu-ryoshu. However, their status of land possession actually lacked legal foundation and was therefore quite unstable, with a high possibility of confiscation of their lands by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kokuga (provincial government office compounds).html">kokuga</a> (provincial government offices). Consequently, many Kaihatsu-ryoshu tried to retain their dominion and the right to manage <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> by donating their <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> to the powerful central nobility, temples, and shrines. Those who were donated <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> in this situation were called ryoke. </p>
<p>At that time, Manor Regulation Acts were often ordered by a 'new government' upon the change of the emperors, and also in many cases, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kokuga (provincial government office compounds).html">kokuga</a> did not authorize the ownership of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> and incorporated them into <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kokugaryo.html">Kokugaryo</a> (territories governed by provincial government office). Sometimes, the authority of ryoke alone was not enough to maintain their possession of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a>. To cope with this situation, some ryoke would donate their <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> to more authoritative bodies like the Imperial family or Sekkan-ke (the families which produced regents). The lord of the manor on the top of this hierarchy was called <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Honke.html">honke</a> (head family). Specifically, the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Honke.html">honke</a> and ryoke who had effective dominion of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> were called <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Honjo (proprietor or guarantor of manor).html">Honjo</a>. In some cases, other nobility who were granted part of the rights and profits of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Honjo (proprietor or guarantor of manor).html">honjo</a> regarding <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> were called ryoke. </p>
<p>Ryoke appointed Kaihatsu-ryoshu as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shokan.html">shokan</a> (an officer governing <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a>) to play the role of local managers. Through those <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shokan.html">shokan</a>, ryoke collected harvests from their <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Nengu (Land Tax).html">nengu</a> (land tax), and imposed labor service (kuji [public duties]) on the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shomin.html">shomin</a> (farmers living in their manor), taking those taxes as their own revenue. If they had <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Honke.html">honke</a>, they delivered some of the revenue to their <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Honke.html">honke</a>. Since ryoke mostly resided in the central areas, when disputes or trouble erupted in local areas, ryoke usually had <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shokan.html">shokan</a> deal with them, or dispatched an envoy called <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Onshi.html">onshi</a> to solve the situation. In later eras, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shokan.html">shokan</a> began to work like <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a>, and in some cases in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period, some <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shokan.html">shokan</a> were even appointed as jito (manager and lord of manor) by the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>). Gradually, these armed <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shokan.html">shokan</a> had come to disregard ryoke, encroaching their dominion. At the beginning of the Muromachi period, the introduction of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Hanzei (Half Payment of Taxes).html">hanzei</a> system (the system where the Muromachi <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> allowed military governors or <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a> to collect half of the taxes from manors and demesnes as military funds) further encroached on ryoke's vested interests. Eventually, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> were demised by taiko <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kenchi.html">kenchi</a> (the cadastral surveys conducted by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI.html">Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI</a>), leading to extinction of the position of ryoke as well. </p>
