<h1>Jun fudai <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> (quasi fudai <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a>) (準譜代大名)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>A quasi fudai <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> refers to some tozama <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> (outsider to the ruler) clans, who became treated as fudai <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> clans (relative or very close to the ruler), mainly in regards to the blood relations to the ruling family of the Edo period in Japan, mainly because of their the clans' achievement over the time. This name came to be used later for convenience, so those clans were not called with this name at the time of the Edo period. The correct term is a negai fudai (a fudai clan who requested the government to be a fudai), or a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> that is pursuant to a fudai <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a>. </p>
