<p>Uchi-daka (real value of the yield) means <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kokudaka (The Figure Of Land Productivity).html">kokudaka</a> (crop yield) that was used as the appraisal standard to impose <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Nengu (Land Tax).html">nengu</a> (land tax) to the people of shoryo (territory) of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> (Japanese feudal lord) and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Hatamoto (direct retainers of shogun).html">hatamoto</a> (bannermen) in the Edo period. It is a term opposed to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Omote-daka (face value of kokudaka assessed by the feudal government).html">omote-daka</a>, which is the face value of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kokudaka (The Figure Of Land Productivity).html">kokudaka</a> assessed by seii taishogun (literally, "great general who subdues the barbarians"), and is also called jitsu-daka. </p>
<p><h3>Detailed Explanation</h3>
</p>
<p><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Omote-daka (face value of kokudaka assessed by the feudal government).html">Omote-daka</a> was calculated based on the land survey officially recognized by the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Edo bakufu.html">Edo bakufu</a>; however, in many domains the actual uchi-daka was higher than <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Omote-daka (face value of kokudaka assessed by the feudal government).html">omote-daka</a> and also increasing, thanks to the progress of development of new field in 17th century, the land survey within domains that was based on the increased productivity by innovation of agricultural technique (farming equipments, fertilizer), and tax reform by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Monopolization.html">monopolization</a> of indigenous products. </p>
<p>Generally, for many <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Taihan.html">taihan</a> (large scale domain) of tozama (outside feudal lord) that experienced few relocation throughout the Edo period and which shoryo was not distributed, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Omote-daka (face value of kokudaka assessed by the feudal government).html">omote-daka</a> was still the same amount as calculated by Taiko <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kenchi.html">kenchi</a> (Hideyoshi Toyotomi's nationwide land survey) or land survey in the early Edo period, despite that large scale of development of new field had been conducted, and as a result, some areas like Ou, where originally was underdeveloped area, there was a big difference between <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Omote-daka (face value of kokudaka assessed by the feudal government).html">omote-daka</a> and uchi-daka, for example, the Sendai Domain's <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Omote-daka (face value of kokudaka assessed by the feudal government).html">omote-daka</a> was 620 thousands koku crop yield while its uchi-daka was one million koku. </p>
<p>In fact, although <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>) investigated uchi-daka and they kept the track of it to some degree, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Omote-daka (face value of kokudaka assessed by the feudal government).html">omote-daka</a> was still used as the standards for calculating kakaku (family status) and military service that would determine compulsory expenditure of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> (Japanese feudal lord) or <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Hatamoto (direct retainers of shogun).html">hatamoto</a>. For this reason, the more uchi-daka becomes higher than <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Omote-daka (face value of kokudaka assessed by the feudal government).html">omote-daka</a>, the less <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> or <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Hatamoto (direct retainers of shogun).html">hatamoto</a> will need to pay for military service, compared to their actual income, and therefore they will become more wealthy. </p>
<p>However, if uchi-daka was increased as a result of land survey by the domain, it meant that <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Nengu (Land Tax).html">nengu</a> will be increased in accordance with the productivity - although it was previously collected at comparatively low rate for the actual productivity - and the load of the people of the domain will also be increased. Especially for tozama clans that experienced a large diminishing of the territory had been conducting strict land survey to calculate uchi-daka in order to increase their income and maintain the vassals. It is said that tozama clans tried to set the grade of their land as high as possible, and for example, the Choshu Domain of the Mori clan's uchi-daka was about 750 thousands koku compared to 360 thousands koku. Sometimes uchi-daka registered in the land survey list was higher than the actual productivity of the land, and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Nengu (Land Tax).html">nengu</a> was calculated based on that uchi-daka, which resulted in harsh tax collection. In the Satsuma Domain of the Shimazu clan, tax was collected based on the land survey list that even included the land not suitable for rice fields and vegetable fields. </p>
<p>In the Edo period, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> (excluding <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Taihan.html">taihan</a> of tozama) often experienced transfers of the territories, and although <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Omote-daka (face value of kokudaka assessed by the feudal government).html">omote-daka</a> was supposed to be the same, transfer could be a promotion to the double amount of uchi-daka or a demotion to the half amount (for example, the Naito clan was demoted from the Iwakitaira Domain to the Nobeoka Domain of Hyuga Province). In addition, in some cases if the promotion/increase was made under the patronage of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>, the officially published <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Omote-daka (face value of kokudaka assessed by the feudal government).html">omote-daka</a> was intentionally kept low (for example, the Makino clan was promoted from the Yoita Domain of Echigo clan to the Komoro Domain in Shinano Province). </p>
<p>Thus, it was impossible to estimate financial affairs of domains by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Omote-daka (face value of kokudaka assessed by the feudal government).html">omote-daka</a>, and uchi-daka was the important factor. It can be said that in order to understand the actual power of domains, comprehensive judgment is required based on whether there are good ports or mines, the distance of Sankinkotai (a system under which feudal lords in the Edo period were required to spend every other year in residence in Edo), tax collection according to the development of commerce, and so on. </p>
