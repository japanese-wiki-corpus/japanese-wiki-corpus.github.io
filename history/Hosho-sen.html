<h1>Hosho-sen (奉書船)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>A hosho-sen was a ship carrying not only a shuinjo (license for foreign trade) issued by the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Seii Taishogun.html">Seii Taishogun</a> (literally, "great general who subdues the barbarians") but also a hosho (permit) written by roju (members of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>'s council of elders). </p>
<p>Originally a hosho was a monjo (document), formed by senior vassals or magistrates, in order to certify orders issued by lords were formal and to instruct their prompt execution; in the Muromachi <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> a hosho was made by kanryo (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a>'s Deputies) together with Shougun's order, the system of which was succeeded by the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Edo bakufu.html">Edo bakufu</a>. </p>
<p>In the early Edo period, foreign trade was performed by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shuinsen (shogunate-licensed trading ship).html">shuinsen</a> carrying a shuinjo (shogunal charter for foreign trade). Hoshosen regulations permitted foreign trade only to ships carrying a hosho countersigned by the roju, in addition to a traditional shuinjo, which was a transitional measure from <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shuinsen (shogunate-licensed trading ship).html">shuinsen</a> trade to national isolation. </p>
<p>In promoting isolation, a shuinjo, namely a trade permit was an obstacle. 
<br/>The <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shuinsen (shogunate-licensed trading ship).html">shuinsen</a> regulations were institutionalized by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Ieyasu TOKUGAWA.html">Ieyasu TOKUGAWA</a>, the first <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> and many of the shuinjo were issued by Ieyasu himself, so the cancellation of shuinjo was virtually impossible<br/>
</p>
<p>Therefore, the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>, as a means of restricting trade, set a new condition for permitting trade that "both a shuinjo and a hosho should be carried ". That is to say, the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> added a collateral condition without canceling the validity of a shuinjo. </p>
<p>In 1633, carrying a hosho was made completely obligatory, leading to the extinction of a shuin-sen system. </p>
<p>Timeline<br/>
1601: <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Ieyasu TOKUGAWA.html">Ieyasu TOKUGAWA</a> gave notification of shuin-sen trade to other countries. 1631: Hosho-sen regulations came into effect. 1633: Travelling overseas other than by shuin-sen were prohibited. 1634: Overseas trade was restricted. 1635: Travelling overseas and homecoming of Japanese ships were completely banned. </p>
