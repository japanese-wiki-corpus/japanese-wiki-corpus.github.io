<h1>Hosho-sen (奉書船)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>A hosho-sen was a ship carrying not only a shuinjo (license for foreign trade) issued by the Seii Taishogun (literally, "great general who subdues the barbarians") but also a hosho (permit) written by roju (members of shogun's council of elders). </p>
<p>Originally a hosho was a monjo (document), formed by senior vassals or magistrates, in order to certify orders issued by lords were formal and to instruct their prompt execution; in the Muromachi bakufu a hosho was made by kanryo (Shogun's Deputies) together with Shougun's order, the system of which was succeeded by the Edo bakufu. </p>
<p>In the early Edo period, foreign trade was performed by shuinsen carrying a shuinjo (shogunal charter for foreign trade). Hoshosen regulations permitted foreign trade only to ships carrying a hosho countersigned by the roju, in addition to a traditional shuinjo, which was a transitional measure from shuinsen trade to national isolation. </p>
<p>In promoting isolation, a shuinjo, namely a trade permit was an obstacle. 
<br/>The shuinsen regulations were institutionalized by Ieyasu TOKUGAWA, the first Shogun and many of the shuinjo were issued by Ieyasu himself, so the cancellation of shuinjo was virtually impossible<br/>
</p>
<p>Therefore, the bakufu, as a means of restricting trade, set a new condition for permitting trade that "both a shuinjo and a hosho should be carried ". That is to say, the bakufu added a collateral condition without canceling the validity of a shuinjo. </p>
<p>In 1633, carrying a hosho was made completely obligatory, leading to the extinction of a shuin-sen system. </p>
<p>Timeline<br/>
1601: Ieyasu TOKUGAWA gave notification of shuin-sen trade to other countries. 1631: Hosho-sen regulations came into effect. 1633: Travelling overseas other than by shuin-sen were prohibited. 1634: Overseas trade was restricted. 1635: Travelling overseas and homecoming of Japanese ships were completely banned. </p>
