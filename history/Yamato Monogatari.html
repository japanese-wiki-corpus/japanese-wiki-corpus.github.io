<p><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yamato.html">Yamato</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Monogatari.html">Monogatari</a> (literally, "Tales of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yamato.html">Yamato</a>") is a story of the Middle Ages of Japan, written in the Heian period. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yamato.html">Yamato</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Monogatari.html">Monogatari</a> is an uta-monogatari (poem-tale) based on the poems composed by the members of the aristocratic society. It is presumed that this literary work had already been accomplished by about 951. From its property as an uta-monogatari, the characters in the story were often written by using their real name, official position or title or nyobo-na (name as a court lady), referring to certain existing people specifically. </p>
<p>It is believed that this literary work was influenced by "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Ise Monogatari.html">Ise Monogatari</a>" (literally, "Tales of Ise," an uta-monogatari in the mid Heian period). 
<br/>The title of this literary work '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yamato.html">Yamato</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Monogatari.html">Monogatari</a>' is also believed to have been named after '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yamato Province.html">Yamato Province</a>,' following '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Ise Monogatari.html">Ise Monogatari</a>' named after 'Ise Province.'<br/>
On the other hand, there is a theory that the title of this literary work was named after the author, a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Nyobo (a court lady).html">nyobo</a> (a court lady) named <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yamato.html">Yamato</a>. </p>
<p>Accomplishment<br/>
Accomplishment of this literary work is estimated at around 950 during the reign of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Murakami.html">Emperor Murakami</a>, in the early Heian period, following the accomplishment of "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Ise Monogatari.html">Ise Monogatari</a>." </p>

It seems that a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Nyobo (a court lady).html">nyobo</a> serving near the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Uda.html">Emperor Uda</a> was concerned with the production of this literary work, because it includes a lot of subjects on the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Uda.html">Emperor Uda</a> and his surrounding people. </p>

<p>Summary<br/>
The common accepted theory suggests that this literary work consists of 173 chapters in total. It includes about 300 poems. However, without setting a specific leading character like "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Ise Monogatari.html">Ise Monogatari</a>," this literary work collects narratives relating to waka poems and uta-monogatari consisting of a series of poems composed by real people like emperors, nobles, Buddhist priests in those days, each of which is compiled in a chapter. </p>
<p>Content and composition<br/>
The first half through the 146th chapter consists of poems composed around the period when the literary work was accomplished, as well as commentaries made by the Imperial family and nobles on the origin of those poems. The latter half consists of old folklore including poems whose theme is an encounter with others through tragic love, separation, reunion and so on, having strong characteristics of narrative elements. It includes 'a legend of Ikuta-gawa River' (the 147th chapter) with a story about a young lady who committed suicide by throwing herself into Ikuta-gawa River for taking to heart the propositions of marriage from two men, as well as 'a legend of Ubasute-yama Mountain' (the 156th chapter). </p>
<p>The literary work was strongly influenced by "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Ise Monogatari.html">Ise Monogatari</a>," which is suggested in the matter that the same story as '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Tsutsuizutsu (Curb of a Well).html">Tsutsuizutsu</a>' (curb of a well) included in "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Ise Monogatari.html">Ise Monogatari</a>" is also included in "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yamato.html">Yamato</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Monogatari.html">Monogatari</a>." </p>
<p>Furthermore, it is supposed that "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yamato.html">Yamato</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Monogatari.html">Monogatari</a>" may have some relations with "Gosen Wakashu" (selected collection of Japanese poetry) and "Mitsune's Poetry Book" compiled by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/OSHIKOCHI no Mitsune.html">OSHIKOCHI no Mitsune</a>, because some poems in these books appear in "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yamato.html">Yamato</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Monogatari.html">Monogatari</a>." </p>
