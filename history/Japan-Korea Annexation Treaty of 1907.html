<h1>Japan-Korea Annexation Treaty of 1907 (第三次日韓協約)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The Japan-Korea Annexation Treaty was a treaty concluded on July 24, 1907. </p>
<p>In retaliation of the Hague Secret Emissary Affair, on July 18, 1907, Japan made Emperor Gojong (Emperor Gwangmu) abdicate. The Korean Empire had become a protectorate of Japan under the terms of the earlier Eulsa Treaty, and had thus lost the right to conduct diplomatic exchanges with other countries. In addition to that, this new treaty gave the Japanese Resident-General the right to appoint and dismiss high-ranking officials (Article 4) and stipulated that all high-ranking officials appointed to the Korean government must be Japanese (Article 5). This brought the domestic administration of Korea fully under the control of Japan. The unpublished section of the treaty also stipulated dissolution of the Korean army, and handover of judicial and policing powers to the Japanese inspector general. </p>
