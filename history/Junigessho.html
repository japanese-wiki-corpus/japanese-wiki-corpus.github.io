<h1>Junigessho (十二月将)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Junigessho (Twelve gessho) refers to the marker that indicates the position of the sun on the ecliptic, and its signs correspond to those of the Western astrology one to one. Junitensho (Twelve symbolism) used in Rikujinshinka (Six Chinese fortune-telling based on time) are thought to have been made based on Junigessho. </p>
<p>Modern signs and one's fortune corresponding to general gessho are as follows:<br/>
</p>
<p>As the sign of the sun's position is called sun sign in the Western astrology, the god of the sun's position in twelve gods which are originally the divisions obtained by dividing the ecliptic into twelve should be called gessho, but gessho is used to mean the twelve gods in many cases. </p>
<p><h3>Difference in heresy and notation</h3>
</p>
<p>There are differences in notation on Junigessho as follows:<br/>
</p>
<p>The Chinese letters slightly or very different in appearance but same in sound are used. </p>
<p>Senji ryakketsu (the oldest existing book on yin-yan) in the material "Nihon Onmyodo-shi Sosetsu" (Japanese yin-yan history review paper) written by Shuichi MURAYAMA contains a name with a wrong letter. </p>

<p>The letters with fewer strokes are usually used in manuscript. </p>
<p>Even a letter in a name was changed in order to avoid using the same letter and sound as in Jinso (Renzong)'s name after the Northern Sung Dynasty. </p>
