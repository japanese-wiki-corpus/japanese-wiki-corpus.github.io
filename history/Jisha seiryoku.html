<p></p>
<p><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Jisha (Buddhist Temples and Shinto Shrines).html">Jisha</a> seiryoku is a term describing the military, governmental, economical and cultural power of temples and shrines (at that time considered equivalent because of syncretism of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> and Buddhism), which shared power with the military government and Imperial Court during the Japanese middle ages. It is called 'seiryoku' because there was no center of power as with the military government and Imperial Court, but each religious institution acted independently and even in one institution there were many counteracting groups. </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>From the late Heian period, large temples such as the Enryaku-ji and Kofuku-ji Temples kept monk warriors and an independent military power. They also carried the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Mikoshi (Portable shrine).html">mikoshi</a> (portable shrine) to file a direct petition and asserted their demands. </p>
<p>The temples had many laypeople called <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Shuto (salted and fermented bonito intestine).html">Shuto</a>, Jinin who made up large megalopolises surrounding temples with high economical, learning and craft-making activity called '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Keidai.html">Keidai</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Toshi (messenger from the Kamakura bakufu to the Imperial Court in Kyoto).html">toshi</a>' (temple city) in recent Japanese history studies. </p>
<p>The <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Enryaku-ji Temple.html">Enryaku-ji Temple</a> owned a large <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Keidai.html">keidai</a> (land) on the east side of the Kamo-gawa River in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> through <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Yasaka-jinja Shrine.html">Yasaka-jinja Shrine</a> that was under the control of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Enryaku-ji Temple.html">Enryaku-ji Temple</a>, and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Kofuku-ji Temple.html">Kofuku-ji Temple</a> owned most of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> (manor in medieval Japan) in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yamato Province.html">Yamato Province</a>; they had a large influence on <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> through their economic power throughout the middle ages. The Enryaku-ji and Kofuku-ji Temples were strong <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Jisha (Buddhist Temples and Shinto Shrines).html">jisha</a> seiryoku that were together called 'Nanto hokurei' (the powerful temples of Nara and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Mt. Hiei.html">Mt. Hiei</a>). </p>
<p>The lands of large temples were considered 'Muensho' where the common people who had a hard life would move in and become absorbed. The right for the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> to investigate wanted people, called 'Kendanken,' could not be enforced within large temple grounds and therefore many people who were escaping the war such as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Yoshitsune.html">MINAMOTO no Yoshitsune</a> and Emperor Godaigo sought protection under the temples. </p>
<p>At the end of the Sengoku period (period of the warring states) (Japan), <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Nobunaga ODA.html">Nobunaga ODA</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI.html">Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI</a> and others were strongly against the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Jisha (Buddhist Temples and Shinto Shrines).html">jisha</a> seiryoku and fought many vicious battles. However, they used the advanced technological skills of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Jisha (Buddhist Temples and Shinto Shrines).html">jisha</a> seiryoku, for example craftsmen from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Enryaku-ji Temple.html">Enryaku-ji Temple</a> were used to build <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Azuchi-jo Castle.html">Azuchi-jo Castle</a>, or rifles made by craftsmen from the Negoro-ji Temple were used in the battle. </p>
<p>Hideyoshi's <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Katanagari (sword hunt).html">Katanagari</a> (sword hunt) meant that not only from the farmers but also weapons owned by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Jisha (Buddhist Temples and Shinto Shrines).html">jisha</a> seiryoku were collected and this led to the disappearance of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Jisha (Buddhist Temples and Shinto Shrines).html">jisha</a> seiryoku from the power structure of Japan after 500 years of existence. <h3>Major <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Jisha (Buddhist Temples and Shinto Shrines).html">jisha</a> seiryoku</h3>
