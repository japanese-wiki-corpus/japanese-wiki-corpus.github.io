<h1>Maruko Clan (丸子氏)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Maruko (or Mariko) clan is one of the clans of the ancient Japan. </p>
<p>Summary<br/>
The family name is Muraji (Maruko Muraji)<br/>
The members were scattered in Ki Province, Shinano Province, Sagami Province and so on. It is said to be a branch family of the Otomo clan and was established by MARUKO no Tsuratari, the son of OTOMO no Nukate.
