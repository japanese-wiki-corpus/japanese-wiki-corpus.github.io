<h1>Daizenshiki (Office of the Palace Table) (大膳職)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Daizenshiki was a government office belonging to Kunaisho (Ministry of the Sovereign's Household) in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ritsuryo.html">Ritsuryo</a> system (a system of centralized government based on the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ritsuryo.html">ritsuryo</a> code) in Japan. 
<br/>The Japanese way of reading was 'okashiwade no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Tsukasa (a rank in government offices).html">tsukasa</a>.'<br/>
It was an institution which served hospitable foods to subjects in the Imperial Court. </p>
