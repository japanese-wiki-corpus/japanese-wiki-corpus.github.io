<h1>The Tokusei uprising during the Kakitsu era (嘉吉の徳政一揆)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The Tokusei uprising during the Kakitsu era was a peasant uprising to demand <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Tokuseirei.html">Tokuseirei</a> (ordering return of land sold and dissolution of debts) and occurred in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and its surroundings such as the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Omi Province.html">Omi Province</a> in 1441(the first year of the Kakitsu era). It was also called the peasant uprising of Kakitsu era. </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>In the political turmoil after the assassination of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshinori ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshinori ASHIKAGA</a> in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kakitsu War.html">Kakitsu War</a>, the farming population lead by bashaku (shipping agents who used horses) in Omi Sakamoto in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> rose up in rebellion to demand 'daihajime-no-tokusei (acts of virtuous government requested at <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> replacement)' (Tenkaichido no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Tokuseirei.html">Tokuseirei</a> (a debt cancellation order for all throughout the country)), which was directed by jizamurai (local <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a>) and lead to an uprising by tens of thousands of people. The uprisings mainly enveloped <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, but not the surrounding regions. <h3>Events leading up to the uprising</h3>
</p>
<p>June: Yoshinori was assassinated. </p>
<p>August: Bashaku in Omi rose up in rebellion, and the Rokkaku clan, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a> (provincial constable), promulgated <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Tokuseirei.html">Tokuseirei</a>. </p>
<p>September: <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/To-ji Temple.html">To-ji Temple</a> and Kitano-sha Shrine were occupied, and Tanbaguchi and Nishi-hachijo were blocked. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Enryaku-ji Temple.html">Enryaku-ji Temple</a> opposed the promulgation of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Tokuseirei.html">Tokuseirei</a>, causing bashaku in Omi ruled by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Enryaku-ji Temple.html">Enryaku-ji Temple</a> to break away from the uprising, even turning against it as the uprising further occupied <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Kiyomizu-dera Temple.html">Kiyomizu-dera Temple</a>. </p>
<p>The army of uprisers cut off communication between <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and outside areas, and then attacked sake shops, doso (pawnbrokers and moneylenders), and temples. Under the direction of the jizamurai, order was brought to the uprising forces, while robberies were monitored. </p>
<p>From the shogunate which set out to settle the situation by spreading <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Tokuseirei.html">Tokuseirei</a> exclusively for the farming population, the uprisers demanded that <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Tokuseirei.html">Tokuseirei</a> be issued throughout the country including the court nobles and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> in order to obtain support from the ruling classes. Besides, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> (Japanese territorial lord as provincial constable) who had learned that <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kanrei.html">kanrei</a> (shogunal deputy) Mochiyuki HOSOKAWA ordered that troops be dispatched to protect the doso in exchange for 1,000 kan bribe from the doso, blocked the dispatch of the troops. The situation fell into a further state of confusion. The new <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshikatsu ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshikatsu ASHIKAGA</a> accepted the demand and issued <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Tokuseirei.html">Tokuseirei</a> throughout the Yamashiro Province which ordered the return of things that had been pawned no more than 20 years prior (Order for the Acts of Virtuous Government in Kakitsu era). The Muromachi <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>) which had not issued official <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Tokuseirei.html">Tokuseirei</a> against the peasant uprising of the Shocho era was forced to issue <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Tokuseirei.html">Tokuseirei</a> this time, which significantly damaged the prestige of the government. </p>
