<h1>Edo <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (江戸幕府)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Edo <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> was a <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> government established by <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Ieyasu TOKUGAWA.html">Ieyasu TOKUGAWA</a>. It is so named because its headquarters were located in Edo (present-day Tokyo). </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>The Edo <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> was founded on March 24, 1603 when <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Ieyasu TOKUGAWA.html">Ieyasu TOKUGAWA</a> was appointed as <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Seii Taishogun.html">Seii Taishogun</a> (hereinafter <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>). On November 9, 1867, the 15th shogun Yoshinobu TOKUGAWA transferred power back to the Emperor). The Decree for the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Restoration of Imperial Rule (Japan).html">Restoration of Imperial Rule</a> on December 9, 1867 finalised the resignation of Yoshinobu as <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> and the abolishment of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>, thus the Edo <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> came to an end (although some say the end of the Edo <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> was the time of the surrender of Edo Castle in 1868). </p>
<p>Since the Tokugawa family monopolised the position of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> for generations, it is also called as the Tokugawa <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>. The 264 years of the Edo <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> are referred to as the 'Edo period' or 'Tokugawa period,' and the Tokugawa family took a significant amount of control over Japan. The Edo <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> was the last <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> government in Japanese history. <h3>The shogunate system</h3>
</p>
<p>The system of rule of the Edo <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> was called the shogunate system, in which both <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (the central government) and domain (the local government) controlled the people. <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> gave shuinjo (licenses for foreign trade) to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> (feudal lords) and guaranteed their status as feifs, while the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> formed a domain within their given feifdom and controlled it. In 1664, the Kanbuninchi was conducted, whereby shuinjo were issued to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> across the country at the same time. In lands directly controlled by the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> (<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Tenryo (Shogunal Demesne).html">tenryo</a>), local governors were appointed instead of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a>. However, the terms '<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Tenryo (Shogunal Demesne).html">tenryo</a>' and 'domain' were not used in official documents of the Edo period. These were determined as official terms after the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Meiji Restoration (Meiji-ishin).html">Meiji Restoration</a>. 
<br/>Also, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> was called as 'goki' or 'gokogi.'<br/>
The shogunate system in a broad sense ended at the time of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Haihan-chiken (abolition of feudal domains and establishment of prefectures).html">Haihan-chiken</a> (abolition of feudal domains and establishment of prefectures) in 1871. </p>
<p>Under the control of the Edo <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>, all <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> were obliged to participate in Sankinkotai (a system under which feudal lords in the Edo period were required to spend every other year in residence in Edo) and to engage in castle construction and flood prevention works. 
<br/>However, this did not include <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> of Edo Jofu - a feudal lord's retainer who remained permanently in Edo with the lord and their own family - such as the Mido domain<br/>
The Edo <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> aimed to weaken the domains by placing them under large financial burdens and not letting them revolt against the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>. </p>
<p>Under the political structure of the Edo <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>, it is considered that the country was ruled by the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> himself during the rules of the first <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Ieyasu TOKUGAWA.html">Ieyasu TOKUGAWA</a>, the second <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Hidetada TOKUGAWA.html">Hidetada TOKUGAWA</a>, the third <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Iemitsu TOKUGAWA.html">Iemitsu TOKUGAWA</a>, the fifth <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Tsunayoshi TOKUGAWA.html">Tsunayoshi TOKUGAWA</a>, the eighth <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Yoshimune TOKUGAWA.html">Yoshimune TOKUGAWA</a>, and the eleventh <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Ienari TOKUGAWA.html">Ienari TOKUGAWA</a>,<br/>
The other <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> are often considered to have left political matters to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Bakufu.html">Bakufu</a> cabinet officials, or to have merely followed the orders made by the former <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> (or his father). However, for the Tokugawa, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> and Taisho periods, this is a critical misunderstanding. Although some were more competent than others, every <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> was to at least some extent involved in politics, and it is also true that none of them acted as a complete dictator. Even under the rule of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Ieyasu TOKUGAWA.html">Ieyasu TOKUGAWA</a>, whose governance had the strongest aspects of dictatorship of all the shoguns, there were cabinet officials in the Shogunate who remonstrated against the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> and were engaged in formulation of policies. Rather than being angry, Ieyasu actually liked the vassals who remonstrated against him, and when there was a difference of opinion he would sometimes have physical fights with them. On the other hand, the third <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Iemitsu TOKUGAWA.html">Iemitsu TOKUGAWA</a> was completely different, and during the early stage of his reign, he simply followed Ogosho <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Hidetada TOKUGAWA.html">Hidetada TOKUGAWA</a>. After the death of Hidetada, Iemitsu let the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Bakufu.html">Bakufu</a> cabinet officials conduct most of the political works and people's perception that Iemitsu personally engaged in politics is said to be the result of propaganda by cabinet officials. Basically, no <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> was a complete dictator nor a complete puppet of the cabinet officials (other than when the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> was very young), and there was a system in place whereby the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> had the final say on issues discussed by cabinet officials (mainly senior councilors, "roju"). </p>
<p>The eighth <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Yoshimune TOKUGAWA.html">Yoshimune TOKUGAWA</a> conducted the largest-scale reformation of the shogunate government since its foundation, thus earning the title 'Restorer of the Edo <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>.'<br/>
<h3><a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Daimyo.html">Daimyo</a></h3>
</p>
<p><a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Daimyo.html">Daimyo</a> were classified as follows. </p>
<p><a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/family/Shinpan (Tokugawas relatives).html">Shinpan</a>, from Tokugawa clan families. </p>
<p>Fudai <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a>, who had been serving the Tokugawa clan before the Battle of Sekigahara. </p>
<p>Tozama <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a>, who began to serve the Tokugawa clan after the Battle of Sekigahara (including the Toyotomi-related <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> who fought as the East squad in the Battle of Sekigahara). </p>
<p>According to this classification, there were significant differences in the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a>'s political authority. The fact that all the important roles were taken by Fudai <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> was a particularly major shift from the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> and Muromachi periods. In the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> and Muromachi periods, major senior vassals and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a> <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> (provincial military governors, who became feudal lords) took important roles and were sometimes even stronger than the shogunal family or <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Regent.html">regent</a>. The <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Gotairo (five administrators in Toyotomi regime).html">Gotairo</a> (Council of Five Elders) system at the end of the Toyotomi government was a collective leadership system by powerful <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a>, however they were unable to prevent <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Ieyasu TOKUGAWA.html">Ieyasu TOKUGAWA</a>, a tozama <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a>, from usurping power. In contrast, in the Edo <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>, it was the fudai <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> who dominated important roles in the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>. The fudai <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a>, merely vassals to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Ieyasu TOKUGAWA.html">Ieyasu TOKUGAWA</a>, who himself had been a simple <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> under the Toyotomi government, were mainly uninfluential, small <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a>. Major <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> became tozama <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> in the Edo <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> and thus did not have a chance to take on important roles in the administration. In other words, the Edo <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> was not a dictatorship of the Tokugawa <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> himself, but a dictatorship in the framework of the Tokugawa family. Due to this fact, even if the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> was not involved in politics, he would not become a complete puppet of the cabinet officials, and equally usurping of power could be prevented. </p>
