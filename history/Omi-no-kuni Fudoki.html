<h1>Omi-no-kuni Fudoki (近江国風土記)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Omi-no-kuni Fudoki is a fudoki (Description of regional climate, culture, etc.) of the Omi Province. As it is a Itsubun (a composition previously existed but does not exist now), the contents have to be referred to the secondary sources such as "Teio Hennen ki" (the Chronicle of emperors). </p>
<p>Among the fragmentary writings, contents that are highly important include descriptions on Robe of Feathers Legend that is handed down by tradition in the Lake Yogo area in Ika County and the tradition of Chikubushima Island. </p>
