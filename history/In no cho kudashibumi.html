<h1>In no cho kudashibumi (院庁下文)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>In no cho kudashibumi were the documents issued by Incho (Retired Emperor's Office) during the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Insei.html">Insei</a> (government by cloistered emperor) during the Heian period. It took the form of Kudashibumi which were the documents cosigned by In no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Tsukasa (a rank in government offices).html">Tsukasa</a> (officials of Incho) and were given to lower agencies. It was considered more formal than <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Inzen (a decree from the retired Emperor).html">Inzen</a> (decree of cloistered emperor). </p>
<p>According to the the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ritsuryo.html">Ritsuryo</a> codes, the government's final decision was supposed to be issued as a form of Shochoku (emperor's rescript) or <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Daijokanpu.html">Daijokanpu</a> (documents issued by Department of State). However, in the later Heian period, when the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Insei.html">Insei</a> political system started, where the retired emperor took power and administered all affairs of state as a de facto emperor, it was required to establish a way to express its own political will instead of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Daijokanpu.html">Daijokanpu</a>. Therefore, In no cho kudashibumi issued by Incho that was established as the de facto government came to be treated as powerful as Shochoku and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Daijokanpu.html">Daijokanpu</a>. </p>
<p>While <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Inzen (a decree from the retired Emperor).html">Inzen</a> took the strong nature of the personal documents of the cloistered emperor and was quickly responsive and flexible, In no cho kudashibumi was to deal with important affairs, as was the case of Shochoku or <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Daijokanpu.html">Daijokanpu</a>. </p>
