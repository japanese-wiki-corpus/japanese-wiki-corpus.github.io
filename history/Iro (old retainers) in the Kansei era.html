<h1>Iro (old retainers) in the Kansei era (寛政の遺老)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Iro (old retainers) in the Kansei era refers to politicians who led the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> such as Nobuaki MATSUDAIRA (the lord of the Mikawa-Yoshida domain), who were chosen by Sadanobu MATSUDAIRA after his downfall. </p>
<p>When Sadanobu MATSUDAIRA resigned as roju (senior councilor) in 1793, Nobuaki MATSUDAIRA became the head of roju. As the shogunate <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Ienari TOKUGAWA.html">Ienari TOKUGAWA</a> was too young, the next <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> was led by roju who were hired by Sadanobu during the Kansei Reform, such as Saneakira, Ujinori TODA, Tadakazu HONDA, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Tadakiyo MAKINO.html">Tadakiyo MAKINO</a>, Sukeyoshi OTA, and Nobunari ANDO. </p>
<p>However, Saneakira died in 1817, and other roju such as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Tadakiyo MAKINO.html">Tadakiyo MAKINO</a> left <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> for the reason of old age. As a result, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> was governed by the close adviser of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Ienari TOKUGAWA.html">Ienari TOKUGAWA</a>, Tadaakira MIZUNO, however, bribes became rampant during his government; Ienari's luxury was also added to that, which unstabilized the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> government and brought about its corruption. </p>
