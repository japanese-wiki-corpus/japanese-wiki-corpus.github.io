<h1>Gobo no keiji (five edict boards) (五榜の掲示)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Gobo no keiji were five street bulletin boards erected on April 7, 1868 and the first public prohibitions published by the Meiji government. </p>
<p>Although Charter Oath of Five Articles published the day before was only shown to the court nobles and feudal lords and declared on Dajokan Nisshi (Diary of Great Councils of State) sold only in cities, Gobo no keiji was published almost throughout the country. It also inherited the policy of Edo bakufu, including the observance of the loyality to the lord and patriarch and the prohibition of the conspiracy or unrecognized religions (sects, to be specific, Christianity). On the other hand, the notice boards from the Old Shogunate era were ordered to be disposed of at the same time, which symbolized the power and sphere of control of a new government. 
<br/>(As proof of it, it can be mentioned that Gobo no keiji were destroyed in the domains of Ouetsu-reppan alliance as soon as they opened war with the new government.)<br/>
(Also, they were not published in the domains of feudal lords who supported the Shogun or direct retainers.)<br/>
</p>
<p>In effect, they were abolished at the same time as when street bulletin boards were abolished in 1873. </p>
