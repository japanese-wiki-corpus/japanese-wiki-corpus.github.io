<h1>Mokudai (目代)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Mokudai was a deputy, such as a retainer, sent to the post in behalf of an appointed provincial governor who remained at his place from mid Heian period to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period. It was also know as gandai. </p>
<p>It turned into a government official position, such as a local governor, sent in behalf of an officer who was supposed to leave the capital and work at the place. Here, the above mentioned deputy of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Yonin (steward).html">yonin</a> (remote appointments) provincial governor from the middle of the Heian period to the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period is described. </p>
<p>The mokudai as a provincial governor's private deputy existed in the Nara period. However, in the middle of the 10th century, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Zaichokanjin.html">zaichokanjin</a> (the local officials in Heian and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> periods) started to manage <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kokuga (provincial government office compounds).html">kokuga</a> (provincial government offices). More and more appointed officials did not move to ningoku (place of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Appointment (Ninkan).html">appointment</a>) and delegated to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Zaichokanjin.html">zaichokanjin</a>. It was called <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Yonin (steward).html">yonin</a> (remote appointments). A <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Yonin (steward).html">yonin</a> provincial governor sent his retainer to the place as a deputy and let him supervise the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Zaichokanjin.html">zaichokanjin</a>. This deputy was called mokudai. </p>
<p>Those who were capable with preparing official documents, etc. were appointed to the mokudai. Moreover, geki of daijokan (secretary of the grand council) might be sent by a chigyo-kokushu (provincial proprietor), an influential <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kugyo.html">kugyo</a> (top court official). However, when armed groups rose in various places in the end of the Heian period, chigyo-kokushu (provincial proprietor) and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Zuryo (The Head of The Provincial Governors).html">zuryo</a> (the head of the provincial governors) began to send those who were excellent in military affairs to confront them. The <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Zaichokanjin.html">zaichokanjin</a> dealt with tax collection, military affairs, etc. under the supervision of a mokudai in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kokuga (provincial government office compounds).html">kokuga</a>. </p>
<p>The practice disappeared with the decline of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kokugaryo.html">Kokugaryo</a> after the period of the Northern and Southern Courts (Japan), especially during the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Sengoku Period (period of warring states) (Japan).html">Sengoku Period</a> (Period of Warring States). </p>
<p><h3>Gandai in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> class</h3>
</p>
<p>Moreover, among the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> class, the local governor might be called gandai or mokudai. The article of November 22 (lunar calendar), 1256 of "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Azuma Kagami.html">Azuma Kagami</a>" (The Mirror of the East) states that 'However, they may remain gandai only in the head-of-the-family (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Tokimune HOJO.html">Tokimune HOJO</a>)'s childhood' when <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Tokiyori HOJO.html">Tokiyori HOJO</a> became a priest and handed the regency to Nagatoki HOJO. According to "Buke Myomoku-sho" (compilation of historical data of the Edo period), the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> class used gandai in order to distinguish it from court noble's mokudai. However, both mokudai and gandai were used by court nobles and the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> in actual documents. </p>
