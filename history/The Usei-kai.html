<h1>The Usei-kai (雨声会)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The Usei-kai, which lasted for three days, from June 17th (Monday) to June 19th (Wednesday), 1907, is the name given to an evening banquet held by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kinmochi SAIONJI.html">Kinmochi SAIONJI</a>, then prime minister, at his private residence in Kandasurugadai, to which he invited various Japanese literati. Note that the name "Usei-kai" (literally "rain sound party") was coined after the fact. This is said to be the first time since the start of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period that the prime minister of the entire nation invited people of letters to such an event. </p>
