<h1>Shoen Seiri-rei (orders given to consolidate manors) (荘園整理令)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Shoen Seiri-rei is a set of acts issued during the Heian period. </p>
<p>Most renowned is the Enkyu-no Shoen Seiri-rei (an order given in the Enkyu era to consolidate manors) issued in 1069 by <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Gosanjo.html">Emperor Gosanjo</a> to consolidate all manors together nationwide, but from the days of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Daigo.html">Emperor Daigo</a>, 150 years prior to this, it had been issued every time the Emperor changed. </p>
<p>An increase in the number of manors brought enormous income to powerful nobles such as sekkan-ke (<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Regent.html">regent</a> family), as well as temples and shrines under their protection, but on the other hand, tax collection by <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Kokushi.html">kokushi</a> (provincial governors) became impossible (in other words, imperial demesne decreased), causing serious harm to national finance. Thus, the purpose was to recover imperial demesne and regenerate national financing by regulating the establishment of new manors and suspending illegal ones. However, since actual government affairs were performed by sekkan-ke and powerful nobles who were also the most powerful manor lords, and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Kokushi.html">kokushi</a>, towards the end of their term, who had a tendency to approve manors by powerful nobles as a form of office-seeking activity to secure their next post, it was not very effective with many exceptional cases. </p>
<p>Therefore, in the 'Enkyu-no Shoen Seiri-rei,' for a more solid execution compared to traditional Shoen Seiri-rei, all duties that depended upon the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Kokushi.html">kokushi</a> in provinces were performed centrally. Additionally, it is noteworthy that the target manors for deregistration were extended to the territories of sekkan-ke. Furthermore, unlike traditional orders, detailed regulations were added. </p>
<p>Fields within manors that were low quality could not be exchanged, without notice, for fertile fields administered directly by a ruler. </p>
<p>Fields administered directly by a ruler, where the resident of the manor is cultivating outside the manor, cannot be included in a manor. </p>
<p>Fields administered directly by a ruler that <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Kokushi.html">kokushi</a> allocate to temples or shrines as a means of generating a source of revenue to defray expenses cannot be treated as manors (muteitsubotsukisho) without permission. </p>
<p>Seiri-rei in those times are said to have relatively had accomplishments, partly because of the disorder in response due to feud within the sekkan-ke. </p>
<p>However, when <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Insei.html">insei</a> (rule by a retired emperor) began, manors concentrated around the retired emperor, who was virtually at the top of the Imperial court; for example, despite efforts at regulation by Emperor <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Shirakawa (the surroundings of the old capital, Kyoto).html">Shirakawa</a> and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Toba.html">Emperor Toba</a>, such a contradiction caused the manor consolidation agenda to fail. </p>
