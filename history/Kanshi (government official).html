<h1>Kanshi (government official) (官司)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kanshi is an authority or a government official in ancient Japan. </p>
<p>The prototype of kanshi in Japan is thought to be an organization in which several <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Tomonomiyatsuko (the chief of various departments at the Imperial Court).html">Tomonomiyatsuko</a> (chiefs of various departments at the Imperial Court) shared the affairs of public administration of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yamato.html">Yamato</a> dynasty, mobilized and managed their Benotami (officers and people serving the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yamato.html">Yamato</a> dynasty) in order to perform duties. Later, an organization of government officials (hito-sei) that managed Benotami and performed practical work of administration was formed under tomo no miyatsuko (Servant of the Court administering a group). </p>
<p>After the Taika Reforms, organizations of officials under the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ritsuryo.html">ritsuryo</a> system, such as shitokan-sei (the fundamental structure of the bureaucracy system of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ritsuryo.html">ritsuryo</a> system), were formed instead of benotami-sei, but they were not completed until after the establishment of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Taiho Ritsuryo (Taiho Code).html">Taiho Ritsuryo</a>. Unlike in Tang Dynasty, however, highly systemized control systems among officials were not formed, and there existed <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Honkan.html">honkan</a>, who had independent authorities in spite of being under each ministry, and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Ryoge no kan (class outside of the Ritsuryo system).html">Ryoge no kan</a>, which was newly established outside the framework of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ritsuryo.html">ritsuryo</a> system. </p>
