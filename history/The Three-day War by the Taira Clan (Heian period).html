<p></p>
<p>The Three-day War by the Taira Clan was one of the domestic conflicts which occurred in the Jisho-Juei War during the late Heian period. The incident was an uprising from August to September of 1184 by the remnants of the Taira clan, who had been hiding in Iga Province or Ise Province since the Taira clan's flight from <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> in the previous year. </p>
<p>It was referred to as the 'Three-day War by the Taira Clan' in "<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Heike Monogatari (The tale of the Heike).html">Heike Monogatari</a>" (The tale of the Heike), but it was the incident of Three-day War by the Taira Clan (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period) in 1204, 20 years later, which was really suppressed in three days and was originally called 'Three-day War by the Taira Clan,' while this rebellion by the Taira clan in 1184 was a major one. </p>
<p><h3>Course of events</h3>
</p>
<p>Even after the Taira clan escaped to Saigoku (the western part of Japan) in July 1183, men of the Taira clan lived over wide areas of both Iga and Ise Provinces, which had been their home territory, so <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Koreyoshi OUCHI.html">Koreyoshi OUCHI</a> was assigned as Ise <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a> (military governor of Ise) and Saneharu OI, a vassal in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Musashi Province.html">Musashi Province</a>, was dispatched to Ise to subdue the Taira clan and their retainers there in April 1184. When a rebellion headed by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/TAIRA no Ietsugu.html">TAIRA no Ietsugu</a> broke out around 8:00 PM of August 21, 1184, many of Koreyoshi's retainers were killed in the attack. At the same time, also in Ise, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/TAIRA no Nobukane.html">TAIRA no Nobukane</a> and his followers blocked off Mt. Suzuka by cutting down trees and rose in revolt, which was said to upset the whole In ("<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Gyokuyo.html">Gyokuyo</a>" (The Diary of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Kanezane KUJO.html">Kanezane KUJO</a>) the article of August 22, 1184). </p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> army (government army) fought remnants of the Taira clan in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Ohara (Kyoto City).html">Ohara</a> no sho, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Omi Province.html">Omi Province</a>, on September 2. Ietsugu was defeated and his head put on public display, while TOMITA no Iesuke, Ieyoshi and Iekiyo Nyudo, who were Samurai Daishos (commander of warriors), were defeated and killed. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/TAIRA no Nobukane.html">TAIRA no Nobukane</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/FUJIWARA no Tadakiyo.html">FUJIWARA no Tadakiyo</a> disappeared, covering their tracks. Although the rebellion was all but subdued, the Minamoto clan also suffered enormous damages, including the deaths in battle of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Hideyoshi SASAKI.html">Hideyoshi SASAKI</a>, an old general, and as many as several hundred horsemen. </p>
<p>On September 16, taking the matter seriously, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Yoritomo.html">MINAMOTO no Yoritomo</a> ordered <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Yoshitsune.html">MINAMOTO no Yoshitsune</a> to find <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/TAIRA no Nobukane.html">TAIRA no Nobukane</a>, who was the dominant figure of the Taira clan. </p>
<p>On September 23, Nobukane's three sons, TAIRA no Kanehira, TAIRA no Nobuhira and TAIRA no Kanetoki, were summoned to Yoshitsune's residence in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and were put to the sword or forced to commit suicide. Two days after that, Yoshitsune sortied to put down Nobukane ("<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Sankaiki.html">Sankaiki</a>" (The Diary by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Tadachika NAKAYAMA.html">Tadachika NAKAYAMA</a>) the article of September 23). There is no record in the diaries written by nobles about the subsequent course of the battle, but according to "Genpei Seisui Ki" (Rise and Fall of the Minamoto and the Taira clans), after a fierce battle, about 100 horsemen on the Nobukane side that holed up in the castle of Takino, Ise Province were defeated and killed. </p>
<p>Yoshitsune was appointed as Saemon no <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Shojo.html">shojo</a> (Junior Lieutenant of the Left Division of Outer Palace Guards), <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kebiishi (police and judicial chief).html">Kebiishi</a> (officials with judicial and police powers) by the Cloistered <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Goshirakawa.html">Emperor Goshirakawa</a> on September 19, while he was in the midst of putting down <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/TAIRA no Nobukane.html">TAIRA no Nobukane</a>. </p>
<p>A report from Yoshitsune stating that he had summoned Nobukane's three sons to his accommodation and killed them and that Nobukane had been dismissed from Dewa no kuni <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kokushi.html">Kokushi</a> (the governor of Dewa Province) reached <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> on October 9, and on October 22 a letter was sent out from Yoritomoto to put the land of Nobukane and the men of the Taira clan in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> under Yoshitsune's control ("<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Azuma Kagami.html">Azuma Kagami</a>" (The Mirror of the East)). </p>
<p><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/FUJIWARA no Tadakiyo.html">FUJIWARA no Tadakiyo</a> remained in hiding and continued to threaten the capital until the following year, 1185. After the Battle of Ichinotani, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Noriyori.html">MINAMOTO no Noriyori</a> and the main body of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> warriors had returned to the East, but on September 21, in the midst of this rebellion, Noriyori again left <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> and, on October 22, headed from <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> for Saikai (the provinces on the western seacoast) to search out and kill the Taira clan. The remnants of the Taira clan made the capital so fearful that Goshirakawain prevented Yoshitsune's sortie to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Yashima (Noh play).html">Yashima</a> in January of the following year to maintain security, and this perturbed situation was what caused the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Appointment (Ninkan).html">appointment</a> of Yoshitsune to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kebiishi (police and judicial chief).html">Kebiishi</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Saemon no jo (Government Post).html">Saemon no jo</a> (Lieutenant of the Left Division of Outer Palace Guards). According to recent studies, it is thought that Yoshitsune was dismissed from the army to search out and kill the Taira clan not because Yoritomo resented the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Appointment (Ninkan).html">appointment</a> of Yoshitsune without his permission (as described in "<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Azuma Kagami.html">Azuma Kagami</a>," which was compiled in later years), but because Yoshitsune was needed to maintain the security of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and the Cloistered Emperor and nobles were strongly against it. </p>
<p>In addition, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/TAIRA no Nobukane.html">TAIRA no Nobukane</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/TAIRA no Ietsugu.html">TAIRA no Ietsugu</a> were <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> in the imperial capital who had collaborated to aid Yoshitsune's entrance to the capital for the purpose of defeating <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Yoshinaka.html">MINAMOTO no Yoshinaka</a>. According to "<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Azuma Kagami.html">Azuma Kagami</a>," Nobukane's sons were responsible for the incident, but from the fact that they went to Yoshitsune's residence, they seem not to have been deeply involved in the rebellion. It is thought that Yoritomo's policy of excluding or subordinating the independent <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> in the imperial capital was the reason which underlay the hunt for Nobukane. </p>
