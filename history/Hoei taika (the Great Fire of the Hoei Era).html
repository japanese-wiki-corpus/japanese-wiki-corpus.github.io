<h1>Hoei taika (the Great Fire of the Hoei Era) (宝永大火)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Hoei taika (the Great Fire of the Hoei Era) refers to a fire that occurred in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> on April 28, 1708. </p>
<p>A fire that started from the house of Zeniya Ichibee (a money exchange shop) at Sanjo agaru on Aburakoji-dori Street, spread its damages, fed by the south-westerly wind, to Kinri gosho (Imperial Palace), Sento Imperial Palace, Nyoin Gosho (Empress Dowager's Palace), and Togu Gosho (Crown Prince's Palace), as well as to the mansions of nobles such as the Kujo Family and the Takatsukasa Family, temples, and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Machiya (Merchant House).html">machiya</a> town houses. Centering on the area of Kamigyo (Upper <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>), which is surrounded by Aburakoji-dori Street on the west, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Imadegawa-dori Street.html">Imadegawa-dori Street</a> on the north, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Kawaramachi-dori Street.html">Kawaramachi-dori Street</a> on the east, and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Nishikikoji-dori Street.html">Nishikikoji-dori Street</a> on the south, the fire burned down 417 cho blocks, 10351 households, temples, and shrines including <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Bukko-ji Temple.html">Bukko-ji Temple</a> and Shimogamo-jinja Shrine. </p>
<p>After the fire, there was a satirical poem posted around the city, which read: "Looking around, I see how even the city of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> was turned into countryside./A spring even-fall visits our temporary abode made of reed" ("Genroku Hoei Chinwa" (Comical Stories from the Eras of Genroku and Hoei)). A part of the cho blocks and some houses were relocated to the suburbs such as east of the Kamo-gawa River (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> prefecture) and Uchino after the fire, which led to the urban expansion of the city of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. </p>
