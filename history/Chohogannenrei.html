<h1>Chohogannenrei (長保元年令)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Chohogannenrei is the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Daijokanpu.html">Daijokanpu</a> (official document of the Daijokan, the office of the supreme political leader) issued as <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Shinsei (Law reconstitution).html">shinsei</a> (a code of new law) on September 9, 999. It consists of eleven clauses. </p>
<p>While the oldest <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Shinsei (Law reconstitution).html">shinsei</a> is considered to have been issued in 947, Chohogannenrei is the first law which contains all of the three fundamental elements of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Shinsei (Law reconstitution).html">shinsei</a> in the Middle Ages: "(<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a>) shrines and (Buddhist) temples," "kasateishi (prohibition of the luxury beyond one's means or position)" and "strict enforcement of government affairs." </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p><a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/The Imperial Court.html">The Imperial Court</a>, annoyed by an epidemic which had continued since 998, the previous year, changed the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Gengo.html">gengo</a> (an era name) into "Choho" on January 17. But the epidemic was not subdued, and there was a fire in the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Dairi (the Imperial palace).html">dairi</a> (Imperial Palace) on June 14. </p>
<p><a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/The Imperial Court.html">The Imperial Court</a>, including <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Ichijo.html">Emperor Ichijo</a> and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Nairan.html">nairan</a> <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Sadaijin (Minister of the Left).html">sadaijin</a> (minister of the left who has a right to read and deal with documents before reporting to the Emperor from Daijokan, the Great Council of State) <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/FUJIWARA no Michinaga.html">FUJIWARA no Michinaga</a>, was so concerned about growing social unrest and a series of disasters that it decided to rebuild the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Dairi (the Imperial palace).html">dairi</a> on July 11 and discussed unconventionality in the Buddhist and the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> rituals as well as a ban on luxurious dressing, in order to subdue social unrest through a belief in God and to restore order by reinforcing control. ("Shoyuki" (the diary of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/FUJIWARA no Sanesuke.html">FUJIWARA no Sanesuke</a>), "<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Gonki.html">Gonki</a>" (<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/FUJIWARA no Yukinari.html">FUJIWARA no Yukinari</a>'s diary))<br/>
Subsequently the final discussion was held between the Emperor and Michinaga on July 21, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Senji (imperial decree).html">senji</a> (imperial decree) about the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Shinsei (Law reconstitution).html">shinsei</a> was issued on the next day, and the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Daijokanpu.html">Daijokanpu</a> was issued on the basis of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Senji (imperial decree).html">senji</a> as of July 27. <h3>Contents</h3>

</p>
<p>The first six clauses are rules about "(<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a>) shrines and (Buddhist) temples" (relations with religions), the next four clauses are about "kasateishi (prohibition of the luxury beyond one's means or position)" and the last clause is about "strict enforcement of government affairs." It is possible to learn that the procedure for discussion in connection with this <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Shinsei (Law reconstitution).html">shinsei</a> and arrangement of provisions of the law were made a precedent for issuance of the subsequent <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Shinsei (Law reconstitution).html">shinsei</a>, from the description of the procedure in an article dated November 1, 1190 of "<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Gyokuyo.html">Gyokuyo</a>," the diary of FUJIWARA no Kanezane about two hundred years later. <h3>Impact</h3>
</p>
<p>This <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Shinsei (Law reconstitution).html">shinsei</a> served as a law of indefinite duration, unlike a provisional ban on luxury issued at the time of events and rituals. On the other hand, officials in charge of actual enforcement (including <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Kebiishi (police and judicial chief).html">kebiishi</a> (officials with judicial and police powers) and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Danjodai (Board of Censors).html">danjodai</a> (Board of Censors)) were not necessarily familiarized with this <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Shinsei (Law reconstitution).html">shinsei</a>. </p>
<p>According to "<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Gonki.html">Gonki</a>," on May 8, 1000, the day after the issuance of Chohogannenrei, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Kebiishi (police and judicial chief).html">Kebiishi</a> no betto (Superintendent of the Imperial Police) <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/FUJIWARA no Kinto.html">FUJIWARA no Kinto</a> told <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/FUJIWARA no Yukinari.html">FUJIWARA no Yukinari</a> (the author of "<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Gonki.html">Gonki</a>") that on the previous day <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Kinto (tea cloth container).html">Kinto</a> had been reprimanded by Emperor Ichiijo via <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/SUGAWARA no Takasue.html">SUGAWARA no Takasue</a> (<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Kurodo (Chamberlain).html">Kurodo</a> (Chamberlain)) for insufficient enforcement of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Shinsei (Law reconstitution).html">shinsei</a>, which was regarded as negligence of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Kebiishi (police and judicial chief).html">kebiishi</a>. In response to this reprimand, Kebiishicho (Office of Police and Judicial Chief) partially revised clauses 5, 7, and 9, which were the most controversial, and presented the revised <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Shinsei (Law reconstitution).html">shinsei</a> as a new law to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Ichijo.html">Emperor Ichijo</a> via <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Kinto (tea cloth container).html">Kinto</a>, and issued Chohogannenrei again based on this revision (an article dated May 14, 1000 of "<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Gonki.html">Gonki</a>"). Furthermore, after a second fire in the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Dairi (the Imperial palace).html">dairi</a> on November 18, 1001, a <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Shinsei (Law reconstitution).html">shinsei</a> consisting of five clauses was established on November 25, which further reinforced provisions of the former clauses 7 and 9, and was issued on December 8. Furthermore, in connection with clauses 2 and 4, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Daijokanpu.html">Daijokanpu</a> concerning renovation of shrines as well as of provincial monasteries, provincial nunneries and Jogaku-ji temples (temples recognized as equivalent to a government temple) was issued on October 9, 1002. Thus Chohogannenrei remained effective for a long time, after being reinforced and reissued three times in three years from 1000 to 1002, and a ban on luxury which reconfirmed a series of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Shinsei (Law reconstitution).html">shinsei</a> in the Choho era was issued in 1030. </p>
<p>While <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Shinsei (Law reconstitution).html">shinsei</a> before Chohogannenrei were no more than a "new ban" which retained characteristics of the former laws, Chohogannenrei was the first to be established based on the idea of promotion of "virtuous rule" for eradicating disaster and rehabilitating politics, originating from tenjin sokansetsu (one of ancient Chinese views of the world and political thought, the theory that there is close relationship between human action or political affairs, personnel affairs, and natural phenomenon), which was the main motivation for issuing <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Shinsei (Law reconstitution).html">shinsei</a> in the medieval period. <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Kanezane KUJO.html">Kanezane KUJO</a> (the sixth generation descendant of Michinaga), who was involved in the establishment of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Shinsei (Law reconstitution).html">shinsei</a> in Jisho and Kenkyu eras as a minister and Sekkan (regents and advisers), often insisted that it was fundamental for the establishment of seifu (an official code of new laws issued by Daijokan, Great Council of State) or <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Shinsei (Law reconstitution).html">shinsei</a> to "follow the example of Choho" (articles dated April 23 and June 5, 1178 of "<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Gyokuyo.html">Gyokuyo</a>") and it follows that even two hundred years after the Choho era it was widely believed in the court noble society that Chohogannenrei should be a starting <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Point (Sentoki).html">point</a> for <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Shinsei (Law reconstitution).html">shinsei</a> and that kugeho (laws issued by the imperial court) in the medieval period was greatly influenced by such a belief. </p>
