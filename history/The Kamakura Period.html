<p></p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period (1185-1333, called "<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> jidai" in Japanese) describes one distinct period in Japanese history in which the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>) was located in the city of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a>. The <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> joined the Imperial Court and took a central role in a country-wide rule; it took its name from its location, in the city of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> in Sagami Province. </p>
<p>As the warrior class separated from the Emperor and the aristocratic class and became a distinct entity in itself, it created the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> out of its search for a new method of government; this ushered in the age of feudal government in Japan. This feudal style of government was to continue for almost seven hundred years, until the destruction of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Edo bakufu.html">Edo bakufu</a> in 1868. </p>
<p>There are many theories about in what year the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period truly began, of which the 1192 theory, the year <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Yoritomo.html">MINAMOTO no Yoritomo</a> was made <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> (Seii taishogun (literally, "great general who subdues the barbarians")), is the orthodox view, but in addition, theories include: the 1180 theory, focusing on Yoritomo raising his army and leading his <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Gokenin.html">gokenin</a> (lower-ranking warrior vassals) into battle to destroy the Taira clan, and also establishing the Samurai Dokoro (Board of Retainers, which oversaw rewards for service); the 1183 theory, in which the key moment is the official recognition of the shogunate's right to control Eastern Japan (everything along the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/road/Tokaido.html">Tokaido</a> and Tosando highways) proclaimed by the imperial court in the tenth month; the 1185 theory, which focuses on Yoritomo's use of his struggle to destroy his younger brother <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Yoshitsune.html">MINAMOTO no Yoshitsune</a> as a pretext to usurp the right to appoint and control the offices of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a> (provincial governor) and jito (estate steward); the 1190 theory, in which it was Yoritomo's visit to the capital and subsequent court appointments to Gon <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Dainagon (chief councilor of state).html">Dainagon</a> (Deputy Major Counselor) and Ukone Taisho (Commander of the Guardsmen of the Right) that is considered the decisive moment; and a handful even believe it wasn't until 1196 that the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period truly began. </p>
<p>Among these views, in recent years it is the theory that 1185 was the critical year, citing as evidence the Minamoto's annihilation of the Taira clan at Dannoura coupled with Yoritomo's usurpation of the right to appoint <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a> and jito--who were the true power base critical to ruling throughout the country--that carries the most relative weight. </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>Towards the end of the twelfth century, MINAMOTO no Yoritomo--often called 'Lord <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a>'--having reached the pinnacle of the warrior's world, began to select and send out the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a> (governors) to all the provinces and created the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>. The <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> didn't interfere with the Imperial Court in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> or with the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> and public territories in rural areas, instead creating a dual system of government (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> and Court) under which it had the power to appoint warriors (as opposed to Court noblemen) to the key positions, including the jito, that controlled the countryside. </p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> was established as an extension of the private household administration of Yoritomo (Lord <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a>) and as such, did not count as a public institution according to the standards of the day. Consequently, those sent out by the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> into the provinces as governors and so forth were warriors from one of the Minamoto clan's home provinces or otherwise engaged in a master-servant relationship with Yoritomo (as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Gokenin.html">gokenin</a>, his vassals); the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> never achieved control over all the country's warriors, ruling instead through its close allies and retainers. By contrast, the Taira clan had invested much of its political power in the Imperial Court, and had sought to rule through the court. But after the Mongol invasions, the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> assumed the right to mobilize all the warriors in the country, and with this achieved de facto control over the entire country. </p>
<p>The most striking difference between the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> and the prior warrior government run by the Taira clan was the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>'s creation of what was called the Monjusho (hereafter referred to as the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Hyojosho (conference chamber).html">Hyojosho</a> or "Office of Arbitration"), an organization devoted to hearing and ruling on legal disputes over land ownership; until this office was founded, final authority to own land rested with the side whose military might was greatest and disputes were resolved in a simple way--through force--but the new office substantially reduced such bloody conflicts. Questions over land ownership contributed to virtually all fighting and conflict among warriors--and thus, almost all disturbances throughout the country--and Yoritomo's new theory of governance (as expressed by the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Hyojosho (conference chamber).html">Hyojosho</a>) was to serve as the foundation of the bakufu-dominal system for many years thereafter. </p>
<p>After <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Yoritomo.html">MINAMOTO no Yoritomo</a> died, an administrative system was created by the Hojo clan to fill the role of Shogunal advisor to the Imperial Court; they also arranged the system so that even if Yoritomo's bloodline died out, the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> system could continue, and to serve as the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>'s legal basis created the Goseibei <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shikimoku.html">Shikimoku</a> (Formulary of Adjudications), the first set of laws governing the warrior class, which was to became the legal foundation of medieval society in Japan. </p>
<p>The end result of the Jokyu Rebellion, in which Retired Emperor Gotoba and others tried to overthrow the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>, was the triumph of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> over the court--this rebellion ushered in a new era, one of the political ascendancy of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> over the court. Many <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Gokenin.html">gokenin</a> were awarded land in western Japan for their service putting down the rebellion, and thereby the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> extended their control beyond the eastern provinces, where their power had been concentrated, into the western provinces as well. </p>
<p>Economically, the system by which warriors, the de facto landowners in rural areas, could own and control land had now been legally stabilized, sparking a country-wide cultivation of land and leading to a vigorous flourishing of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> culture. Given this societal milieu, a new style arose both culturally and artistically, differing from the cultural output of aristocratic societies heretofore, with a preference for new items in the Buddhist and fine arts that were easier to understand, catering more to warriors and commoners. The political stability brought expanded trade of commodities especially in western Japan, and markets available at regular intervals sprang up all over the country. </p>
<p>In the thirteenth century, the Mongols invaded twice, these invasions being called the Bunei engagement of 1274 and the Koan engagement of 1281, so called from the names of the eras in which they occurred. After fierce fighting, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> forces were able to repel these two Yuan (dynasty) invasions. It was these victories that first gave rise to the belief that 'Japan is a divine country,' a conviction that was to leave a deep, indelible mark on the historical consciousness of later generations. And although the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> managed to fend off the Mongol invasions, these two battles were unlike any previous conflicts in that the enemy was from a genuinely foreign country, meaning that no land to speak of had been confiscated and thus that there was very little with which to reward the warriors (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Gokenin.html">gokenin</a>) who had fought to repulse the invaders, which led to a souring of the relationship between the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> and its <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Gokenin.html">gokenin</a>, who had faithfully responded to the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>'s emergency summons. </p>
<p>Using the Mongol invasions as an opportunity, the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> seized the authority to issue military mobilizations of all warriors throughout the country, including non-gokenin, and also worked to solidify its control over western Japan by creating offices such as Chinzei <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Tandai.html">tandai</a> (military commissioner of Kyushu) and Nagato <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Tandai.html">tandai</a> (military commissioner of western Honshu). But the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/family/Tokuso.html">Tokuso</a> family--the primary lineage of the Hojo clan--which was bent on extending and strengthening their central authority and rule throughout the country and especially in the west, started to exclude <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Gokenin.html">gokenin</a>, and began trying to promote only <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Miuchibito (Private Vassals of the Tokuso Family).html">miuchibito</a> (private family retainers) who were <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Hikan (low ranking clerks).html">Hikan</a> (vassals working for the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Rokuhara Tandai (an administrative and judicial agency in Rokuhara, Kyoto).html">Rokuhara Tandai</a>). Consequently, the hearts of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Gokenin.html">gokenin</a> gradually began to drift further and further away from the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>; these actions by the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/family/Tokuso.html">Tokuso</a> provoked a smoldering dissatisfaction among the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Gokenin.html">gokenin</a> and among all warriors. It is cited as one of the causes of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>'s later collapse. </p>
<p>Also fall of the Imperial Court after the Jokyu Rebellion resulted in losing its ability to solve the imperial succession crisis and consequently it entangled the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> without any choice. The <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>, as concerning the system of the alternate enthronement of the two rival imperial lines, adopted a policy of making recommendations concerning the imperial succession and mediating between the daikakuji and jimyoin lineages without being drawn in too deeply to successional disputes, but in the end, after a long period of confusion over the succession, the imperial court made a new request for the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> to intervene, while the faction on the losing end of this dispute, nursing newfound dissatisfaction against the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> because of the results of this intervention, ended up making a request of their own, leading to a vicious circle that conflicted ever deeper with the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>'s hands-off policy. As a result, when the policy eventually reached the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Point (Sentoki).html">point</a> of refusing to consider descendants of Emperor Godaigo, himself a scion of the Daikakuji lineage, as candidates for the throne, Emperor Godaigo was able to harness the long-festering resentment among warriors towards those who supported this policy--the nobility and the bakufu--and cooperate with them to launch a coup d'etat, which then developed into a full-scale rebellion against the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>. <h3>Chronology</h3>

</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period is generally recognized as the period in which warriors managed to seize political power. Yet throughout the period <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> remained ahead of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> as the dominant metropolis economically, and the court, the nobility, and the religious establishments retained considerable power. The warrior class, the nobility, and the religious orders ruled jointly, each both complementing and competing with the others in different ways. So although at first the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> ruled in partnership with the court, it is fitting to consider the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period the transition during which, as a result of the Jokyu War, the warrior class--and the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> in particular--gradually superceded the court in power. </p>
<p>Initially, what lay at the heart of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> was the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> (or in actuality, 'the Lord of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a>.'<br/>
The position of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> (Seii taishogun) was not strictly necessary). But the primary bloodline of the Minamoto clan (specifically, the lineage of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Yoritomo.html">MINAMOTO no Yoritomo</a> of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kawachi-Genji.html">Kawachi-Genji</a>) died out after supplying the first three Shoguns, and the position of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> became a mere puppet filled first by court nobles ("Sekke Shoguns" of the Fujiwara line of regents and advisors) and later by imperial princes ("Miya Shoguns"), while true power shifted over to the Council of Thirteen. And with the Heizenmon Rebellion and the battles of Wada and Hoji, the Hoji clan was able to purge the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> of all the non-Hojo warrior clans, stepping up their efforts to concentrate all power in their own hands. Yoritomo's wife <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Masako HOJO.html">Masako HOJO</a>, to whom passed the reins of the government, saw to it that the Hojo clan, who held the position of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Regent.html">regent</a> to the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a>, would retain true power. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Tokiyori HOJO.html">Tokiyori HOJO</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Regent.html">regent</a> to the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a>, continued to manage the affairs of state even after retiring as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Regent.html">regent</a>, further shifting the concentration of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> power and authority from the position of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Regent.html">regent</a> to the main branch (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Honke.html">Honke</a>) of the Hojo clan, of whom <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yasutoki HOJO.html">Yasutoki HOJO</a> was the progenitor, by which change it could no longer be said with confidence that the most powerful person in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> was necessarily the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Regent.html">regent</a> to the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a>. With the Palace and February Disturbances, the Nagoshi branch of the Hojo clan and other factions who opposed the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/family/Tokuso.html">Tokuso</a> branch (the main lineage) were driven from the government. Among the Hojo clan's most notable achievements was the enactment of the Goseibai <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shikimoku.html">shikimoku</a> (Formulary of Adjudications). These regulations legally differentiated the warrior class from the aristocracy, heretofore (legally) indistinguishable, and demonstrated that the nobility and the warriors had parted ways. But in addition to purging from true power all other warrior clans, the Hojo also saw to it that the majority of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a> (governor) positions in the various provinces were held by Hojo clan members, and moreover, that their private vassals the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Miuchibito (Private Vassals of the Tokuso Family).html">Miuchibito</a> were treated very well, which invited malcontent among the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Gokenin.html">gokenin</a> and provincial warriors. </p>
<p>During the time of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Regent.html">regent</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Tokimune HOJO.html">Tokimune HOJO</a>, Japan was twice invaded by the Mongols, and although the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> managed to repel both invasions, it was an international conflict and thus there was no enemy land to confiscate and award to their soldiers, leaving them unable to provide suitable rewards, something that only strengthened malcontent among the warrior class. Moreover, a money-based economy had begun to proliferate, which led to the financial ruin of many <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Gokenin.html">gokenin</a> as they fell deeply into debt with members of the merchant class, looked down upon as Bonge ("commoners"). The <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> did try to save such financially ruined <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Gokenin.html">gokenin</a> by ordering two rounds of debt forgiveness, the 1284 Koan Tokusei ("benevolent rule," a euphemism for the mass forgiving of debts) and then the 1297 Einin Tokusei, but as they could not provide sufficient rewards and yet were reluctant to allow merchants to loan money to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Gokenin.html">gokenin</a>, the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>'s efforts only ended up exacerbating disgruntlement among the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Gokenin.html">gokenin</a>, inviting further chaos and disorder. This situation allowed Emperor Godaigo, making full use of discontent among the warriors, to successfully overthrow the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>. <h3>The system of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a> and Jito</h3>
</p>
<p>In 1185, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Yoritomo.html">MINAMOTO no Yoritomo</a>, in response to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/OE no Hiromoto.html">OE no Hiromoto</a>'s suggestion, instituted a countrywide system of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a> (governors) and jito (estate stewards) with the goal of hunting down his younger brother, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Yoshitsune.html">MINAMOTO no Yoshitsune</a>. A single <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a> was sent to each province and given responsibility for the Three Duties concerning arch-criminals, which included killing traitors and rebels, and put in charge of leading all the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Gokenin.html">gokenin</a> in the province. Jito were placed at both <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> (private estates) and koryo (public territories), and were responsible for both levying the annual tax and managing and otherwise overseeing the land. With the backing and authority of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>, jito could (and many did) treat <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> very harshly; given their total contractual power over <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> to collect the predetermined amount for the annual tax regardless of whether it had been a good or a poor harvest, and their power forcibly to divide the land in a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> into the jito's private section and the (absentee) owner's section, many jito were oppressive and little more than tyrants, in a sense. <h3>Commercial and industrial features of the period</h3>

<p><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Myoden.html">Myoden</a> (an administrative division of land)<br/>
Rice and then barley (in the Kinai (the central provinces) and in western Japan) were grown as the two crops for Nimosaku (fields that produced two different crop harvests in a year). Selective breeding was performed to create and improve early-, mid-, and late-ripening strains of rice. Karashiki (mountain cuttings), vegetal ash, and nightsoil were used as field fertilizers. Oxen and horses were used to plow fields. Water wheels were used to pump water into the fields. 
<br/>Principal agricultural products: kaji (paper mulberry), egoma, Chinese indigo, mulberry, and (green) tea<br/>

<h3><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period culture</h3>
</p>
<p>One of the most striking features of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period culture is the rise of a new warrior and commoner culture in opposition to the existing aristocratic culture; the period saw the emergence of dual cultures. </p>
<p>The new culture's creative style is generally described as simple, plain, and realistic. The influence of Zen culture imported from (both Song- and Yuan-period) China was very pronounced. <h3>Literature</h3>

The Hyakurensho (One Hundred Selected Refinements, a historical record of the Kamakura Period)<br/>
<h3>Efforts to reform Buddhism</h3>
</p>
<p>Events that led to the reforming of the Buddhist faith--which up through the Heian period had remained very abstruse, comprehensible only to a select few, and for which any proselytizing activities towards the masses were prohibited--included the rise to prominence of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> sect of Buddhism as well as new progress in efforts to reform Nara (i.e., old-guard) Buddhism. One major characteristic of such reforms was the shift away from the mission to protect the state spiritually, which was Buddhism's main goal up through the Heian period, and towards the salvation of the general public, and the Buddhist clergy began taking the first steps towards a burgeoning independence from the state. </p>
<p>And as the Hogen Rebellion led to the Heiji War, which blossomed in turn into the Genpei War (the war between the Minamoto (Gen) and Taira (Hei) clans, known as Jisho-Juei no ran in Japanese for the two eras in which it occurred), this age of wars and rebellions only reinforced a pessimistic view of the world (based on the idea of Mappo, the final and worst age in Buddhist theology), and led to many seeking salvation for their souls. Furthermore, great headway was made in simplifying Buddhism for the general public. </p>
<p>And while on the one hand <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Enryaku-ji Temple.html">Enryaku-ji Temple</a> (the main temple of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Mt. Hiei.html">Mt. Hiei</a>, also called "<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Sanmon (large triple gate to temple).html">Sanmon</a>"), which had shouldered the burden of spiritually protecting the state throughout the Heian period, zealously poured considerable effort into teaching its doctrine and promoting systematic study of its precepts, it also acquired political might through its prayers and incantations coupled with the military strength of its <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Sohei.html">sohei</a> (warrior monks). Moreover, spiritual tenets shifted away from the Nenbutsu Zanmai (deep prayer to Amida Buddha) passed down to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Mt. Hiei.html">Mt. Hiei</a> by the monk <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Ennin.html">Ennin</a> and towards the monk <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Genshin (Monk).html">Genshin</a>'s Tendai and Jodo (Pure Land) teachings as well as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Ryonin.html">Ryonin</a>'s Yuzu Nenbutsu (Adaptable Prayer to Amida) sect, leading to the ascendancy of Pure Land teachings. And the Tendai sect held the position of Hokke Ichijo, the belief that through recitation of the Lotus sutra, each and every person could attain enlightenment and enter Nirvana. All the founders of new Buddhist sects during the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period (except <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Ippen.html">Ippen</a>) were trained at <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Mt. Hiei.html">Mt. Hiei</a>; indeed, with their belief that all living creatures could be saved, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Mt. Hiei.html">Mt. Hiei</a> was the fertile ground that cultivated new offshoots of the Buddhist faith during the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period. </p>

In their struggle to oppose the rise of these new sects, the old guard of Buddhism criticized the nenbutsu (prayer to Amida Buddha) and honored the traditional precepts, making progress in revitalizing the decaying edifice of old Buddhism from within. Moreover, they strengthened their will to work for the salvation of all living creatures, giving aid to those afflicted with leprosy and to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Hinin.html">hinin</a> (literally "non-humans," members of the outcastes) and other bridge-building efforts, and thus increasing their zeal for social and humanitarian work. </p>

<p>The <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html&quot;>Kamakura</a> period (1185-1333, called &quot;<a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html&quot;>Kamakura</a> jidai&quot; in Japanese) describes one distinct period in Japanese history in which the <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html&quot;>bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html&quot;>shogun</a>) was located in the city of <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html&quot;>Kamakura</a>. The <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html&quot;>Kamakura</a> <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html&quot;>bakufu</a> joined the Imperial Court and took a central role in a country-wide rule; it took its name from its location, in the city of <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html&quot;>Kamakura</a> in Sagami Province. </p>
<p>As the warrior class separated from the Emperor and the aristocratic class and became a distinct entity in itself, it created the <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html&quot;>bakufu</a> out of its search for a new method of government; this ushered in the age of feudal government in Japan. This feudal style of government was to continue for almost seven hundred years, until the destruction of the <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Edo bakufu.html&quot;>Edo bakufu</a> in 1868. </p>
<p>There are many theories about in what year the <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html&quot;>Kamakura</a> period truly began, of which the 1192 theory, the year <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Yoritomo.html&quot;>MINAMOTO no Yoritomo</a> was made <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html&quot;>Shogun</a> (Seii taishogun (literally, &quot;great general who subdues the barbarians&quot;)), is the orthodox view, but in addition, theories include: the 1180 theory, focusing on Yoritomo raising his army and leading his <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Gokenin.html&quot;>gokenin</a> (lower-ranking warrior vassals) into battle to destroy the Taira clan, and also establishing the Samurai Dokoro (Board of Retainers, which oversaw rewards for service); the 1183 theory, in which the key moment is the official recognition of the shogunate's right to control Eastern Japan (everything along the <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/road/Tokaido.html&quot;>Tokaido</a> and Tosando highways) proclaimed by the imperial court in the tenth month; the 1185 theory, which focuses on Yoritomo's use of his struggle to destroy his younger brother <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Yoshitsune.html&quot;>MINAMOTO no Yoshitsune</a> as a pretext to usurp the right to appoint and control the offices of <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html&quot;>shugo</a> (provincial governor) and jito (estate steward); the 1190 theory, in which it was Yoritomo's visit to the capital and subsequent court appointments to Gon <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Dainagon (chief councilor of state).html&quot;>Dainagon</a> (Deputy Major Counselor) and Ukone Taisho (Commander of the Guardsmen of the Right) that is considered the decisive moment; and a handful even believe it wasn't until 1196 that the <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html&quot;>Kamakura</a> period truly began. </p>
<p>Among these views, in recent years it is the theory that 1185 was the critical year, citing as evidence the Minamoto's annihilation of the Taira clan at Dannoura coupled with Yoritomo's usurpation of the right to appoint <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html&quot;>shugo</a> and jito--who were the true power base critical to ruling throughout the country--that carries the most relative weight. </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>Towards the end of the twelfth century, MINAMOTO no Yoritomo--often called 'Lord <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html&quot;>Kamakura</a>'--having reached the pinnacle of the warrior's world, began to select and send out the <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html&quot;>shugo</a> (governors) to all the provinces and created the <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html&quot;>Kamakura</a> <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html&quot;>bakufu</a>. The <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html&quot;>bakufu</a> didn't interfere with the Imperial Court in <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html&quot;>Kyoto</a> or with the <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shoen.html&quot;>shoen</a> and public territories in rural areas, instead creating a dual system of government (<a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html&quot;>bakufu</a> and Court) under which it had the power to appoint warriors (as opposed to Court noblemen) to the key positions, including the jito, that controlled the countryside. </p>
<p>The <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html&quot;>bakufu</a> was established as an extension of the private household administration of Yoritomo (Lord <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html&quot;>Kamakura</a>) and as such, did not count as a public institution according to the standards of the day. Consequently, those sent out by the <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html&quot;>bakufu</a> into the provinces as governors and so forth were warriors from one of the Minamoto clan's home provinces or otherwise engaged in a master-servant relationship with Yoritomo (as <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Gokenin.html&quot;>gokenin</a>, his vassals); the <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html&quot;>bakufu</a> never achieved control over all the country's warriors, ruling instead through its close allies and retainers. By contrast, the Taira clan had invested much of its political power in the Imperial Court, and had sought to rule through the court. But after the Mongol invasions, the <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html&quot;>bakufu</a> assumed the right to mobilize all the warriors in the country, and with this achieved de facto control over the entire country. </p>
<p>The most striking difference between the <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html&quot;>Kamakura</a> <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html&quot;>bakufu</a> and the prior warrior government run by the Taira clan was the <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html&quot;>bakufu</a>'s creation of what was called the Monjusho (hereafter referred to as the <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Hyojosho (conference chamber).html&quot;>Hyojosho</a> or &quot;Office of Arbitration&quot;), an organization devoted to hearing and ruling on legal disputes over land ownership; until this office was founded, final authority to own land rested with the side whose military might was greatest and disputes were resolved in a simple way--through force--but the new office substantially reduced such bloody conflicts. Questions over land ownership contributed to virtually all fighting and conflict among warriors--and thus, almost all disturbances throughout the country--and Yoritomo's new theory of governance (as expressed by the <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Hyojosho (conference chamber).html&quot;>Hyojosho</a>) was to serve as the foundation of the bakufu-dominal system for many years thereafter. </p>
<p>After <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Yoritomo.html&quot;>MINAMOTO no Yoritomo</a> died, an administrative system was created by the Hojo clan to fill the role of Shogunal advisor to the Imperial Court; they also arranged the system so that even if Yoritomo's bloodline died out, the <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html&quot;>Kamakura</a> <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html&quot;>bakufu</a> system could continue, and to serve as the <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html&quot;>bakufu</a>'s legal basis created the Goseibei <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shikimoku.html&quot;>Shikimoku</a> (Formulary of Adjudications), the first set of laws governing the warrior class, which was to became the legal foundation of medieval society in Japan. </p>
<p>The end result of the Jokyu Rebellion, in which Retired Emperor Gotoba and others tried to overthrow the <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html&quot;>bakufu</a>, was the triumph of the <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html&quot;>bakufu</a> over the court--this rebellion ushered in a new era, one of the political ascendancy of the <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html&quot;>bakufu</a> over the court. Many <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Gokenin.html&quot;>gokenin</a> were awarded land in western Japan for their service putting down the rebellion, and thereby the <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html&quot;>bakufu</a> extended their control beyond the eastern provinces, where their power had been concentrated, into the western provinces as well. </p>
<p>Economically, the system by which warriors, the de facto landowners in rural areas, could own and control land had now been legally stabilized, sparking a country-wide cultivation of land and leading to a vigorous flourishing of <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html&quot;>Kamakura</a> culture. Given this societal milieu, a new style arose both culturally and artistically, differing from the cultural output of aristocratic societies heretofore, with a preference for new items in the Buddhist and fine arts that were easier to understand, catering more to warriors and commoners. The political stability brought expanded trade of commodities especially in western Japan, and markets available at regular intervals sprang up all over the country. </p>
<p>In the thirteenth century, the Mongols invaded twice, these invasions being called the Bunei engagement of 1274 and the Koan engagement of 1281, so called from the names of the eras in which they occurred. After fierce fighting, <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html&quot;>bakufu</a> forces were able to repel these two Yuan (dynasty) invasions. It was these victories that first gave rise to the belief that 'Japan is a divine country,' a conviction that was to leave a deep, indelible mark on the historical consciousness of later generations. And although the <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html&quot;>bakufu</a> managed to fend off the Mongol invasions, these two battles were unlike any previous conflicts in that the enemy was from a genuinely foreign country, meaning that no land to speak of had been confiscated and thus that there was very little with which to reward the warriors (<a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Gokenin.html&quot;>gokenin</a>) who had fought to repulse the invaders, which led to a souring of the relationship between the <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html&quot;>bakufu</a> and its <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Gokenin.html&quot;>gokenin</a>, who had faithfully responded to the <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html&quot;>bakufu</a>'s emergency summons. </p>
<p>Using the Mongol invasions as an opportunity, the <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html&quot;>bakufu</a> seized the authority to issue military mobilizations of all warriors throughout the country, including non-gokenin, and also worked to solidify its control over western Japan by creating offices such as Chinzei <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Tandai.html&quot;>tandai</a> (military commissioner of Kyushu) and Nagato <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Tandai.html&quot;>tandai</a> (military commissioner of western Honshu). But the <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/family/Tokuso.html&quot;>Tokuso</a> family--the primary lineage of the Hojo clan--which was bent on extending and strengthening their central authority and rule throughout the country and especially in the west, started to exclude <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Gokenin.html&quot;>gokenin</a>, and began trying to promote only <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Miuchibito (Private Vassals of the Tokuso Family).html&quot;>miuchibito</a> (private family retainers) who were <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Hikan (low ranking clerks).html&quot;>Hikan</a> (vassals working for the <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Rokuhara Tandai (an administrative and judicial agency in Rokuhara, Kyoto).html&quot;>Rokuhara Tandai</a>). Consequently, the hearts of the <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Gokenin.html&quot;>gokenin</a> gradually began to drift further and further away from the <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html&quot;>bakufu</a>; these actions by the <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/family/Tokuso.html&quot;>Tokuso</a> provoked a smoldering dissatisfaction among the <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Gokenin.html&quot;>gokenin</a> and among all warriors. It is cited as one of the causes of the <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html&quot;>bakufu</a>'s later collapse. </p>
<p>Also fall of the Imperial Court after the Jokyu Rebellion resulted in losing its ability to solve the imperial succession crisis and consequently it entangled the <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html&quot;>bakufu</a> without any choice. The <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html&quot;>bakufu</a>, as concerning the system of the alternate enthronement of the two rival imperial lines, adopted a policy of making recommendations concerning the imperial succession and mediating between the daikakuji and jimyoin lineages without being drawn in too deeply to successional disputes, but in the end, after a long period of confusion over the succession, the imperial court made a new request for the <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html&quot;>bakufu</a> to intervene, while the faction on the losing end of this dispute, nursing newfound dissatisfaction against the <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html&quot;>bakufu</a> because of the results of this intervention, ended up making a request of their own, leading to a vicious circle that conflicted ever deeper with the <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html&quot;>bakufu</a>'s hands-off policy. As a result, when the policy eventually reached the <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Point (Sentoki).html&quot;>point</a> of refusing to consider descendants of Emperor Godaigo, himself a scion of the Daikakuji lineage, as candidates for the throne, Emperor Godaigo was able to harness the long-festering resentment among warriors towards those who supported this policy--the nobility and the bakufu--and cooperate with them to launch a coup d'etat, which then developed into a full-scale rebellion against the <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html&quot;>bakufu</a>. <h3>Chronology</h3>

</p>
<p>The <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html&quot;>Kamakura</a> period is generally recognized as the period in which warriors managed to seize political power. Yet throughout the period <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html&quot;>Kyoto</a> remained ahead of <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html&quot;>Kamakura</a> as the dominant metropolis economically, and the court, the nobility, and the religious establishments retained considerable power. The warrior class, the nobility, and the religious orders ruled jointly, each both complementing and competing with the others in different ways. So although at first the <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html&quot;>bakufu</a> ruled in partnership with the court, it is fitting to consider the <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html&quot;>Kamakura</a> period the transition during which, as a result of the Jokyu War, the warrior class--and the <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html&quot;>bakufu</a> in particular--gradually superceded the court in power. </p>
<p>Initially, what lay at the heart of the <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html&quot;>Kamakura</a> <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html&quot;>bakufu</a> was the <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html&quot;>Shogun</a> (or in actuality, 'the Lord of <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html&quot;>Kamakura</a>.'<br/>
The position of <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html&quot;>Shogun</a> (Seii taishogun) was not strictly necessary). But the primary bloodline of the Minamoto clan (specifically, the lineage of <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Yoritomo.html&quot;>MINAMOTO no Yoritomo</a> of the <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kawachi-Genji.html&quot;>Kawachi-Genji</a>) died out after supplying the first three Shoguns, and the position of <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html&quot;>Shogun</a> became a mere puppet filled first by court nobles (&quot;Sekke Shoguns&quot; of the Fujiwara line of regents and advisors) and later by imperial princes (&quot;Miya Shoguns&quot;), while true power shifted over to the Council of Thirteen. And with the Heizenmon Rebellion and the battles of Wada and Hoji, the Hoji clan was able to purge the <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html&quot;>bakufu</a> of all the non-Hojo warrior clans, stepping up their efforts to concentrate all power in their own hands. Yoritomo's wife <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Masako HOJO.html&quot;>Masako HOJO</a>, to whom passed the reins of the government, saw to it that the Hojo clan, who held the position of <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Regent.html&quot;>regent</a> to the <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html&quot;>Shogun</a>, would retain true power. <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Tokiyori HOJO.html&quot;>Tokiyori HOJO</a>, <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Regent.html&quot;>regent</a> to the <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html&quot;>Shogun</a>, continued to manage the affairs of state even after retiring as <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Regent.html&quot;>regent</a>, further shifting the concentration of <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html&quot;>bakufu</a> power and authority from the position of <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Regent.html&quot;>regent</a> to the main branch (<a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Honke.html&quot;>Honke</a>) of the Hojo clan, of whom <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yasutoki HOJO.html&quot;>Yasutoki HOJO</a> was the progenitor, by which change it could no longer be said with confidence that the most powerful person in the <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html&quot;>bakufu</a> was necessarily the <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Regent.html&quot;>regent</a> to the <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html&quot;>Shogun</a>. With the Palace and February Disturbances, the Nagoshi branch of the Hojo clan and other factions who opposed the <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/family/Tokuso.html&quot;>Tokuso</a> branch (the main lineage) were driven from the government. Among the Hojo clan's most notable achievements was the enactment of the Goseibai <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shikimoku.html&quot;>shikimoku</a> (Formulary of Adjudications). These regulations legally differentiated the warrior class from the aristocracy, heretofore (legally) indistinguishable, and demonstrated that the nobility and the warriors had parted ways. But in addition to purging from true power all other warrior clans, the Hojo also saw to it that the majority of <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html&quot;>shugo</a> (governor) positions in the various provinces were held by Hojo clan members, and moreover, that their private vassals the <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Miuchibito (Private Vassals of the Tokuso Family).html&quot;>Miuchibito</a> were treated very well, which invited malcontent among the <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Gokenin.html&quot;>gokenin</a> and provincial warriors. </p>
<p>During the time of the <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Regent.html&quot;>regent</a> <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Tokimune HOJO.html&quot;>Tokimune HOJO</a>, Japan was twice invaded by the Mongols, and although the <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html&quot;>Kamakura</a> <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html&quot;>bakufu</a> managed to repel both invasions, it was an international conflict and thus there was no enemy land to confiscate and award to their soldiers, leaving them unable to provide suitable rewards, something that only strengthened malcontent among the warrior class. Moreover, a money-based economy had begun to proliferate, which led to the financial ruin of many <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Gokenin.html&quot;>gokenin</a> as they fell deeply into debt with members of the merchant class, looked down upon as Bonge (&quot;commoners&quot;). The <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html&quot;>bakufu</a> did try to save such financially ruined <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Gokenin.html&quot;>gokenin</a> by ordering two rounds of debt forgiveness, the 1284 Koan Tokusei (&quot;benevolent rule,&quot; a euphemism for the mass forgiving of debts) and then the 1297 Einin Tokusei, but as they could not provide sufficient rewards and yet were reluctant to allow merchants to loan money to <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Gokenin.html&quot;>gokenin</a>, the <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html&quot;>bakufu</a>'s efforts only ended up exacerbating disgruntlement among the <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Gokenin.html&quot;>gokenin</a>, inviting further chaos and disorder. This situation allowed Emperor Godaigo, making full use of discontent among the warriors, to successfully overthrow the <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html&quot;>bakufu</a>. <h3>The system of <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html&quot;>Shugo</a> and Jito</h3>
</p>
<p>In 1185, <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Yoritomo.html&quot;>MINAMOTO no Yoritomo</a>, in response to <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/OE no Hiromoto.html&quot;>OE no Hiromoto</a>'s suggestion, instituted a countrywide system of <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html&quot;>shugo</a> (governors) and jito (estate stewards) with the goal of hunting down his younger brother, <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Yoshitsune.html&quot;>MINAMOTO no Yoshitsune</a>. A single <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html&quot;>shugo</a> was sent to each province and given responsibility for the Three Duties concerning arch-criminals, which included killing traitors and rebels, and put in charge of leading all the <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Gokenin.html&quot;>gokenin</a> in the province. Jito were placed at both <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shoen.html&quot;>shoen</a> (private estates) and koryo (public territories), and were responsible for both levying the annual tax and managing and otherwise overseeing the land. With the backing and authority of the <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html&quot;>Kamakura</a> <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html&quot;>bakufu</a>, jito could (and many did) treat <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shoen.html&quot;>shoen</a> very harshly; given their total contractual power over <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shoen.html&quot;>shoen</a> to collect the predetermined amount for the annual tax regardless of whether it had been a good or a poor harvest, and their power forcibly to divide the land in a <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shoen.html&quot;>shoen</a> into the jito's private section and the (absentee) owner's section, many jito were oppressive and little more than tyrants, in a sense. <h3>Commercial and industrial features of the period</h3>

</p>
<p><a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Myoden.html&quot;>Myoden</a> (an administrative division of land)<br/>
Rice and then barley (in the Kinai (the central provinces) and in western Japan) were grown as the two crops for Nimosaku (fields that produced two different crop harvests in a year). Selective breeding was performed to create and improve early-, mid-, and late-ripening strains of rice. Karashiki (mountain cuttings), vegetal ash, and nightsoil were used as field fertilizers. Oxen and horses were used to plow fields. Water wheels were used to pump water into the fields. 
<br/>Principal agricultural products: kaji (paper mulberry), egoma, Chinese indigo, mulberry, and (green) tea<br/>
<h3>Principal means of trade and communication</h3>
</p>
<p>The <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/road/Tokaido.html&quot;>Tokaido</a> highway (between <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html&quot;>Kyoto</a> and <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html&quot;>Kamakura</a>), which was maintained<br/>

<h3><a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html&quot;>Kamakura</a> period culture</h3>
</p>
<p>One of the most striking features of <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html&quot;>Kamakura</a> period culture is the rise of a new warrior and commoner culture in opposition to the existing aristocratic culture; the period saw the emergence of dual cultures. </p>
<p>The new culture's creative style is generally described as simple, plain, and realistic. The influence of Zen culture imported from (both Song- and Yuan-period) China was very pronounced. <h3>Literature</h3>

The Hyakurensho (One Hundred Selected Refinements, a historical record of the Kamakura Period)<br/>
<h3>Efforts to reform Buddhism</h3>
</p>
<p>Events that led to the reforming of the Buddhist faith--which up through the Heian period had remained very abstruse, comprehensible only to a select few, and for which any proselytizing activities towards the masses were prohibited--included the rise to prominence of the <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html&quot;>Kamakura</a> sect of Buddhism as well as new progress in efforts to reform Nara (i.e., old-guard) Buddhism. One major characteristic of such reforms was the shift away from the mission to protect the state spiritually, which was Buddhism's main goal up through the Heian period, and towards the salvation of the general public, and the Buddhist clergy began taking the first steps towards a burgeoning independence from the state. </p>
<p>And as the Hogen Rebellion led to the Heiji War, which blossomed in turn into the Genpei War (the war between the Minamoto (Gen) and Taira (Hei) clans, known as Jisho-Juei no ran in Japanese for the two eras in which it occurred), this age of wars and rebellions only reinforced a pessimistic view of the world (based on the idea of Mappo, the final and worst age in Buddhist theology), and led to many seeking salvation for their souls. Furthermore, great headway was made in simplifying Buddhism for the general public. </p>
<p>And while on the one hand <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Enryaku-ji Temple.html&quot;>Enryaku-ji Temple</a> (the main temple of <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Mt. Hiei.html&quot;>Mt. Hiei</a>, also called &quot;<a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Sanmon (large triple gate to temple).html&quot;>Sanmon</a>&quot;), which had shouldered the burden of spiritually protecting the state throughout the Heian period, zealously poured considerable effort into teaching its doctrine and promoting systematic study of its precepts, it also acquired political might through its prayers and incantations coupled with the military strength of its <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Sohei.html&quot;>sohei</a> (warrior monks). Moreover, spiritual tenets shifted away from the Nenbutsu Zanmai (deep prayer to Amida Buddha) passed down to <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Mt. Hiei.html&quot;>Mt. Hiei</a> by the monk <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Ennin.html&quot;>Ennin</a> and towards the monk <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Genshin (Monk).html&quot;>Genshin</a>'s Tendai and Jodo (Pure Land) teachings as well as <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Ryonin.html&quot;>Ryonin</a>'s Yuzu Nenbutsu (Adaptable Prayer to Amida) sect, leading to the ascendancy of Pure Land teachings. And the Tendai sect held the position of Hokke Ichijo, the belief that through recitation of the Lotus sutra, each and every person could attain enlightenment and enter Nirvana. All the founders of new Buddhist sects during the <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html&quot;>Kamakura</a> period (except <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Ippen.html&quot;>Ippen</a>) were trained at <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Mt. Hiei.html&quot;>Mt. Hiei</a>; indeed, with their belief that all living creatures could be saved, <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Mt. Hiei.html&quot;>Mt. Hiei</a> was the fertile ground that cultivated new offshoots of the Buddhist faith during the <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html&quot;>Kamakura</a> period. </p>
<p>New schools of Buddhist thought founded during the <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html&quot;>Kamakura</a> period<br/>

</p>

The Kegon sect (founded by Myoe)<br/>
The Ritsu sect (founded by <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Shunjo.html&quot;>Shunjo</a>, <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Eison.html&quot;>Eison</a>, and <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Ninsho.html&quot;>Ninsho</a>)<br/>
In their struggle to oppose the rise of these new sects, the old guard of Buddhism criticized the nenbutsu (prayer to Amida Buddha) and honored the traditional precepts, making progress in revitalizing the decaying edifice of old Buddhism from within. Moreover, they strengthened their will to work for the salvation of all living creatures, giving aid to those afflicted with leprosy and to <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Hinin.html&quot;>hinin</a> (literally &quot;non-humans,&quot; members of the outcastes) and other bridge-building efforts, and thus increasing their zeal for social and humanitarian work. </p>

After the oppression and eventual collapse of the Southern Song dynasty due to the invasion of the Yuan (Mongol) dynasty to the north, Zen Buddhist intellectuals began to cross over to Japan.
