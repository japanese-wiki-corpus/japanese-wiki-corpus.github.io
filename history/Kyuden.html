In the modern age, rice fields granted to the three top officers in the village such as the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shoya (village headman).html">shoya</a> (village headman) were called Kyuden. </p>

<p><h3>Establishment and development</h3>
</p>
<p>Kyuden (Kyudenpaku) were established from the end of the Heian period to the beginning of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period. This was the time when the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shoen.html">Shoen</a> koryo (public lands) system was developed and the management system for <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kokugaryo.html">kokugaryo</a> (territories governed by provincial government office) was being established. The management of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> and koryo required the existence of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shokan.html">shokan</a>, who did the daily management, couriers such as Kajitori who transported the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Nengu (Land Tax).html">nengu</a> to the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> landholder (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Honjo (proprietor or guarantor of manor).html">Honjo</a>) in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and various craftsmen who made handicrafts to be given to the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Honjo (proprietor or guarantor of manor).html">Honjo</a> and payment for the services of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shokan.html">shokan</a> and craftsmen were Kyuden. </p>
<p>From the late Heian period (eleventh to twelfth century), <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Gunji.html">Gunji</a> (district magistrates), Goji (local government official) and local <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kannin (officials).html">kannin</a> (officers) developed abandoned fields and became development landholders who were recognized as having a certain income by the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kokuga (provincial government office compounds).html">Kokuga</a>. However the income rights of the development landholders (kaihatsu shoryo) were unstable and always in danger of being taken away by the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kokuga (provincial government office compounds).html">Kokuga</a>. Therefore the development landholders donated their kaihatsu shoryo to prominent temples, shrines or aristocrats and the rice fields became part of a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a>. Upon donation, the development landholders were appointed as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shokan.html">shokan</a> by the new landholder and were given kyuden. The development landholder lost the kaihatsu shoryo recognized by the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kokuga (provincial government office compounds).html">kokuga</a>, but it was conventional that they were given equivalent or more rice fields as Kyuden. In addition, land that was directly under the development landholder's control, such as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Tsukuda.html">Tsukuda</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Horinouchi.html">Horinouchi</a> and Monden, was also recognized as Kyuden. </p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shokan.html">shokan</a> was responsible for collecting the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Nengu (Land Tax).html">nengu</a> and kuji (public duties) for the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> landholder, but the kyuden were exempt from all <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Nengu (Land Tax).html">nengu</a> and kuji, and the exempt portion was the income of the kyuden right holder. This was the most different aspect compared to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Menden.html">Menden</a>, which were exempt from only kuji, and Kyumyo exempt from temporary <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Zoyaku.html">zoyaku</a>, and was also called Honkyuden to distinguish it from <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Menden.html">Menden</a> and Kyumyo. </p>
<p>Many Shokunin Kyuden were placed close to the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kokuga (provincial government office compounds).html">Kokuga</a>. Originally,many handicraftsmen were affiliated with the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kokuga (provincial government office compounds).html">Kokuga</a> organization and produced the supplies required for <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kokuga (provincial government office compounds).html">Kokuga</a> management. The payment was paid by the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kokuga (provincial government office compounds).html">Kokuga</a>, but in the late Heian period, the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kokuga (provincial government office compounds).html">Kokuga</a> organization based on the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Ritsuryo.html">Ritsuryo</a> system was dramatically reorganized and Kyuden were given to handicraftsmen as payment instead. As for <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shoen.html">Shoen</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> landholders kept handicraftsmen within their <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> to obtain necessary supplies and gave Kyuden according to their ability. </p>
<p>After the Jyokyu War in the early thirteenth century, the Shinpo rippo (the regulation regarding new Jito appointments) was established to give 1 cho of kyuden per 11 cho of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> koryo to newly appointed jito, but in actuality, there were many cases where two or even three cho of kyuden were given, strongly pushing the invasion of newly appointed jito into <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> koryo. </p>
<p>The management of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> was first done using their own servants and followers, but as the ages went on, leasing out to the village headman and farmers within the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> became the practice. <h3>Types</h3>
</p>
<p>Kyuden in the middle ages were largely classified into <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shokan.html">Shokan</a> kyuden given to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shokan.html">shokan</a>, and shokunin kyuden given to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Nengu (Land Tax).html">nengu</a> couriers and handicraftsmen. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shokan.html">Shokan</a> kyuden were classified into <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Azukaridokoro.html">Azukaridokoro</a> (a deputy of "<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shoen.html">Shoen</a>" manor lord) kyu, Jitokyu, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kumon (official document).html">Kumon</a> (a local <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> official) kyu, Geshi (a local keeper) kyu, Tadokorokyu, Sotsuibushi (government post in charge of police and military roles) kyu, Tonekyu, Bantokyu, Jotsukai (a lower-ranked officer who governs <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shoen.html">Shoen</a> manor) kyu, Anju (officer who recorded and stored documents at Shoens, authorities) kyu, Nanushi (village headman) kyu, Shikiji (a person with an official rank but has no corresponding position) kyu, Sanshikyu, Zushi (temporary officer who made maps of rice fields) kyu, Kunin (low ranking staff who did odd jobs) kyu, etc. </p>
<p>Shokunin kyuden included Kajitori (rower) kyu, Furyokyu, Fune (ship) kyu, Kaji (blacksmith) kyu, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bansho.html">Bansho</a> (builder) kyu, Edokoro (art office) kyu, Himono (craft of bending Hinoki bark) kyu, Dokisaku (pottery) kyu and Dodoukutorei (road building) kyu. <h3>Modern ages</h3>
</p>
<p>Kyuden continued into the late middle ages and were passed on to the modern age with some changes. In the modern ages, kyuden were designated mainly for village officials such as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shoya (village headman).html">Shoya</a>. It was also called Yakukyuden or Shoyakyuden. There were also Kyuden given to handicraftsmen and Kaisengyosha (shipping agents), which were called Shokyu. Kyuden in the modern ages were seen throughout the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Edo Period.html">Edo Period</a>. Kyuden given to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shoya (village headman).html">Shoya</a> from the domain lord were exempt from land tax. In some cases, exemption from tax was taken away because of the financial situation of the domain. <h3>Place names</h3>
</p>
<p>Kyuden place names derived from kyuden in the middle ages and modern ages are found throughout the nation. Main examples are Kyuden, Chonan-cho, Chosei-gun, Chiba Prefecture, Kyuden, Sedagaya Ward, Tokyo, Kyuden, Shimokanuki, Numazu City, Shizuoka Prefecture. </p>
<p>Others: Kumonkyu (Kuga-cho, Iwakuni City, Yamaguchi Prefecture), Jitokyu (Akaiwa City, Okayama Prefecture, Maebaru City, Fukuoka Prefecture), Kajikyu (Nankoku City, Kochi Prefecture, Koga City, Fukuoka Prefecture), Banshokyu (Hofu City, Yamaguchi Prefecture, Totsuka Ward, Yokohama City, Kanagawa Prefecture) and Tobitakyu (Kamigakyu, Chofu City, Tokyo) are examples of place names originating from Kyuden that are still in use today throughout the nation. </p>
