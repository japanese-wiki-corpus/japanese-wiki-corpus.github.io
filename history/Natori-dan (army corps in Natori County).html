<h1>Natori-dan (army corps in Natori County) (名取団)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Natori-dan refers to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Gundan (army corps) (in ancient Japan).html">Gundan</a> (army corps in ancient Japan) deployed in Natori County, Mutsu Province (later Rikuzen Province), Japan from the early 8th century to the 10th century. An accurate place where it was deployed is unknown. After the ninth century, Natori-dan engaged in the defense of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Chinju-fu (in ancient times).html">Chinju-fu</a> (Pacification and Defense Headquarters in ancient times) of Isawa-jo Castle. </p>
<p>A <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Gundan (army corps) (in ancient Japan).html">Gundan</a> system was enforced under <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Taiho Ritsuryo (Taiho Code).html">Taiho Ritsuryo</a> (Taiho Code) established in 701. Although the deployment of initial <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Gundan (army corps) (in ancient Japan).html">Gundan</a> is unknown, it is natural to consider that Natori-dan was deployed from old times because <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kokufu.html">Kokufu</a> (ancient provincial office/capital) of Mutsu Province was located at <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Koriyama Ruins.html">Koriyama Ruins</a> in Natori County at that time, and Natori-dan remained in the era of two <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Gundan (army corps) (in ancient Japan).html">Gundan</a> stated below. Since the eighth century was the time when a war with Ezo (northerners) got more serious, soldiers in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Gundan (army corps) (in ancient Japan).html">Gundan</a> also participated in the war naturally, but activities of each <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Gundan (army corps) (in ancient Japan).html">Gundan</a> was never known. </p>
<p>Activities in the 9th century show a history after the subjection of indigenous inhabitants in eastern Japan was settled by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUNYA no Watamaro.html">FUNYA no Watamaro</a> for the time being. First of all, the number of soldiers in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Gundan (army corps) (in ancient Japan).html">Gundan</a> of Mutsu Province was reduced from 4,000 to 2,000 in 811, and only 2,000 soldiers in total, 1,000 each for Tamatsukuri-dan (army corps in Tamatsukuri County, Mutsu Province) and Natori-dan, remained. </p>
<p>However, in August (old calendar) 815, Mutsu Province increased the number of troops and that of soldiers to 4 and 4,000, respectively, and always stationed 1,000 soldiers by having 6,000 soldiers in 6 troops in total work in 6 shifts. It is estimated that Natori-dan dispatched 500 defensive soldiers to Isawa-jo Castle and 100 defensive soldiers to Tamatsukuri fortress, as well as Tamatsukuri-dan and Oda-dan in the north. In concert with this, urushigami monjo (Lacquer documents) excavated from the site of Isawa-jo Castle for which the year of creation is unknown contained Myobo (identification) of personnel requisitioned from Shibata County. Since it is presumable that Shibata County was covered by Natori-dan geographically, it is considered that Myobo was for the Natori-dan stationed at Isawa-jo Castle. </p>
<p>Although the defense of Tamatsukuri fortress was abolished later, it is unknown when the abolishment was implemented. The number of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Gundan (army corps) (in ancient Japan).html">Gundan</a> of Mutsu Province was increased to seven troops with 7,000 soldiers by adding Iwaki-dan, and soldiers were allotted to seven <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Gundan (army corps) (in ancient Japan).html">Gundan</a> by increasing 1,000 soldiers in 843. Although the military strength after increasing soldiers of Natori-dan is unknown, Natori-dan continued to defend Isawa-jo Castle. </p>
<p>Thereafter, on May 4, 869, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/OSAKABE no Mototsugi.html">OSAKABE no Mototsugi</a> of Natori-dan was granted Ge-jugoinoge (Jugoinoge (Junior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade) given to persons outside <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>) along with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/ABENOMUTSU no Nagamune.html">ABENOMUTSU no Nagamune</a>, Gon no tairyo (Provisional Chief Administrative Officer) of Shibata County. </p>
<p>The <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Engishiki.html">Engishiki</a> (an ancient book for codes and procedures on national rites and prayers) compiled in the 10th century also specified the deployment of seven troops in Mutsu Province, but there are no historical materials to directly support their activities. Since there were no materials showing the activities by soldiers in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Gundan (army corps) (in ancient Japan).html">Gundan</a> in the Zenkunen War (the Early Nine Years' War) in the 11th century, it is considered that Natori-dan was abolished or lost substance completely before that time. </p>
