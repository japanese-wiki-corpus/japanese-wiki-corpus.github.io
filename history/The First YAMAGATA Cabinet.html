<h1>The First YAMAGATA Cabinet (第1次山縣内閣)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Since the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Constitution of the Empire of Japan.html">Constitution of the Empire of Japan</a> was enforced on November 29, the parliamentary system (Imperial Diet) was initiated in Japan during administration of this Cabinet. </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>This Cabinet was established after the KURODA Cabinet, which was fallen due to failure in negotiation for treaty revision. He abolished the Naikaku Shokken and introduced the Naikaku Kansei, to deny "Dai saiso (great prime minister)-ism" and position the prime minister as "the top among colleagues". He implemented such as issuance of the Imperial Rescript on Education, execution of the first general election of members of the House of Representatives (July 1), and introduction of prefecture/county system. </p>
<p>In the first Diet convened on November 25, 1890, YAMAGATA proposed substantial military budgets increase from the standpoint of his own belief, "Protection of sovereignty and defense of benefit line". This aroused antipathy of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Minto (literally, the peoples party).html">Minto</a> (political parties such as Liberal Party, Progressive Party and so on which conflicted with a han-dominated government when imperial Diet was inaugurated) which have been followed Movement for Liberty and People's Right and insisted on "Public's burden reduction/Government cost-cutting". Although the first budget had passed because some of Constitutional Liberal Party members (the Tosa School) approved the budget due to persuasion and corruption by the Minister of Agriculture and Commerce, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Munemitsu MUTSU.html">Munemitsu MUTSU</a> who was a Cabinet member but also close to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Minto (literally, the peoples party).html">Minto</a>, he had to accept implementation of Government cost-cutting policy. After the Diet was over, YAMAGATA submitted a letter of resignation because he had no confidence in Diet management. <h3>Period being in office</h3>
