<h1>Sanjo-ohashi Bridge Noticeboard Incident (三条制札事件)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Sanjo-ohashi Bridge Noticeboard Incident occurred on October 20, 1866 during the the end of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Edo Period.html">Edo Period</a>. The incident involved the Shinsengumi (a group who guarded <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> during the end of Tokugawa Shogunate), that maintained public order in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, attacking and capturing eight retainers of the Tosa clan who tried to pull out a noticeboard at Sanjo-ohashi Nishizume (the west foot of the Sanjo-ohashi bridge). </p>
<p>After their failure in the Baku-cho War (war between <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> and Choshu) carried out in 1865, the authority of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Edo bakufu.html">Edo bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>) collapsed, and in 1867, the noticeboards (that says Choshu clan is Emperor's enemy) placed by the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> were frequently pulled out in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. Notably, the noticeboard at the west foot of the Sanjo-ohashi bridge over Kamo-gawa river (Yodo-gawa river system) was pulled out and thrown into Kamo-gawa river three times, and Shinsengumi was ordered to guard the noticeboard. </p>
<p>Ordered to guard the noticeboard, Shinsengumi were ready to surrender criminals at any time by arranging members at three points centered around Sanjo-ohashi bridge. On the day of the incident, 12 members including <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Sanosuke HARADA.html">Sanosuke HARADA</a> waited in Sanjo <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kaisho (the early-modern times).html">kaisho</a> (a meeting place in Sanjo), 10 members including <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kuwajiro OISHI.html">Kuwajiro OISHI</a> waited in a merchant house, 12 members including <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Tadao ARAI.html">Tadao ARAI</a> waited in a liquor store, and two more members including <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kaoru ASANO.html">Kaoru ASANO</a> were arranged as patrols, waiting for the appearance of masterless <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a>. </p>
<p>On September 12 of the same year, while Shinsengumi was on guard, eight retainers of Tosa clan led by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kichigoro FUJISAKI.html">Kichigoro FUJISAKI</a> and Sukegoro MIYAGAWA appeared at Sanjo-ohashi Nishizume and moved as if to pull out the noticeboard. In response to the report of the appearance of the Tosa retainers, the group of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Sanosuke HARADA.html">Sanosuke HARADA</a> rushed to the scene. The group of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Tadao ARAI.html">Tadao ARAI</a> arrived later and further attacked the Tosa retainers who started to run away, giving the advantage to Shinsengumi. However, because <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kaoru ASANO.html">Kaoru ASANO</a>, on patrol, was afraid of the battle royal and his report to the group of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kuwajiro OISHI.html">Kuwajiro OISHI</a> was too late, the plan to surrender the Tosa retainers failed and consequently they secured their escape route. Kamaji ANDO, who fought as a rear guard of the Tosa retainers put up a fight and Shinsengumi ended up losing five out of the eight Tosa retainers. </p>
<p>After this incident, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kaoru ASANO.html">Kaoru ASANO</a> was accused for his cowardly behavior and ejected from Shinsengumi. The members in the battle were given reward grants from the Aizu Clan, including <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Sanosuke HARADA.html">Sanosuke HARADA</a> who was given 20 ryo (current unit). </p>
<p>This incident is sometimes referred to as the second largest arrest after the Ikedaya Incident in the history of Shinsengumi. </p>
<p>As an aside, there is a story that wearing a long sword was in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Fashion.html">fashion</a> among the Tosa retainers at the time, but the style was abolished as the Tosa retainers became aware of the awkwardness in using a long sword due to this incident. </p>
