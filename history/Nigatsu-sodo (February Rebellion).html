<h1>Nigatsu-sodo (February Rebellion) (二月騒動)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The Nigatsu-sodo refers to the incident that took place in March, 1272 (February, 1272 in old lunar calendar) in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period. </p>
<p>It was the incident that took place in the midst of confusions over the reply to the Mongol (Yuan [Dynasty]) letter that was delivered in 1266, and the guard against foreign countries. It was the internal conflict in the Hojo clan leading the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>) with the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/family/Tokuso.html">Tokuso</a> family (the direct line of the regency Hojo family) as its center. It was the incident in which <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Tokisuke HOJO.html">Tokisuke HOJO</a>, Rokuhara Tandai Minamikata (Southern Chief of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Rokuhara Tandai (an administrative and judicial agency in Rokuhara, Kyoto).html">Rokuhara Tandai</a>), the Hojo family (NAGOE family) of the Hojo clan, and others, who were believed to plan a rebellion against the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>, were subjugated by the order of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Regent.html">regent</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Tokimune HOJO.html">Tokimune HOJO</a>. Tokiaki HOJO and his younger brother, Noritoki HOJO, were killed in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> on March 18, and Tokisuke in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> on March 22. </p>
<p>As the result of this incident, the power opposed to the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/family/Tokuso.html">Tokuso</a> family was eliminated. However, it is noted as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yasumori ADACHI.html">Yasumori ADACHI</a>, a maternal relative, who addressed this incident, grew too powerful, his confrontation with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/TAIRA no Yoritsuna.html">TAIRA no Yoritsuna</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Miuchibito (Private Vassals of the Tokuso Family).html">Miuchibito</a> (private vassal of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/family/Tokuso.html">Tokuso</a>) became graver. </p>
<p>Progress of the Incident<br/>
<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Tokisuke HOJO.html">Tokisuke HOJO</a>, the RokuharaTandai Minamikata, who was the regent Tokimune's older brother by a concubine, was assigned the post of Rokuhara Tandai Minamikata, an administrative and judicial agency of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> to watch the Imperial Court in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, when Tokimune assumed the office of rensho (assistant to regents in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>) in 1264. Kitakata (Northern chief), ranking higher than Minamikata, was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Tokishige HOJO.html">Tokishige HOJO</a>, a younger brother of Nagatoki HOJO, who was the previous <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Regent.html">regent</a> before the last, who supported <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/family/Tokuso.html">Tokuso</a>. However, his successor had not been assigned since his death in 1270. </p>
<p>Tokisuke is said to have led <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Rokuhara.html">Rokuhara</a> with a coalition of the anti-Kamakura group. It is thought when the reaction of the Imperial Court to the Mongol letter was regarded as important, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> became more wary of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. When <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshimune HOJO.html">Yoshimune HOJO</a>, Nagatoki's son, took the post of Kitakata in January, 1272, he took measures to control the movements of the anti-Kamakura group, such as the confiscation of the shoryo (territory) of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yorikage ADACHI.html">Yorikage ADACHI</a>, who was a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Rokuhara.html">Rokuhara</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Hyojoshu (government post).html">hyojoshu</a> (a member of Council of State). </p>
<p>The Nagoe clan had been punished, because during the fifth <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Regent.html">regent</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Tokiyori HOJO.html">Tokiyori HOJO</a>'s era (1246 to 1256 in office), Mitsutoki HOJO (NAGOE) allied with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Yoritsune.html">FUJIWARA no Yoritsune</a>, together with his younger brothers, Tokiaki HOJO (NAGOE) and Noritoki HOJO (NAGOE) to attempt a rebellion (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Miya Sodo (Palace Disturbance).html">Miya Sodo</a> [the Palace Disturbance]). Kimitoki HOJO, Tokiaki's son, sided with them, which came to light in a while. Mitsutoki barely escaped death, and was banished to Izu, while Tokiaki and Noritoki were not blamed. As Noritoki, who was a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Hyojoshu (government post).html">hyojoshu</a>, was a close adviser to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Imperial Prince Munetaka.html">Imperial Prince Munetaka</a>, it is said he was being watched out, when the Imperial Prince was banished. </p>
<p>The existing <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Migyosho.html">migyosho</a> (documents for informing of decisions made by third or upper ranked authorities) shows hunting down was ordered by the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>, and led by the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Regent.html">regent</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Tokimune HOJO.html">Tokimune HOJO</a>, the rensho <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Masamura HOJO.html">Masamura HOJO</a>, who was the previous <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Regent.html">regent</a>, and others. Both Tokiaki NAGOE (Nyudo [lay-monk] Kensei) and Noritoki were killed in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> on March 18, 1272, and a court noble, Sanetaka NAKAMIKADO was punished. It is said Tokiaki was innocent of this incident, and hunting down and killing Tokiaki was wrong. After the incident, five pursuers who were <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/family/Tokuso.html">Tokuso</a>'s vassals were executed. Further, no reward or punishment was given for hunting down and killing Noritoki. The order of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> was sent to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> by post horse on March 22 in the same year, and Tokisuke was killed by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshimune HOJO.html">Yoshimune HOJO</a> (It is also said he escaped and ran away to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Yoshino.html">Yoshino</a>). </p>
