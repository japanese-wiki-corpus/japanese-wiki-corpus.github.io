<h1>Kujisen (公事銭)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kujisen was money paid in place of taxes in kind (including labor) as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Daisenno.html">daisenno</a> (paying dues in cash instead of in kind; commutation) for kuji (public duties) during Medieval Japan. It was also referred to as Koyosen and Kuji yakusen. </p>
<p>It was widespread, as money became circulating more rapidly due to agricultural production increase, and development of commerce, industry, and transportation; and in the Muromachi period, this name was also applied to kuji which was decided to be paid by money from the beginning. Kujisen was virtually collected for each title; therefore, for the city residents, taxes were collected by the titles of munebetsu sen (household tax), <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Jishi.html">jishi</a> sen (land tax), and mabechi sen (building and land tax), and for the market, taxes were collected by ichiba sen (marketplace tax), and zayaku sen (guild tax). </p>
