<h1><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> mimawarigumi (京都見廻組)</h1>
<p></p>
<p><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> mimawarigumi was an organization for maintaining public order in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, which was formed by the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>'s retainers at the end of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Edo Period.html">Edo Period</a> (end of Edo period). </p>
<p>In 1864, the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Edo bakufu.html">Edo bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>) appointed Hirotaka MAITA and Yasumasa MATSUDAIRA to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kyoto Mimawariyaku (a post of Kyoto patrols).html">Kyoto Mimawariyaku</a> under the command of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> shugoshoku (Military governor of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>). Afterwards, the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> mimawarigumi was founded with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Hatamoto (direct retainers of shogun).html">hatamoto</a> (direct retainer of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>) and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Gokenin.html">gokenin</a> (immediate vassal of the shogunate in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> and Muromachi through Edo periods) placed under the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kyoto Mimawariyaku (a post of Kyoto patrols).html">Kyoto Mimawariyaku</a>. It is said that the station was set by the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Nijo-jo Castle.html">Nijo-jo Castle</a>. The two Mimawariyaku respectively formed brigades under their command which were named after the official titles of the commanders as the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Sagami (poet).html">Sagami</a> no kami (governor of Sagami Province) brigade (Hirotaka MAITA) and the Izumo no kami (governor of Izumo Province) brigade (Yasumasa MATSUDAIRA) with about 200 soldiers under their command. </p>
<p>Along with Shinsengumi (a group who guarded <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> during the end of Tokugawa Shogunate), Mimawarigumi specialized in clamping down on those forces which opposed the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>, and not offenders. Mimawarigumi mainly covered the government office district including the imperial palace and the area around the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Nijo-jo Castle.html">Nijo-jo Castle</a>, while Shinsengumi covered towns for merchant class and amusement centers such as Gion and Sanjo. For this reason, it is highly unlikely that Shinsengumi and Mimawarigumi had the chance to establish a common front. </p>
<p><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Tadasaburo SASAKI.html">Tadasaburo SASAKI</a>, who was Kumigashira (the leader) of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Sagami (poet).html">Sagami</a> no kami brigade, and Kichitaro WATANABE, Yasujiro TAKAHASHI, Hayanosuke KATSURA, Nakazo DOHI, Daizaburo SAKURAI, and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Nobuo IMAI.html">Nobuo IMAI</a> are regarded as likely perpetrators of the assassination of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Ryoma SAKAMOTO.html">Ryoma SAKAMOTO</a>. </p>
