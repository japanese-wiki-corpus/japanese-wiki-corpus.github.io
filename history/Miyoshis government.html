<p></p>
<p>Miyoshi's government refers to a Japanese military government that existed from 1549 through 1568. Since the Miyoshi clan governed only a limited region, including Shikoku and Kinai, sometimes the Miyoshi's government is regarded just as one of the government of a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> in the Sengoku period. However, the facts that the Miyoshi's government governed <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, which was then the center of Japanese politics in Japan, that it controlled the shogunate government by making the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Muromachi Bakufu.html">Muromachi Bakufu</a> as puppet, and that it had the Imperial Court under their protection, differentiate it as a central government from other local government of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> in the same period. </p>
<p><h3>Establishment of the government</h3>
</p>
<p><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/family/The Miyoshi clan.html">The Miyoshi clan</a> was a family branched from the Ogasawara clan, the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a> (provincial constables) of Shinano Province. During the time of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yukinaga MIYOSHI.html">Yukinaga MIYOSHI</a>, the Miyoshi clan had the opportunity to expand their power to the Kinai region when they served Shogunal Deputy <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Katsumoto HOSOKAWA.html">Katsumoto HOSOKAWA</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Masamoto HOSOKAWA.html">Masamoto HOSOKAWA</a> and gained power. During the time of the confusion after the Eisho no Sakuran (assassination of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Masamoto HOSOKAWA.html">Masamoto HOSOKAWA</a>), Yukinaga sided <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Sumimoto HOSOKAWA.html">Sumimoto HOSOKAWA</a> and fought, but lost against <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Takakuni HOSOKAWA.html">Takakuni HOSOKAWA</a> and was executed. Other members of the Miyoshi clan also died in the battlefield or were executed, including Nagahide MIYOSHI. </p>
<p>The grandson of Yukinaga, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Motonaga MIYOSHI.html">Motonaga MIYOSHI</a> served Rokuro HOSOKAWA (later <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Harumoto HOSOKAWA.html">Harumoto HOSOKAWA</a>) and defeated <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Takakuni HOSOKAWA.html">Takakuni HOSOKAWA</a>. Then, the Miyoshi clan gained power to become senior vassal who practically supported the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/family/Hosokawa clan.html">Hosokawa clan</a>. In 1532, however, Motonaga was killed by Harumoto who believed the false charge made by Masanaga MIYOSHI. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/family/The Miyoshi clan.html">The Miyoshi clan</a> was allowed to have Motonaga as their heir, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Nagayoshi MIYOSHI.html">Nagayoshi MIYOSHI</a>, to take over the family head; however, since Nagayoshi was as young as 10 years old at that time, the Miyoshi clan temporarily retreated. </p>
<p>Nagayoshi became an intelligent and brave <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Busho.html">busho</a> (Japanese military commander) left a lot of military exploits as a vassal of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/family/Hosokawa clan.html">Hosokawa clan</a>, including at the suppression of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Nagamasa KIZAWA.html">Nagamasa KIZAWA</a> (the battle of the Taihei-ji Temple), battles against <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Ujitsuna HOSOKAWA.html">Ujitsuna HOSOKAWA</a> and Naganori YUSA. He then became the most powerful senior vassal under Harumoto who was given the post of local governor in 17 places in the Kinnai region, including Kawachi Province. </p>
<p>In 1548, Nagayoshi reconciled with Naganori YUSA and welcomed his daughter as his lawful wife, and at the same time, backed up <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Ujitsuna HOSOKAWA.html">Ujitsuna HOSOKAWA</a> and disobeyed Harumoto. This was because Harumoto and his senior vassal Masanaga MIYOSHI was his father's foe. In 1549, Harumoto and Nagayoshi fought against each other at the Battle of Eguchi and Nagayoshi won and Masanaga died. Harumoto and the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshiteru ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshiteru ASHIKAGA</a> who was backed up by Harumoto ran away to the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Omi Province.html">Omi Province</a>. The Hosokawa's government fell <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Apart (Apartment).html">apart</a> and then the Miyoshi's government was established. <h3>Expansion of power</h3>
</p>
<p>In 1552, Nagayoshi reconciled with <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshiteru ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshiteru ASHIKAGA</a> and welcomed Yoshiteru to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, and at the same time, he made <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Ujitsuna HOSOKAWA.html">Ujitsuna HOSOKAWA</a> as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kanrei.html">kanrei</a> (shogunal deputy). These two were puppets for Nagayoshi and here the Miyoshi's government with the powerful persons of the Muromachi <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kanrei.html">kanrei</a> practically began to function. However, the conflicts with the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshiteru ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshiteru ASHIKAGA</a>, who aimed to restore the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>) Japanese feudal government, continued. Nagayoshi kept expelling Yoshiteru to Omi and taking him back, meanwhile, Nagayoshi was attempted to be assassinated a few times. They finally reconciled in 1558, intermediated by the arrangement made by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshitaka ROKKAKU.html">Yoshitaka ROKKAKU</a>. </p>
<p>Nagayoshi expanded the territory to include Kinai and Shikoku regions, and formed a large territory consisting of more than 11 Provinces such as Yamashiro Province, Settsu Province, Awa Province, Sanuki Province, Harima Province, Iyo Province, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Tanba Province.html">Tanba Province</a>, Izumi Province, Awaji Province, Kawachi, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Yamato Province.html">Yamato Province</a>, and a part of Wakasa Province. Since the Imagawa clan controlled 3 provinces, the Takeda clan, Kai Province controlled 2, and the Mori clan, Aki Province controlled 4, the power of Nagayoshi was outstanding. <h3>The path to decline</h3>
</p>
<p>However, the Miyoshi's government, which passed a peak, began to decline in 1561. This year, the brave general of the Miyoshi's army Kazumasa SOGO, the younger brother and Nagayoshi who was called 'Oni Sogo,' died suddenly. In March 1562, Nagayoshi's another younger brother Yoshikata MIYOSHI died in a battle against the Hatakeyama clan. In August 1563, the heir of Nagayoshi, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshioki MIYOSHI.html">Yoshioki MIYOSHI</a> died. Many member of the powerful clan died one after another. </p>
<p>Also, Nagayoshi himself became carried away with literature such as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Renga.html">renga</a> (linked verse) and tossed up government affairs. Then he made a terrible mistake of letting adopted son-in-law <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Hisahide MATSUNAGA.html">Hisahide MATSUNAGA</a> to have the power to govern. Although the deaths of Kazumasa SOGO and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshioki MIYOSHI.html">Yoshioki MIYOSHI</a> were rumored to have been the assassination by Hisahide, Nagayoshi, who was heart broken by the deaths of his family, was too weak to notice the true nature of Hisahide. 
<br/>Therefore, Nagayoshi, who believed the false charge made by Hisahide and killed his younger brother Fuyuyasu ATAGI in May 1564, later realized that Fuyuyasu was innocent and fell sick, and died in July the same year (some speculate that Nagayoshi was assassinated by Hisahide)<br/>
<h3>Premeditated murder of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a></h3>
</p>
<p>After Nagayoshi's death, the family estate of the Miyoshi clan was taken over by the adopted son of Nagayoshi, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshitsugu ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshitsugu ASHIKAGA</a> (son of Kazumasa SOGO). However, since Yoshitsugu was young, the Miyoshi's government was established by the coalition government by Nagayuki MIYOSHI, Masayasu MIYOSHI, Tomomichi IWANARI (Yoshitsugu's guardians and Miyoshi Sanninshu (Miyoshi Triumvirate)) and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Hisahide MATSUNAGA.html">Hisahide MATSUNAGA</a>. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshiteru ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshiteru ASHIKAGA</a>, who was playing a puppet of Nagayoshi, took advantage of Nagayoshi's death, asked <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Kenshin UESUGI.html">Kenshin UESUGI</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Shingen TAKEDA.html">Shingen TAKEDA</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshikage ASAKURA.html">Yoshikage ASAKURA</a> and other <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> who had been close to Yoshiteru to go to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, and began to aggressively act for the restoration of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>. Hisahide and Miyoshi Sanninshu who sensed the danger in Yoshiteru's action caused a coup on May 19, 1565 and killed Yoshiteru at the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Nijo-jo Castle.html">Nijo-jo Castle</a> (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Eiroku Incident.html">Eiroku Incident</a>). </p>
<p>They placed Yoshiteru's cousin <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshihide ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshihide ASHIKAGA</a> as a new <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>. The coalition government of Matsunaga and Miyoshi continued to control the shogunate government even after the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> was replaced. <h3>Internal conflict and the collapse of the government</h3>
</p>
<p>However, the Miyoshi Sanninshu, who felt Hisahide's power was threatening, invaded to the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Yamato Province.html">Yamato Province</a> in cooperation with the local <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Yamato Province.html">Yamato Province</a>, including Junkei TSUTSUI who was drifting after Hisahide took over the Tsutsui-jo Castle (at the Battle of Tsutsui-jo Castle), and tried to kill Hisahide. This caused the conflict between the Miyoshi Sanninshu and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Hisahide MATSUNAGA.html">Hisahide MATSUNAGA</a> become more serious. </p>
<p>At first Miyoshi Sanninshu who were backed up by the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshihide ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshihide ASHIKAGA</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshitsugu MIYOSHI.html">Yoshitsugu MIYOSHI</a>, the family head of the Miyoshi family, called out the troops in Shikoku region and they were overwhelmingly dominating. However, Hisahide attacked the Miyoshi's army which was lined up at the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Kofuku-ji Temple.html">Kofuku-ji Temple</a> on October 10, 1567, and fought off them by setting a fire to the Daibutsu-den Hall (the Great Buddha hall) of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Todai-ji Temple.html">Todai-ji Temple</a> (warrior clashes at the Great Buddha Hall of Todai-ji temple); the battle was a seesaw war. </p>
<p>While the Miyoshi's government kept having the internal conflict, the younger brother of Yoshiteru, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshiaki ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshiaki ASHIKAGA</a>, who was on the run with the support by vassals such as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yusai HOSOKAWA.html">Yusai HOSOKAWA</a> due to the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Eiroku Incident.html">Eiroku Incident</a>, gained support by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Nobunaga ODA.html">Nobunaga ODA</a>, who governed the Owari Province and the Mino Province and was on a roll, and headed to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> in September 1568. The Miyoshi's government which was busy with the internal conflict, tried to stop Nobunaga's invasion by giving a Kanryo <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Shoku.html">shoku</a> (a post of Chief Adviser) to Yoshikata ROKKAKU so that he would take the side with the Miyoshi's government. However, Rokkaku lost by the invasion of Nobunaga. </p>
<p>Thus, the Miyoshi Sanninshu and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Hisahide MATSUNAGA.html">Hisahide MATSUNAGA</a> ceased their fights and get together against Nobunaga. However, the Miyoshi's army had already became weak due to the internal conflict and they could not control their army, and lost without really fighting against the Oda army. By this, the Miyoshi's government, which controlled the central government over 20 years, collapsed in just 2 weeks. </p>
<p>Later, Yoshitsubu MIYOSHI and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Hisahide MATSUNAGA.html">Hisahide MATSUNAGA</a> surrendered to Nobunaga and became his vassals. However, Yoshitsugu was killed by Nobunaga in 1573 and Hisahide also in October 1577. The Miyoshi Sanninshu resisted against Nobunaga but were defeated by 1573. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/family/The Miyoshi clan.html">The Miyoshi clan</a> lost their power in the Kinai region and only Nagaharu MIYOSHI, Yasunaga MIYOSHI, Masayasu SOGO and Nobuyasa ATAGI remained to have power in the Shikoku region. Miyoshi clan's power over the Shikoku region also declined due to internal conflict and surrender to Nobunaga, and they managed to survive under the protection of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Oda government.html">Oda government</a>. <h3>Structure of the government</h3>
</p>
<p>Miyoshi's government was a military government which succeeded the old government structure of the Muromachi <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>. The facts that the Miyoshi's government made the most use of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> functions such as by taking control of the shogunate government by placing <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> as a puppet and by controlling <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> by giving important roles in the government as honory positions clearly show it. Therefore, the internal structure of the Miyoshi's government was very vulnerqable. The government was established only by the talent of Nagayoshi himself and the existence of the limited number of personnel, including Nagayoshi's younger brother Yoshikata MIYOSHI, Fuyuyasu ATAGI, Kazumasa SOGO and his heir <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshioki MIYOSHI.html">Yoshioki MIYOSHI</a>. </p>
<p>In terms of the economic power, they had surpassing power over other <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> by taking Sakai under their control. However, the Miyoshi clan did not have goson (autonomous village) as their direct control territory and was just having the Imperial Court and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> under their control. Because the Miyoshi government succeeded the previous <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> (manor) system and the system of the Muromachi <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>, their economic structure was extremely vulnerable. Also, they took the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Suigun.html">Suigun</a> (warriors battle in the sea) in the Shikoku region under their control by having Fuyuyasu being adopted by the Atagi clan and Kazumasa being adopted by the Sogo clan. This supported the military power of the Miyoshi clan. Since the Miyoshi clan was originally like a leader of the local ruling families of the Awa Province, the military power of Awa Province and Sanuki Province was essential for them to maintain their power in the Kinai region. However, the continued deaths of the Miyoshi clan such as Kazumasa and Yoshitaka accelerated their power over the Shikoku region losing substance, which eventually led to the decline of the military force of the Miyoshi's army. </p>
<p>Also, Nagayoshi tried to maintain their close relationships with the Imperial Court and temples and shrines by holding <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Renga.html">renga</a> often. This was meant to take advantage of the religious network in the Kinai region because many of the Kugeshu (court nobles) in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Machi-shu.html">machi-shu</a> (towns people) in Sakai were believers of the Hokke sect. However, this caused Nagayoshi to devote himself to literature, which led to the death of Nagayoshi, internal conflict within the Miyoshi clan, and eventually to the fall of the Miyoshi's government. </p>
