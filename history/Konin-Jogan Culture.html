<h1>Konin-Jogan Culture (弘仁・貞観文化)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Konin-Jogan culture is considered in Japanese history to be the culture that flourished in Japan during the Konin and Jogan era of the early Heian period (about the ninth century). This period is called the Konin-Jogan Period. In Japanese art history, the term 'Konin-Jogan Culture' has become less common from the end of the twentieth century, and the term 'early Heian period' is commonly used. </p>
