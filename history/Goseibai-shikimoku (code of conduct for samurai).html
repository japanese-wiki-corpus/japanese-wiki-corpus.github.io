<h1>Goseibai-shikimoku (code of conduct for samurai) (御成敗式目)</h1>

<div class="social" id="social-header" style="text-align: left;margin-left: -7px;min-height: 30px;">
	<div class="fb-like" data-href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Goseibai-shikimoku (code of conduct for samurai).html" data-width="" data-layout="button_count" data-action="like" data-size="small" data-share="true"></div>
</div>

<p>Goseibai-shikimoku is a law code established for <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> government in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period. Because it was established in the first year of Joei era in 1232, it is also called Joei-shikimoku. </p>
<p>The name Joei-shikimoku was created later, so it is better to call it Goseibai-shikimoku officially. It is also called Kanto Goseibai-shikimoku, Kanto Buke-shikimoku and so on. </p>
<p>History<br/>
When <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>) was formed, there was no statutory law yet; however, it did not follow the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Ritsuryo.html">ritsuryo</a> law or the kugeho (laws issued by the Imperial Court) and the trials were held according to orders and precedents of morals which had been practiced by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> since the birth of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a>. However, because <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Mandokoro.html">Mandokoro</a>, the Office of Administration, and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Monchujo.html">Monchujo</a>, the Office of Inquiry of early <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> were operated by people of the middle-ranked nobles from <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> with knowledge of Myobodo (study of Codes) and kugeho, the usage of the law accumulated by the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> was not established unrelated to the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Ritsuryo.html">ritsuryo</a> law and the kugeho. </p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> expanded its power to the western provinces after the Jokyu War, and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Gokenin.html">gokenin</a> (immediate vassals of the shogunate in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> and Muromachi through Edo periods) and court nobles who were sent as jito (manager and lord of manor) had more legal troubles with lords of private estates and the local public. Also it can be given that a huge number of precedents and usage of the law were formed and became complicated after almost a half century since the establishment of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>. </p>
<p>Therefore, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Regent.html">regent</a> to the shogunate <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yasutoki HOJO.html">Yasutoki HOJO</a> took charge in establishing the Goseibai-shikimoku by consulting with some of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Hyojoshu (government post).html">hyojoshu</a> (a member of Council of State) including Yasutsura OTA and Joen SAITO with assistance of the family patriarch <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Tokifusa HOJO.html">Tokifusa HOJO</a>. </p>
<p>Regarding the establishment, regent Yasutoki wrote two letters ('Yasutoki shosokubun') to his younger brother <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Shigetoki HOJO.html">Shigetoki HOJO</a> who was stationed at <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Rokuhara Tandai (an administrative and judicial agency in Rokuhara, Kyoto).html">Rokuhara Tandai</a> (an administrative and judicial agency in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Rokuhara.html">Rokuhara</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>) in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, stating the spirit and purpose of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shikimoku.html">shikimoku</a> (law code). </p>
<p>When it was established, court nobles already had the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Ritsuryo.html">Ritsuryo</a> codes which mentioned the political system, but there were no clear laws and ordinances for <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> families. Therefore, based on conventions of shogunal retainers since <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Yoritomo.html">MINAMOTO no Yoritomo</a> and agreements which had until then not clearly been stated, properties such as land and authorities of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a> (military governors) and jito were stipulated. According to 'Yasutoki shosokubun,' they created a law written in understandable style to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> since the kugeho was written in kanbun (Chinese classics) and difficult to understand. Accordingly, its characteristic is more of a law that was established to be supported by shogunal retainers than that which was established by the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> with an iron fist. Also, although the law was established by the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>, it didn't work to the advantage of shogunal retainers, but it was operated fairly to every party to a suit. Therefore suits using the Goseibai-shikimoku were also accepted by higokenin (non-vassals) such as court nobles, temples and shrines who were the lords of private estates and a part of those were adopted also in the kugeho. After the fall of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>, it continued to work as the fundamental law of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> until <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Edo bakufu.html">Edo bakufu</a> established Buke shohatto (Laws for the Military Houses). </p>
<p>It greatly affected family laws of Muromachi <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> and the Sengoku period (Japan); it not only became the base of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bukeho.html">bukeho</a> (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> laws) but also was studied as great precedents of yusoku kojitsu (studies in ancient court and military practices and usages) by people, whether as court nobles or <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> families ('<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shikimoku.html">Shikimoku</a> chushakugaku'). After that, in the Edo period, it became widespread as a text book of calligraphy also among the general public. </p>
<p>According to Yasutoki shosokubun, it was called shikijo first, but changed to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shikimoku.html">shikimoku</a> in consideration of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Ritsuryo.html">ritsuryo</a> codes. </p>
<p>Provisions<br/>
It included 51 articles. The number of articles was 3 times of 17, derived from Seventeen-Article Constitution. </p>
<p>We give some major articles here. </p>
<p>Article 3: Shugonin-bugyo (post of provincial constable in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period) in various districts<br/>
Article 7: Territories<br/>
Article 8: Possession of land<br/>
Article 9: Rebels<br/>
Article 10: Crimes of murder and bodily injury<br/>
Article 12: Charge of abuse<br/>
Article 13: Charge of violence<br/>
</p>
<p>To make up flaw and respond to new situations, additional laws were established occasionally, which were called 'addition of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shikimoku.html">shikimoku</a>' or just 'addition.'<br/>
In Yasutoki shosokubun it was written 'any other shortages should be added to write in the future,' indicating the necessity of additional laws from the beginning. </p>
<p>Bugyonin (magistrates) of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> and Muromachi periods collected necessary additional laws and compiled a lot of additional laws including 'Shinpentsuika' which has been passed down to the present. Those transcription and published books were compared in Volume 1 of "A Collection of the Historical Material on the History of Law System in Medieval Ages" compiled by Shinichi SATO and Yoshisuke IKEUCHI. </p>
<p><h3>Contents</h3>
</p>
<p>It was the fundamental law of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> and the first <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bukeho.html">bukeho</a> in Japan. It was based on the precedents ('Udaishoke no rei' [precedents of the family of Udaisho (Major Captain of the Right Division of Inner Palace Guards)]) since the era of Yoritomo and the morals of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> society, and included many regulations of right, obligation and territory succession of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Gokenin.html">gokenin</a>. The regulations of 'Kuikaeshiken' (a right to take back title to property) and '<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Nenkiho (a legal principle for the statute of limitations).html">Nenkiho</a>' (a legal principle for the statute of limitations on land in possession, which developed under <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bukeho.html">bukeho</a>) are considered as unique regulations to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> family (there is also other theory). However, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shikimoku.html">shikimoku</a> was applied only to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> society; kugeho was applied under the control of Imperial Court while <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Honjo (proprietor or guarantor of manor).html">honjo</a> (proprietor or guarantor of manor) law came into effect under the influence of the lords of private estates. On the other hand, under the control of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>, kugeho and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Honjo (proprietor or guarantor of manor).html">honjo</a> law were rejected as not applicable. Also, it is a generally accepted view that Goseibai-shikimoku is a declaration of independence of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> law as it is recognized that Goseibai-shikimoku, backed by the precedents since the time of Yoritomo and the morals of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> society, actively and independently established provisions which were different from or sometimes went against the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Ritsuryo.html">ritsuryo</a> law or the kugeho. </p>
<p>However, there is also criticism to such a view. According to Ichiro NITTA (legal expert), the part which wrote about the precedents since the time of Yoritomo and the morals of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> society and especially most of the part which opposed to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Ritsuryo.html">Ritsuryo</a> law and kugeho were not included in the articles, but were only mentioned in the forms of details and exceptions, while most of the matters not related to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> in the articles were based on the kugeho in the early <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period. Also he pointed out that those who took part in the compilation were Yasutoki and Tokifusa of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Rokuhara Tandai (an administrative and judicial agency in Rokuhara, Kyoto).html">Rokuhara Tandai</a> and middle-ranked nobles with knowledge of the kugeho and the descendants who were shogunal retainers. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">Samurai</a> (especially shogunal retainers) at that time were easily involved in problems with court nobles who were lords of private estates where they (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a>) worked as jito; Goseibai-shikimoku was established in order to save <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> from such problems by making them understand the summary of legal order of the time centered in the kugeho and by working in harmony with the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> society, therefore the reason was not to systemize the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bukeho.html">bukeho</a> or to make a new order of law based on the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bukeho.html">bukeho</a>; the kugeho was said to be still the base and was regarded as a formal model and material. Also since the late <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period, it was also accepted by the court noble society, he pointed out that the back ground was the common policy goal of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> and Imperial Court to realize the principle of the rule by virtue of the sovereign through benevolent rule. </p>
<p>The characteristics of Goseibai-shikimoku was that it had many regulations regarding possession; what is noteworthy is that the Article 8 included a principle 'those who do not enforce their rights will not be protected,' and there are also many others which can be said the origin of Japanese law. </p>
<p>Shinichi SATO expressed his opinion to seek the origin of '20-year occupation' of Civil Code Article 162 in Goseibai-shikimoku. However, according to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Kenjiro UME.html">Kenjiro UME</a>, one of the drafting committee members of Minpoten (the legal code that stipulates basic regulations related to Civil Code), in Old Civil Codes drawn up by Gustave Emile BOISSONADE it was stipulated as 30 years based on the legislation of the time, but it became easier to figure out distant properties thanks to better transportation and also it was necessary to determine the rights more quickly because of more frequent transactions, it was shortened to 20 years, and he didn't mention the links to the old law in Japan. </p>
