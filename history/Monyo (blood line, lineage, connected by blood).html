<p>The term "monyo" generally referred to families that were related by blood. Later, it was also used for the rank name in reference to a social status among vassals who were related by similar blood. </p>

<p>Gomonyo (a family with honorary status)<br/>
The term "gomonyo" referred to those who, among the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Seiwa-Genji (Minamoto clan).html">Seiwa-Genji</a> (Minamoto clan), were treated as a family of Kamakura-dono (Lord of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a>) in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>). In the period of three generations of the Genji shogunate family, from <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Yoritomo.html">MINAMOTO no Yoritomo</a> to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Sanetomo.html">MINAMOTO no Sanetomo</a>, the Genji clans that belonged to the same clan of Kamakura-dono existed in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kawachi-Genji.html">Kawachi-Genji</a> (Minamoto clan) in a restricted sense and in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Seiwa-Genji (Minamoto clan).html">Seiwa-Genji</a> in a broad sense, but not all Genji clans were always treated as the family of Kamakura-dono because the loyalty to Kamakura-dono was highly valued and dependence on the family was not permitted. </p>
<p>Many Genji clans, except for the conferment of a court rank and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Appointment (Ninkan).html">appointment</a> to an office, were forbidden to broadly <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Share.html">share</a> a common Minamoto family name in the same way as the Kamakura-dono, and were treated simply as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kenin.html">Kenin</a> (retainers). </p>
<p>When <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Yoritomo.html">MINAMOTO no Yoritomo</a> established the military government in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a>, Yoritomo allowed those who had been credited for their distinguished services among the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Seiwa-Genji (Minamoto clan).html">Seiwa-Genji</a> the permission to use the Minamoto family name, but he prohibited other Genji clans from using the name at formal occasions. Monyo originated from six people who were appointed as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kokushi.html">Kokushi</a> (provincial governors) at <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Jimoku (ceremony for appointing officials).html">Jimoku</a> (ceremony for the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Appointment (Ninkan).html">appointment</a> of officials) on August 16, 1185 (old lunar calendar). Families that were acknowledged as monyo were called gomonyo and treated second to the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> family in social status; this drew the line at other <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Gokenin.html">gokenin</a> (an immediate vassal of the shogunate in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> and Muromachi through Edo periods). Therefore, it was considered a great honor to be acknowledged as a gomonyo. </p>
<p>In fact, the first six people had been recommended before Yoritomo got onto bad terms with <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Yoshitsune.html">MINAMOTO no Yoshitsune</a>. Also, the relationship between Yoritomo and Yoshitsune was strained at the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Point (Sentoki).html">point</a> that <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Jimoku (ceremony for appointing officials).html">Jimoku</a> was made public, so Yoshitsune wasn't factually acknowledged as a gomonyo. Given the manner in which the members of these monyo were selected, in order to be given the status of monyo, what mattered wasn't the main line or branch of the family blood nor how close one was to Yoritomo's blood but was instead being the faithful <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Seiwa-Genji (Minamoto clan).html">Seiwa-Genji</a>, which was the only requirement. </p>
<p>Yoritomo's own younger brothers, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Noriyori.html">MINAMOTO no Noriyori</a>, Zenjo ANO and Yoshitsune, weren't included in these monyo, while those included were limited to Yoshinori YAMANA, a child born out of wedlock of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/family/Nitta clan.html">Nitta clan</a>, among the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kawachi-Genji.html">Kawachi-Genji</a> that had relatively close blood ties with Yoritomo, and Yoshikane ASHIKAGA; however, those who were distantly related were also included, such as Tomitsu KAGAMI of the Kai-Genji that had descended from <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Yorimitsu.html">MINAMOTO no Yorimitsu</a>, the younger brother of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Yoshiie.html">MINAMOTO no Yoshiie</a>, the ancestor of four generations before Yoritomo, and Yoshisuke YASUDA; and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Aritsuna.html">MINAMOTO no Aritsuna</a> of the Settsu-Genji (Minamoto clan), which was descended from <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Yorimitsu.html">MINAMOTO no Yorimitsu</a>, the elder brother of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Yorinobu.html">MINAMOTO no Yorinobu</a>, the originator of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kawachi-Genji.html">Kawachi-Genji</a>, the ancestor of six generations before. </p>
