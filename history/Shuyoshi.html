<h1>Shuyoshi (主鷹司)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Shuyoshi (Falcons Office) refers to an institution that belonged to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Hyobusho (Ministry of Military).html">Hyobusho</a> (Ministry of Military) in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ritsuryo.html">Ritsuryo</a> system (a system of centralized government based on the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ritsuryo.html">ritsuryo</a> code). It was called Takatsukasa or Takanotsukasa in a Japanese way. </p>
<p><h3>Official duties</h3>
</p>
<p>Shuyoshi, also called hoyoshi, raised and trained falcons and hunting dogs, and had complete control over hunting such as falconry and so on. It was lowest in rank among the shi (Offices), and for <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shitokan (four classifications of bureaucrats ranks).html">Shitokan</a> (four classifications of bureaucrats' ranks), only Kami (Director) and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Sakan (Kokushi).html">Sakan</a> (Secretary) were established. Actually, Takako of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shinabe (Technicians in Offices).html">Shinabe</a> (technicians in offices) was in charge of raising falcons. </p>
<p>Due to the Buddhist thought of 'ahimsa,' Shuyoshi was abolished in 721, and in a period from 764 to 769 under <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Dokyo.html">Dokyo</a>'s government, and then Hojoshi (literally, office of returning animals to nature) was established. Shuyoshi was revived in the Enryaku era, but it was abolished practically because nobody came to be appointed as government posts of Shuyoshi from 861 due to part of downsizing measures. The rearing of falcons was taken over by Takagai (hawker) of Kurododokoro (the Chamberlain's Office). <h3>Personnel</h3>
