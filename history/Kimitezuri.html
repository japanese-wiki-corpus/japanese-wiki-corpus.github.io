<h1>Kimitezuri (君手摩)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kimitezuri is commonly regarded as a guardian god of the Ryukyu Kingdom that rules the sea and the sun. It is said that the god descends when Ryukyu Kingdom is in a fateful crisis. Kimitezuri is believed to live in Niraikanai paradise (located deep in the sea, beyond the sea, or underground), and to take possession of the Kikoe Okimi (chief-priestesses) during the enthronement ceremony of a new king. </p>
<p>The first historical record referring to Kimitezuri as the name of a god is Chuzanseikan (literally, Mirror of the Ages of Chuzan) compiled by Joken SHO (Choshu HANEJI). </p>
<p>However, since 'kimi' generally means female priest (Noro) who administers religious rites in Ryukyu, and 'tezuri' means rubbing one's hands at the time of prayer, Kimitezuri is interpreted as a name of a religious ceremony, not as the name of a god in a different theory. </p>
