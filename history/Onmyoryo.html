<h1>Onmyoryo (陰陽寮)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The Onmyoryo was one of the bureaus in Nakatsukasasho (Ministry of Central Affairs) under the Ritsuryo system (a system of centralized government based on the ritsuryo code). The department was responsible for the compilation of fortune-telling, astronomy, time, and calendar. It was renamed the 'Taishi department' (Bureau of Divination) between 758 and 764. </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>The Onmyo no Kami was the director of the bureau which was staffed by Onmyoji (yin and yang practitioners) who performed spells based on Onmyodo (way of Yin and Yang; an occult divination system based on the Taoist theory of the five elements). There was also an Onmyo Hakase (ying and yang master) who trained onmyoji, a Tenmon Hakase (master of astronomy) who practiced and taught astronomy, and a Reki Hakase (calendar master) who compiled and created calendars. Gakusei (students) and tokugyo no sho (student like postgraduate, student taking the graduate program) studied under these staff members. In addition, the Rokoku Hakase (clock master) managed the water clocks and announced the time. The Onmyoji ABE no Seimei was assigned to one of the institution's Tenmon Hakase. The Onmyo no Kami Haruo TSUCHIMIKADO passed away in 1869, and the Onmyoryo was abolished in 1870 during the time of his heir, Harenaga TSUCHIMIKADO. <h3>Personnel</h3>
