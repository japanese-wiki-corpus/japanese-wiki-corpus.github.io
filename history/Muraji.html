<h1>Muraji (é€£)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Muraji refers to one of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kabane (hereditary title).html">kabane</a> (hereditary title to denote rank and political standing) used in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yamato.html">Yamato</a> sovereignty (the ancient Japan sovereignty) and also denoted one of the highest ranked titles among retainers. </p>
<p>Muraji is said to be the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kabane (hereditary title).html">kabane</a> granted to some of the influential clans who were under the direct control of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yamato.html">Yamato</a> sovereignty from early times, and they held special official posts or were in charge of managing the occupations. The influential clans who called themselves Muraji included the Otomo clan and the Mononobe clan. </p>
<p>According to the "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan).html">Nihonshoki</a>" (Chronicles of Japan), many clans who called themselves Muraji could be descendants of the gods other than those of the Imperial Family's. </p>
<p>Unlike the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kabane (hereditary title).html">kabane</a> of Omi that were mostly the influential ruling clans in the capital, the clans with the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kabane (hereditary title).html">kabane</a> of Muraji were directly connected to the posts of the Imperial Court and it is said that the Otomo and the Mononobe clans were those who were in charge of the military affairs for the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yamato.html">Yamato</a> sovereignty from ancient times. </p>
<p>The most influential people among the clans with the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kabane (hereditary title).html">kabane</a> of Muraji were called <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Omuraji (ancient Japan).html">Omuraji</a> (ancient Japan), who were put in charge of the affairs of state along with people called Oomi (ancient Japan), who were the influential people among the clans with the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kabane (hereditary title).html">kabane</a> of Omi. </p>
<p>By the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yakusa no Kabane (the eight honorary titles).html">Yakusa no Kabane</a> (the eight honorary titles) reform by the Emperor Tenmu, the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kabane (hereditary title).html">kabane</a> of Muraji was demoted to the seventh highest, and afterwards Ason (or <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Asomi.html">Asomi</a>) became the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kabane (hereditary title).html">kabane</a> title for influential clans. </p>
