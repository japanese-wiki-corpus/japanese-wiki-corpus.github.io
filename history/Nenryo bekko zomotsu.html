<h1>Nenryo bekko zomotsu (年料別貢雑物)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Nenryo bekko zomotsu was the system where a designated amount of Zomotsu such as paper, brushes, horse skin and herbal plants were directly tithed to the central government by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ritsuryo.html">Ritsuryo</a> provinces. In the case of herbal plants, it was especially called Nenryo <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Zoyaku.html">zoyaku</a>. </p>
<p>Originally, specialty goods from each province were sent as Soyocho tithes to the central government and consumed there but it is considered that this system was established to make up a shortfall. There are various theories regarding collection method; collection at the local area using So, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shozei (the rice tax stored in provincial offices warehouse).html">Shozei</a> (rice tax) and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Jishi.html">Jishi</a> trade (trade between tax [rice] and specialty goods), and labor for production with Zoyo are considered possibilities. </p>
<p>"<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Engishiki.html">Engishiki</a>" (an ancient book for codes and procedures on national rites and prayers) states that the target was 43 provinces within the entire nation, excluding Kinai and some small fringe provinces. </p>
