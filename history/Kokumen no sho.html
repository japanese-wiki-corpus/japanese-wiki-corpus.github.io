<h1>Kokumen no sho (国免荘)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kokumen no sho (also referred to as Kokumensho) was a kind of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> (manor in medieval Japan) during the late Heian period which was exempt from miscellaneous taxes by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kokushi.html">kokushi</a> (provincial governor). </p>
<p>During the late Heian period, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kokushi.html">kokushi</a> became influential in the provincial government and assumed the authority to decide shoekimenjo (exemption of miscellaneous taxes) on Arata (also referred to as Areta; rice field of low grade) and the like. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kokushi.html">Kokushi</a> managed to extend his influence even to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> that had already been granted <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Fuyu no ken (Japan).html">Fuyu no ken</a> (the right of tax exemption, Japan) and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Funyu no ken (Japan).html">Funyu no ken</a> (the right to keep the tax agents from entering the property, Japan), which had resulted in Kokumen no sho. </p>
<p>Since <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kokushi.html">kokushi</a> gave such treatment entirely at his discretion, that exemption could be cancelled by a newly assigned <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kokushi.html">kokushi</a>. Therefore, the lords of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> wanted their lands to be granted a much stronger Kanshofu sho (a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> enjoying immunity from taxation by virtue of having official documents from both the Council of State and the Ministry of Popular Affairs) or Chokumen sho (imperially exempted manor). </p>
