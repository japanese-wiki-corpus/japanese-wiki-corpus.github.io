<h1>Togubo (Crown Prince's Quarters) (春宮坊)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Togubo existed in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ritsuryo.html">Ritsuryo</a> system (a system of centralized government based on the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ritsuryo.html">ritsuryo</a> code) in ancient Japan. </p>
<p><h3>Official duties</h3>
</p>
<p>The official duty of Togubo was to see domestic economy of the Crown Prince. The institution imitated the domestic governing institution of the Crown Prince, Chunfang (the palace of the crown prince) in the Tang Dynasty. In the Tang Dynasty, each institution related with the Crown Prince was half independent and formed one Imperial Court and thus togubo was also independent from each authority in the form. However, in fact, it was put under the strong management of Daijokan (Grand Council of State). </p>
<p>The domestic economy of the Crown Prince was, in fact, managed by each institution under Togubo. Each institution is as follows. </p>
<p>Shuzengen (section of food). Shuzogen (section of clothing). Tonerigen (the office of servants of the crown prince). </p>

<p>Gen and sho were special forms of bureaus. Later, Crown Prince's chamberlain, Tachihaki no toneri (guard of the Imperial Palace) and so on were put. </p>
