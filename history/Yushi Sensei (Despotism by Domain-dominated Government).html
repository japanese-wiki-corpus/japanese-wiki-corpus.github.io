<h1>Yushi Sensei (Despotism by Domain-dominated Government) (有司専制)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Yushi Sensei is a term criticizing the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> government for their domain cliques and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Transcendentalism.html">transcendentalism</a>. </p>
<p>In 1874 <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Taisuke ITAGAKI.html">Taisuke ITAGAKI</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Shojiro GOTO.html">Shojiro GOTO</a> submitted "the Petition for Establishment of Minsen Giin (An Elected Assembly)" to the government. 
<br/>The term derives from the following passage in the petition: 'As we observe how the present government fares, it resides neither in the emperor above nor in the people below, but it solely belongs to '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yushi (privately adopted child).html">Yushi</a>.'<br/>
'<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yushi (privately adopted child).html">Yushi</a>' refers to governmental officials. The state of affair was such that only the bureaucrats got together to determine national policies without resort to parliamentary government. It severely criticized contradiction to the spirit of "The <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Charter Oath of Five Articles.html">Charter Oath of Five Articles</a>" which emphasized 'open discussion' by the public. Later the term was used as a slogan for criticizing the government and requesting the establishment of a parliament in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Jiyu Minken Undo (Freedom and popular rights movement).html">Jiyu Minken Undo</a> (Movement for Liberty and People's Rights). </p>
