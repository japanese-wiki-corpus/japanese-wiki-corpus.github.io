<p>The Battle of Toba-Fushimi from January 27 to 30, 1868 was the beginning of the Boshin War, and was fought in Kamitoba (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Minami Ward (Kyoto City).html">Minami Ward</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>) on the outskirts of southern <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, Shimotoba, Takeda, and Fushimi (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Fushimi Ward.html">Fushimi Ward</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>). </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>At the end of 1867, jikan-nochi (resignation from the government post and retrocession of the domain) was ordered against Yoshinobu TOKUGAWA of the former Tokugawa Shogunate family, who had retreated to Osaka due to the restoration of Imperial rule (in Japan), was initiated by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Toshimichi OKUBO.html">Toshimichi OKUBO</a> of the Satsuma domain and the court noble, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Tomomi IWAKURA.html">Tomomi IWAKURA</a>. When the Satsuma domain was engaged provocatively in subversive activities (the Incident of setting fire to the residence in Edo of domain of Satsuma, inflicted by the Shonai domain) in the urban area of Edo, the surroundings of Yoshinobu increasingly voiced the desire to defeat the Satsuma domain and accordingly, Yoshinobu attempted to establish a military blockade of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. The Shogunate infantry, the main force of the former Shogunate forces, advanced on the Toba-kaido Highway, while the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shinsengumi.html">Shinsengumi</a> and the soldiers of the Aizu and Kuwana domains advanced to the urban area of Fushimi. </p>
<p>In the afternoon of January 27, 1868, a quarrel between the inspector general, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Tomoaki TAKIGAWA.html">Tomoaki TAKIGAWA</a> and the soldiers of the Satsuma domain blocking the highway near Shimotoba resulted in a battle, and as soon as gunfire in Toba was heard, the battle in Fushimi began. In Toba (the suburbs of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>), the absence of the supreme commander Shigekata TAKENAKA and the escape of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Tomoaki TAKIGAWA.html">Tomoaki TAKIGAWA</a> threw the former Shogunate forces into disarray, and near the magistrate's office in Fushimi, the former Shogunate infantry led by the commanding officers, Nobuhisa SAKUMA and Shigeaki KUBOTA, the soldiers of the Aizu domain, and the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shinsengumi.html">Shinsengumi</a> led by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Toshizo HIJIKATA.html">Toshizo HIJIKATA</a>, were defeated by the firepower of the rifles in the new government's forces. </p>
<p>On January 29, the Shogunate forces, which were refused entry to the castle of the Yodo domain (see below), set up camp in Yodo-Senryomatsu, but were severely defeated. Incidentally, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Genzaburo INOUE.html">Genzaburo INOUE</a>, a ranking officer of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shinsengumi.html">Shinsengumi</a> since its foundation, was killed during the intense battle. </p>
<p>The Shogunate forces were routed repeatedly, but, finally, they were to fight the final, decisive battle fought at two positions: to the east and west of Mt. Otoko-yama in which the Iwashimizu Hachimangu Shrine was located. The main units of the Shogunate forces, including the main force of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shinsengumi.html">Shinsengumi</a> led by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Toshizo HIJIKATA.html">Toshizo HIJIKATA</a>, set up camp in Hashimoto, a posting station with a red-light district, to the west of the mountain. In Hashimoto, where Mt. Otoko-yama lay to the east and the Yodo-gawa River to the west, the Shogunate forces had a geographical advantage against counter attacks. However, betrayed by the Tsu domain guarding Oyamazaki across the river (see below) and consequently subjected to unexpected heavy fire from the west, the Shogunate forces collapsed and fled to Osaka down the Yodo-gawa River. During the battle <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Tadasaburo SASAKI.html">Tadasaburo SASAKI</a>, the head of the Kyoto-Mimawarigumi (a special police force), was badly wounded (and later died); <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Susumu YAMAZAKI.html">Susumu YAMAZAKI</a>, an internal affairs officer and secret agent of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shinsengumi.html">Shinsengumi</a>, was badly wounded (and later died off the coast of Kishu Bay); and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Kanichiro YOSHIMURA.html">Kanichiro YOSHIMURA</a>, who had the same position as Yamazaki, went missing (and later killed himself in the Nanbu domain residence in Osaka). The amount of damage sustained by each of the opposing forces is said to be unknown. </p>
<p>The former Shogunate forces requested the lord of the Yodo domain (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Fushimi Ward.html">Fushimi Ward</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>), <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Masakuni INABA.html">Masakuni INABA</a> (a close aide to Yoshinobu and an incumbent senior councilor) to open Yodo Castle to them so they could regroup their forces. The Yodo domain, however, did not want to fight the new government's forces, and secured the castle gate, refusing the former Shogunate forces entry to the castle. As a result, the former Shogunate forces of 15,000 soldiers were defeated by the new government's forces of only 5,000 soldiers early in the battle. The battle continued on the following day (January 28), and on January 29, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Meiji.html">Emperor Meiji</a> granted the Imperial standard to Imperial Prince Komatsunomiya Akihito (some believe <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Tomomi IWAKURA.html">Tomomi IWAKURA</a> forged it); consequently, the new government's forces became the Imperial forces. For this reason, several domains such as the opportunistic Tottori domain and the soldiers of the Tsu domain (the spearhead of the former Shogunate forces) in Yamazaki sided with the new government's forces. This definitely placed the former Shogunate forces on a losing course. </p>
<p>Yoshinobu, who is said to have not actively supported starting a war, stayed at Osaka Castle when the defeat of the former Shogunate forces was imminent and he was informed of the issuing of the punitive order against him on February 7; that night Yoshinobu secretly escaped from the castle and retreated to Edo on the Shogunate warship Kaiyo Maru on February 8, which had been anchored at Osaka Bay, along with a few of his close aides as well as Katsukiyo ITAKURA (a senior councilor), Tadato SAKAI (a senior councilor), <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Katamori MATSUDAIRA.html">Katamori MATSUDAIRA</a> (the lord of the Aizu domain) and Sadaki MATSUDAIRA (the lord of the Kuwana domain). The former Shogunate forces were completely defeated due to the retreat of the Commander in Chief of the former Tokugawa Shogunate, Yoshinobu TOKUGAWA, the strong artillery of the new government's forces, and the abandonment of the former Shogunate forces by an increasing number of domains due to the superiority of the new government's forces. Afterwards, the staging of the Boshin War led to the Ueno War in the urban area of Edo, the Hokuetsu War in the Hokuriku and Tohoku regions, the Aizu War, and then the Hakodate War. <h3>Historic sites</h3>

It is located near the parking lot of the Kyoto Race Course. 
<br/>The monument for the burial and the memorial monument voluntarily created still remain, and the surface of the stone is inscribed as follows:<br/>
There is nothing more tragic than the battles at the end of the Tokugawa shogunate<br/>
The battles were waged between the Japanese people. The Shogunate forces and the Imperial forces each believed in themselves, and swore allegiance to their respective causes. Thus, their destiny led them to become either members of the Imperial forces or the Shogunate forces, and to die for the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> code. 100 hundred years have since passed. So we build this memorial monument on this site for the proud people who unfortunately passed away with the stigma of being enemies of the Imperial Court. 
<br/>May the souls of the deceased rest in peace<br/>
Katsugoro NAKAMURA, 1969<br/>
