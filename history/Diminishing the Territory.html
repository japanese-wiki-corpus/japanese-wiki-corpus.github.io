<h1>Diminishing the Territory (減封)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Diminishing the territory was a type of punishment imposed on samurai including daimyo (Japanese feudal lord) and hatamoto (direct vassal of the shogun) during the Edo period, that deprived samurai of their ranks, and partially diminished their territories, castles, and residences. Also, there were measures to divide their territories to succeed ("bunpo"), and to confiscate their territories ("kaieki"). A description of the punishment of diminishing territory during the Edo Period follows. </p>
