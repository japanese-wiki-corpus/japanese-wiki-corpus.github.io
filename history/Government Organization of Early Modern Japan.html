On January 3, 1868, three offices of Sosai, Gijo and Sanyo (all of them, roughly concilors) were established, abolishing the positions of Sessho <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kampaku.html">Kampaku</a> (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Regent.html">regent</a> and chief adviser to the Emperor), <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Seii Taishogun.html">Seii Taishogun</a> (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>, literally meaning, "great general who subdues the barbarians"), <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Nairan.html">Nairan</a> (private inspection), Chokumon (questions by Emperor), Kokujigakari (officials in charge of state affairs), Giso (a position conveying what the congress decides to Emperor), Buke Tenso (a position conveying messages between Emperor and the shogunate), Shugoshiki (military governor) and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shoshidai.html">Shoshidai</a> (the shogunate's military governor stationed in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>). </p>
<p>On February 10, 1868, the structure of the three offices was regulated and organized. </p>

<p>On August 15, 1869, the whole system of job grades and court ranks was revised. The traditional Momono-tsukasa (many officials) and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Zuryo (The Head of The Provincial Governors).html">Zuryo</a> (provincial governors) were totally abolished and two officials and six ministries were newly established. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Jushii.html">Jushii</a> (Junior Fourth Rank) and lower ranks had been divided into two ("higher" and "lower") but such division was abolished, and court ranks were reorganized into eighteen stages from <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shoichii.html">Shoichii</a> (Senior First Rank) to Shosoi (Later Shokui (Senior Ninth Rank) was newly created and the number of court ranks increased to twenty on September 25, 1869). </p>

The traditional Kanisoto Sei (the ranks of the bureaucracy system of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Ritsuryo.html">ritsuryo</a> system) was abolished and new official ranks (fifteen in total) were created. </p>
