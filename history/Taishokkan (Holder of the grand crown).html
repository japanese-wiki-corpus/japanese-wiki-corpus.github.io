<h1>Taishokkan (Holder of the grand crown) (大織冠)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Taishokkan (Daishikikan) was the highest rank which was established in the Taika Reforms in 647 (enforced in 648) by revising the Kan I junikai (twelve grades of cap rank), and which was newly established in the Kan I jusankai (thirteen grades of cap rank) of the cap rank and official rank system. It was also inherited to the Kan I jukyukai (nineteen grades of cap rank) revised in 649 and the Kan I nijurokkai (twenty-six grades of cap rank) in 664. </p>
<p>Taishokkan was bestowed to only meritorious vassals who accomplished great achievements to the Imperial Court since it was placed at a higher cap rank than Murasaki no koburi; Murasaki no koburi had been worn by Oomi (a highest officer in national politics of the Yamato dynasty) and had not been included in the Kan I junikai, but was then demoted to the fifth or sixth from the top. </p>
<p>It was abolished when the Kan I yonjuhakkai (forty-eight grades of cap rank) was established in 685. </p>
<p>It was also used as another name of FUJIWARA no Kamatari. It was because he received Taishoku no kani (First Cap Rank) on December 6, 669. Only Kamatari received Taishokkan among retainers on the record. In addition, there was only one record that shokkan was donated to YO Hosho, a prince of Paekche, in 662. </p>
