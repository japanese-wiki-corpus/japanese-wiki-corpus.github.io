<h1>Kanjosho (勘定所)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kanjosho is the name of an office or a governing organization established for finance and civil administration in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Edo bakufu.html">Edo bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>), in each domain and at each <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Hatamoto (direct retainers of shogun).html">hatamoto</a> (direct retainers of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Edo bakufu.html">Edo bakufu</a>). It is often headed by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Kanjo.html">kanjo</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Bugyo.html">bugyo</a> (commissioner of finance). Each bugyosho had different official duties, organization and year of foundation. </p>
<p>Its general duties are:<br/>
</p>
<p>Those by the local governor, who administrates agricultural policies of the directly controlled area. </p>
<p>-Collection of land taxes called <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Nengu (Land Tax).html">nengu</a>, etc. </p>
<p>Those by the magistrate of the district, who is in charge of the operations covering the directly controlled area and the territory given by the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> or feudal lord as salaries. </p>
<p>-Transmission of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> orders, law and order, flood control, development of new fields, etc. </p>
<p>As stated above, they are roughly classified into two. In the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Edo bakufu.html">Edo bakufu</a>, the two types of operations are integrated into the kanjosho, but many of the domains have two independent organizations. </p>
