<p>Kansenji, also called "Benkankudashibumi," are oral decrees (called <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kuzen.html">Kuzen</a>) of a high-ranking court noble (called <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shokei (court novels who work at the Imperial Court in high ranking posts).html">Shokei</a>) of a Dajokan that officials of the Dajokan (called <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Benkan (Collective name of posts in Daijokan).html">benkan</a>) during the Heian period sent to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Ritsuryo.html">Ritsuryo</a> koku and temples. Kansenji served Kanpu and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Kancho.html">Kancho</a>. </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>While official documents to be issued by Daijokan are edited by Gekikyoku, kansenji is edited and issued by benkankyoku which is a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Point (Sentoki).html">point</a> of contact with different provinces and temples. Therefore, kansenji was not sealed with the official stamp of daijokan that a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shonagon (Post in Daijokan).html">shonagon</a>, who administered the gekikyoku, had in his hand. 
<br/>It is now accepted that the 'kan' in the word 'kansenji' means '<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Benkan (Collective name of posts in Daijokan).html">benkan</a>' and not 'daijokan.'<br/>
Benkankyoku had two benkans according to its duties: <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Benkan (Collective name of posts in Daijokan).html">benkan</a> of the right (called ubenkan) and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Benkan (Collective name of posts in Daijokan).html">benkan</a> of the left (called sabenkan), but kansenji were issued irrespective of these duties, that is, kansenji on happy events (ordinary administrative events) were issued by sabenkan, whereas kansenji on unhappy events (additional arrests) are issued by ubenkan, and since edicts issued by the former (called 'sabenkan gebun') are predominantly numerous, some claim that only this type of documents are kansenji. Usually, a draft of an imperial edict is orally transmitted by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kurodo (Chamberlain).html">kurodo</a> to jokyo, then jokyo commands the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Benkan (Collective name of posts in Daijokan).html">benkan</a> to edit the kansenji and a recorder, who is an officer subject to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Benkan (Collective name of posts in Daijokan).html">benkan</a>, (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Ritsuryo.html">ritsuryo</a> system) makes the actual text. </p>
<p>Text is given in shinsho-tai style of classical Chinese, is opened by an expression '<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Sakan (Kokushi).html">sakan</a> kudasu' ('ukan kudasu' if it is an edict made by the ubenkan), then is followed by an address (only names of province and temple are noted), then by a header (a summary of the text) in the next line and finally by the text. 
<br/>The text is ended by a closing term such as '依宣行之' or '官符追下.'<br/>
A date was given in a line next to the line of the text-closing term and, under this date, the signature and stamp of the recorder who made this edict was given and those of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Benkan (Collective name of posts in Daijokan).html">benkan</a> who issued this edict is given in the ojo (over the last line, next to the line containing the date and the stamp of recorder). All information about title, concurrent posts etc. is omitted. A signature placed by uchuben or sashoben, a person being most likely to issue an edict, was just 'chuben' or 'shoben' (there have been no previous cases in which sadaiben or ubenkan placed such a simple signature). </p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Daijokanpu.html">daijokanpu</a> or dajokancho was not fit for emergencies because <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shonagon (Post in Daijokan).html">shonagon</a> and geki, who were not directly in charge of their issuance, were implicated, because the imperial stamp was needed for their issuance and because the procedures were complicated and often necessitated ceremonious events: exchange of documents, stamping etc. This is the reason why they have been replaced by kansenji, an edict of which issuance procedures were simplified. Although, kansenji was often closed by a text-closing term '官符追下' even if an official document was not issued later, since kansenji was based on the premise that an official kanpu or <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Kancho.html">kancho</a> were later issued. There were also the cases in which non-urgent orders and non-imperative documents were issued as kansenji. </p>
<p>From the early <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period, kansenji was gradually limited to announcements of the dates of Buddhists or Shintoist rites to temples or shrines and dispatch of Emperor's messengers, because such orders were more and more sent as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Inzen (a decree from the retired Emperor).html">inzen</a> issued by a retired emperor or as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Rinji (the Emperors command).html">rinji</a>, a more simplified edict. </p>
