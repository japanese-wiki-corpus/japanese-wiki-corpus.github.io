<h1>Four Fujiwara Brothers (藤原四兄弟)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Fujiwara shi kyodai/Fujiwara yon kyodai (Four Fujiwara Brothers) was the historical term that refers to the four sons of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/FUJIWARA no Fuhito.html">FUJIWARA no Fuhito</a> who held the reins during the Tenpyo era (729-748) in the early Nara period. They were also called as Fujiwara shishi/Fujiwara yonshi (Four Fujiwara Brothers). </p>
<p><h3>Four Fujiwara Brothers</h3>
</p>
<p><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/FUJIWARA no Muchimaro.html">FUJIWARA no Muchimaro</a>, 680 - 737 (the founder of the Southern House of the Fujiwara clan)<br/>
</p>

</p>
<p><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/FUJIWARA no Maro.html">FUJIWARA no Maro</a>, 695 - 737 (the founder the Western House of the Fujiwara clan)<br/>
</p>
<p>Muchimaro, Fusasaki, and Umakai were maternal half-brothers while Maro was a paternal half-brother. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/FUJIWARA no Miyako.html">FUJIWARA no Miyako</a>, the mother of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Shomu.html">Emperor Shomu</a>, and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Empress Komyo.html">Empress Komyo</a>, the wife of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Shomu.html">Emperor Shomu</a>, were paternal half-sisters. <h3>Four Fujiwara brothers government</h3>
</p>
<p>After the death of Fuhito who was involved with the compilation of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Ritsuryo.html">Ritsuryo</a> codes, the relocation of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Heijo-kyo.html">Heijo-kyo</a> capital and so on, four brothers fought for the political power with <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Prince Nagaya.html">Prince Nagaya</a> through the reigns of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Empress Gensho.html">Empress Gensho</a> to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Shomu.html">Emperor Shomu</a>. After defeating the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Prince Nagaya.html">Prince Nagaya</a> in the Conspiracy of Nagayao, along with Muchimaro (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Dainagon (chief councilor of state).html">Dainagon</a> [chief councilor of state]) and Fusasaki (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Sangi.html">Sangi</a> [councilor]) who had already become a court noble, Umakai and Maro also became <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Sangi.html">sangi</a>, and four brothers occupied the power among the nine court nobles and they played a political role in the Imperial Court from 729 to 737. 
<br/>It is called 'Four Fujiwara brothers government.'<br/>
</p>
<p>In the 'Four Fujiwara brothers government' era, the finance under the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Ritsuryo.html">Ritsuryo</a> codes was established, in 734, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shozei (the rice tax stored in provincial offices warehouse).html">shozei</a> (the rice tax stored in provincial offices warehouse) with the mixed Kanto (rice gathered as rice field tax and stored in various provinces) was enacted, and in 736, land taxes on <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Koden.html">Koden</a> (field administered directly by a ruler) paying to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> were begun. They deployed a Sokan (a military authority) in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and Kinai region (provinces surrounding <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and Nara), a Chinbushi (a temporary government post), later a Setsudoshi (a military governor), in every route in areas west of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Heijo-kyo.html">Heijo-kyo</a> (the ancient capital of Japan in current Nara) to improve the maintenance of security. As the external policies, they dispatched a Kenshiragi-shi (Japanese envoy to Shilla) and conducted expeditions to Tohoku region. </p>
<p>Four brothers died one after another due to the epidemic of smallpox that occurred in 737, which brought to an end of the four Fujiwara brothers government.
