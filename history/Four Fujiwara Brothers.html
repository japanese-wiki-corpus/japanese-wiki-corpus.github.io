</p>
<p>After the death of Fuhito who was involved with the compilation of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ritsuryo.html">Ritsuryo</a> codes, the relocation of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Heijo-kyo.html">Heijo-kyo</a> capital and so on, four brothers fought for the political power with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Prince Nagaya.html">Prince Nagaya</a> through the reigns of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Empress Gensho.html">Empress Gensho</a> to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Shomu.html">Emperor Shomu</a>. After defeating the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Prince Nagaya.html">Prince Nagaya</a> in the Conspiracy of Nagayao, along with Muchimaro (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Dainagon (chief councilor of state).html">Dainagon</a> [chief councilor of state]) and Fusasaki (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Sangi.html">Sangi</a> [councilor]) who had already become a court noble, Umakai and Maro also became <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Sangi.html">sangi</a>, and four brothers occupied the power among the nine court nobles and they played a political role in the Imperial Court from 729 to 737. 
<br/>It is called 'Four Fujiwara brothers government.'<br/>
</p>
<p>In the 'Four Fujiwara brothers government' era, the finance under the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ritsuryo.html">Ritsuryo</a> codes was established, in 734, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shozei (the rice tax stored in provincial offices warehouse).html">shozei</a> (the rice tax stored in provincial offices warehouse) with the mixed Kanto (rice gathered as rice field tax and stored in various provinces) was enacted, and in 736, land taxes on <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Koden.html">Koden</a> (field administered directly by a ruler) paying to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> were begun. They deployed a Sokan (a military authority) in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and Kinai region (provinces surrounding <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and Nara), a Chinbushi (a temporary government post), later a Setsudoshi (a military governor), in every route in areas west of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Heijo-kyo.html">Heijo-kyo</a> (the ancient capital of Japan in current Nara) to improve the maintenance of security. As the external policies, they dispatched a Kenshiragi-shi (Japanese envoy to Shilla) and conducted expeditions to Tohoku region. </p>
<p>Four brothers died one after another due to the epidemic of smallpox that occurred in 737, which brought to an end of the four Fujiwara brothers government. Because the children of four brothers were young, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/TACHIBANA no Moroe.html">TACHIBANA no Moroe</a> (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Prince Kazuraki.html">Prince Kazuraki</a>), who was a maternal half-brother of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Empress Komyo.html">Empress Komyo</a> (a daughter of Fuhito) and descended to subject status, was responsible for the government as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Udaijin (Minister of the Right).html">Udaijin</a> (minister of the right). <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Hirotsugu.html">FUJIWARA no Hirotsugu</a>, the son of Umakai was subdued in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Rebellion of FUJIWARA no Hirotsugu.html">Rebellion of FUJIWARA no Hirotsugu</a> in 740; thereafter a period of absence of high rank officials from Fujiwara clan continued for a certain time until <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Toyonari.html">FUJIWARA no Toyonari</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Nakamaro.html">FUJIWARA no Nakamaro</a>, the sons of Muchimaro, gained power in the Emperor Koken's era. </p>
<p>Each lineage of descendants of four Fujiwara brothers was called '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/family/Fujiwara Nanke (Fujiwara Nan Family).html">Fujiwara Nanke</a>' (the Southern House of the Fujiwara clan), 'FUJIWARA Hokke' (the Northern House of the Fujiwara clan), '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Fujiwara Shikike (the Ceremonial House of the Fujiwara clan).html">Fujiwara Shikike</a>' (the Ceremonial House of the Fujiwara clan), and '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Fujiwara Kyoke (the Capital House of the Fujiwara clan).html">Fujiwara Kyoke</a>' (the Western House of the Fujiwara clan); although they went through the rise and fall, they left a major mark on later politics, learning, and culture.
