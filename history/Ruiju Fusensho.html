<h1>Ruiju Fusensho (類聚符宣抄)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Ruiju fusensho is a collection of official documents where <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Daijokanpu.html">Daijokanpu</a> (official documents issued by Daijokan, Grand Council of State), imperial decrees and gebumi (reports to upper-class persons) from 737 to 1093 were classified and compiled. It is also called "Sajosho." </p>
<p>Its oldest manuscript (now kept in the Imperial Household Archives) copied in 1121 to 1122, towards the end of the Heian period, was kept secretly by the Ozuki clan for a long time, with the latest document included there concerned with an imperial decree issued on 23 February, 1093, and therefore, it has been considered that the document was completed between 1093 and 1121. </p>
<p>However, a new theory was proposed saying that MINAMOTO no Tsuneyori (Uda-Genji (Minamoto clan)), a governmental official responsible for practical works, compiled it for necessities for carrying out his official duties. According to this theory, it is said that the compilation of this book was stopped before its completion, because Tsuneyori died in 1039. However, the latest document included there is an imperial decree issued in 1093, as described before, contradicting the theory that its compilation ended in 1039. On this <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Point (Sentoki).html">point</a>, it is considered that, because all of the documents between 1039 and 1093 are concerned with nyoingo (a title of respect given to close female relatives of the Emperor or a woman of comparable standing), they were augmented later in 1121 when the latest manuscript was completed. </p>
<p>This book is recorded in vol. 27 of Shintei Zoho <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Kokushi Taikei (Compilation of historical and juridical texts from the fourteenth century).html">Kokushi Taikei</a> (Newly revised and enlarged survey of Japanese history) (published by Yoshikawa Kobunkan Inc.). </p>
