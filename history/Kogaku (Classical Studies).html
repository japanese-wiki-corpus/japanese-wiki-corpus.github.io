<p>Kogaku (also referred to as Kokaku, and Seigaku) was a learning revived by Soko YAMAGA, and a group of Confucianism. It is a general term for Seigaku, Kogigaku (study of ancient principles) and Kobunjigaku (study of ancient rhetoric school). Kogaku scholars studied directly and empirically those Buddhist scriptures such as Rongo (Analects of Confucius), without relying on the interpretations of later generations.
