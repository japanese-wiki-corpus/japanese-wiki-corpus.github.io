<h1>Jige Kaden (地下家伝)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The Jige Kaden, a work of history written during the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Tenpo.html">Tenpo</a> era in the late Edo period, is a collection of the genealogical records of families of Jigenin (low-ranking court officials who were not allowed into the Emperor's living quarters in the imperial palace, usually ranked at the sixth rank or lower except for <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Kurodo (Chamberlain).html">Kurodo</a>). The editor was <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Kagefumi MIKAMI.html">Kagefumi MIKAMI</a>, a member of the Hokumen warriors (guards of the north side of the Imperial palace). </p>
<p>Background of the Work's Composition<br/>
By the period Kagefumi lived in, several hundred years had already passed since the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Ritsuryo.html">Ritsuryo</a> system had become nothing but a name and the noble families of the court had been divided by status into the Tosho-ke (the lineage of court nobles occupying relatively high ranks) and the Jige-ke. The high-ranking Tosho-ke families had detailed records of their origins, the dates of birth and death of their successive heads, and the history of their investiture. But among the Jige-ke, who were more like actual administrative officers, few families kept such grand genealogies. In addition, there were many Jige-ke families who had originally been outside the circles of power, but were promoted out of recognition for their contributions and newly given the status of Jige as new families. This might be the reason that most of the Jige-ke families in those days were unclear about their origins and histories. </p>
<p>Bemoaning this fact, Kagefumi started an independent survey of the various Jige-ke families' lineages. His method of collecting the necessary sources is unknown. It is assumed that possibly, in response to his request, the Jige-families offered their family trees and the kuzenan (official announcements of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Appointment (Ninkan).html">appointment</a>) that had been handed down from generation to generation. Based on such materials collected in this way, Kagefumi started writing in October 1842. After a year and a half, the first edition was completed on June 16, 1844. </p>
<p>Publication by Atsuo MASAMUNE<br/>
After the first edition was published, the Jige Kaden was revised and supplemented several times, and the last revision was performed during the Ansei era. Although not many, some manuscripts were made. However, they were not printed but copied by hand using a brush, and the more the book was copied, the more clerical errors, omissions, and errors in the structure of volumes were produced. </p>
<p>In 1938, Atsuo MASAMUNE, a scholar of Japanese literature, edited the manuscripts surviving at the time and published them. Still, among the several manuscripts he used for reference, there were some differences in the characters and the structure of volumes. This was the reason for Masamune labeling the 31st volume of the Jige Kaden as missing. It also has the defect that because it was not revised after the Ansei era, it cannot identify the heads during the period from the last revision to the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Meiji Restoration (Meiji-ishin).html">Meiji Restoration</a>, when the status of Jige was discontinued. However, neither the original text written by Kagefumi himself nor any manuscript essentially identical to it has been found yet. Besides, now that Masamune himself has already passed away, another edition of the Jige Kaden more accurate than Masamune's edition is unlikely to be published. </p>
<p>And yet there is nothing else that has surveyed the genealogical record of the Jige-ke families so carefully or in such detail. For this reason, now the Jige Kaden is an indispensable historical source for the study and research of Jige-ke families. </p>
<p>Contents<br/>
The Jige Kaden has 33 volumes in total, divided according to categories such as the offices they held, and the differences between Sekke (families of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Regent.html">regent</a> line), <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Miyake.html">Miyake</a> (families allowed to have the status of the Imperial family) and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Monzeki (Monseki).html">Monzeki</a> (families from temples of high rank where members of imperial family and nobility had entered the priesthood). It records, in as much detail as possible, such things as the names of the successive heads of Jige-ke families, the names of their fathers and mothers, the dates of their birth and death, and the history of their investitures and appointments to office.
