<p></p>
<p>The Shoen-Koryo system was a multilayered land governance structure which was grounded in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> (manors) and lands under the control of the koryo (feudal government) in medieval times in Japan. The concept for the Shoen-Koryo system was proposed by the historian, Yoshihiko AMINO. The Shoen-Koryo system was established in the mid to late 11th century and continued through until the early 12th century, so it was developed through the period of the Cloister government, and peaked around the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period. The system, however, was encroached on by Jito (lords of the manors) in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period and by Shugo Daimyos (provincial constables) in the Muromachi period, and thus gradually dismantled in accordance with the rise of samurais and almost became a mere formality by the time of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Sengoku Period (period of warring states) (Japan).html">Sengoku Period</a> (Period of Warring States) (Japan). It completely disappeared as Taiko <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kenchi.html">kenchi</a> (cadastral surveys conducted by Hideyoshi) was carried out. </p>
<p>Note that the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> and lands under the control of the koryo described here mean kishinchi-kei-shoen and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kokugaryo.html">Kokugaryo</a> (provincial lands), which became the base of the Shoen-Koryo system. </p>
<p><h3>Enactment</h3>
</p>
<p>After the mid Heian Period, new rice fields were actively developed by Kaihatsu-ryoshu. Although <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kokuga (provincial government office compounds).html">Kokuga</a> (provincial offices) allowed them to have their own private lands, the right was very fragile. Accordingly, they donated the lands to the Juryoso (career provincial official class) as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a>. The Juryoso (career provincial official class) assigned the Tato (cultivators) (=Kaihatsu-ryoshu) to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shokan.html">Shokan</a> (a general term for a variety of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> (manor) officials responsible for the management and assignment of duties, tax collection, and protection of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a>) and collected certain tax revenues from the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shokan.html">Shokan</a> in exchange for recognizing their effective authorities for the lands. The Juryoso who obtained <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> in this way were called <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Ryoke.html">Ryoke</a> (main proprietors). The <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Ryoke.html">Ryoke</a> gradually became rivals of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kokushi.html">Kokushi</a> (provincial governors) in the same class, who were governing the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kokuga (provincial government office compounds).html">kokuga</a> lands. Hence, they donated their own lands to the Kenmonso (gateway-of-power class) and paid certain tax revenues to have them protect the lands. The Kenmonso who collected <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> were called <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Honke.html">Honke</a> (protectors). </p>
<p>Coincidentally, with the demise of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Ritsuryo.html">Ritsuryo</a> system (the political system based on the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Ritsuryo.html">ritsuryo</a> codes), the high-level aristocrats lost their eagerness for politics completely, and accordingly, local politics were entrusted to the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kokushi.html">Kokushi</a>. In competition with the ever-increasing <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a>, the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kokushi.html">Kokushi</a> assigned <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">Daimyo</a> tato (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> cultivators) to Zaicho <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Kanjin.html">kanjin</a> (resident public officials) and deployed them on hand; moreover, they had Soji, Goji, and Hoji (all of which were local government officials under the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Ritsuryo.html">ritsuryo</a> system) appointed as local government officials. Soji, Goji, and Hoji were supposed to pay a certain amount of tax revenues to each of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kokushi.html">Kokushi</a> and the imperial court. After that, the imperial court, who were no longer able to pay the salaries of the high-level aristocrats due to decreased tax revenues because of the growing number of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a>, gave territories as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Chigyo.html">Chigyo</a> koku (proprietary provinces), as well as the patronage of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kokushi.html">Kokushi</a> and tax revenues regarding the province, to the high-level aristocrats. In the same manner, the Ingu <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bunkoku.html">bunkoku</a> sei (provincial allotment system) was applied to the high-level aristocrats, it formed a structure in which the high-level aristocrats were connected as Kenmonso, the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kokushi.html">Kokushi</a> as Juryoso, and the Soji, Goji, and Hoji as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">Daimyo</a> tato, resulting in as system which was little different from the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shoen.html">Shoen</a> system. </p>
<p>This multilayered governance structure was also called the "<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shiki (a rank in government offices under ritsuryo system).html">Shiki</a> system" and each job title and authority was referred as "XXX <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shiki (a rank in government offices under ritsuryo system).html">shiki</a>." 
<br/>(e.g. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Ryoke.html">Ryoke</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shiki (a rank in government offices under ritsuryo system).html">shiki</a>, Soji <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shiki (a rank in government offices under ritsuryo system).html">shiki</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Goshi (country samurai).html">Goshi</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shiki (a rank in government offices under ritsuryo system).html">shiki</a>, etc.)<br/>
</p>
<p>Transition and decline<br/>
As disputes over land increased among the Ryoshu (feudal lords) of the provinces, they armed themselves and eventually became samurais. With the establishment of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>), samurais, especially in the Kanto region, became <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Gokenin.html">Gokenin</a> (lower-ranking vassals in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> and Edo periods) who entered into the service of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>. As benefits of the position, they were designated as Jito and the authority of their lands was guaranteed. Note that it does not mean that they took up a completely new <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shiki (a rank in government offices under ritsuryo system).html">Shiki</a> called Jito; Jito was simply a position, among <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shokan.html">Shokan</a>, Goji and Hoji, which had a master-subordinate relationship with the feudal government. They, of course, did not have a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shiki (a rank in government offices under ritsuryo system).html">Shiki</a> which was higher than <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shokan.html">Shokan</a>, Goji or Hoji. </p>
<p>The feudal government had the authority to assign Jito in Kanto goseibaichi (provinces, manors and provincial lands where the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> families of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> possess the power to appoint/dismiss Jito). In other words, the Kanto shinshiryo (manors and provincial lands where the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> has the right to appoint/dismiss Jito) and Kanto gokunyuchi (manors and provincial lands where the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> has the right to recommend Jito) had <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shoen-ryoshu (lord of a manor).html">Shoen-ryoshu</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kokushi.html">Kokushi</a> who were different from those of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> and had no patronage of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shokan.html">Shokan</a>, Goji, or Hoji. It is notable that the provincial constables had Zaicho <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Kanjin.html">kanjin</a> (local district officials) prepare Ota bumi (land ledgers) from the time of Yoritomo. Jito's acts beyond their authorities, including arrears in taxes and illegal use of the people in the province, gave rise to disputes with the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shoen-ryoshu (lord of a manor).html">Shoen-ryoshu</a> and the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kokushi.html">Kokushi</a>. To resolve this issue, the Jito uke (proprietor's annual tax) and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shitaji chubun.html">Shitaji chubun</a> (physical division of land) were adopted. In this way, the Jito gradually strengthened their control of the territories. </p>
<p>From the start of the Muromachi period, provincial constables increased their power based on the background of the establishment of the Muromachi <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>. With the aim of establishing the Shugo-ryogokusei, they relegated Jito and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kokujin.html">Kokujin</a>, including Zaicho-kanjin of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period, to their subordinates and took over the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kokuga (provincial government office compounds).html">Kokuga</a> and their lands. Around the same time, provincial constables also encroached on other rights, including the power of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shoen-ryoshu (lord of a manor).html">Shoen-ryoshu</a> using the systems of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Hanzei (Half Payment of Taxes).html">Hanzei</a> and Shugo-uke, and from the start of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Sengoku Period (period of warring states) (Japan).html">Sengoku Period</a> (Period of Warring States) (Japan), <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">Daimyo</a> (Japanese territorial lords) in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Sengoku Period (period of warring states) (Japan).html">Sengoku Period</a> who turned into <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">Daimyo</a> further promoted Ichien <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Chigyo.html">chigyo</a> (complete proprietorship) of the lands. </p>
<p>After that, based on the Taiko <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kenchi.html">kenchi</a>, only new cultivator's rights became effective, resulting in the disappearance of the old multilayered land governance structure in both reality and in name. </p>
