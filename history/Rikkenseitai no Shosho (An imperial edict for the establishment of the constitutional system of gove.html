<p>In March of the same year, after Kido and Itagaki returned to the positions of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Sangi.html">Sangi</a> (councillors), they drew up a political reform plan together with Okubo and Ito based on the agreement in the Osaka conference, and then submitted the plan to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Sanetomi SANJO.html">Sanetomi SANJO</a>, the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daijo-daijin (Grand minister of state).html">Daijo-daijin</a> (the Grand Minister). Then, on April 14, a Monjo (written material), which was prepared based on the political reform plan, was announced as a Shosho by the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Meiji.html">Emperor Meiji</a>. That is the Rikkenseitai no Shosho. </p>
