<h1>Ina no Agata (猪名県)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Ina no Agata was one of the early form of the local bureaucratic system in ancient Japan (Agata), which was placed in Hokusetsu (northern Settsu Province, the area covering now Suita City through Amagasaki City) during the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kofun period (tumulus period).html">Kofun period</a> (tumulus period), the era of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yamato.html">Yamato</a> sovereignty. </p>
<p>Summary<br/>
Ina no Agata first appeared in the Japanese history book "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan).html">Nihonshoki</a>" (Chronicles of Japan), which is thought to have been completed during the Nara period. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan).html">Nihonshoki</a> says 'During the period of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Nintoku.html">Emperor Nintoku</a>, an army called "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Saekibe.html">Saekibe</a>" under <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yamato.html">Yamato</a> sovereignty, which was formed by Ina no Agata and belonged to Kinki region, presented a horse to the Emperor', and therefore it is thought that Ina no Agata had a close relationship with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yamato.html">Yamato</a> sovereignty from ancient times. It is also said that in this Agata there were Korean people who came to Japan from Korea, a country with an advanced civilization in those days. </p>
<p>Ina no Agata was controlled by 'the Inatsuhiko family', <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Gozoku (local ruling family).html">gozoku</a> (local ruling family) of Inatsuhiko Shrine was located in now Ishimaru, Mino City, Osaka Prefecture, and it is thought that a state had been established in now Hokusetsu area before the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Isshi Incident.html">Isshi Incident</a> (when <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Tenchi (Tenji).html">Emperor Tenchi</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Kamatari.html">FUJIWARA no Kamatari</a> destroyed the Soga family) and following 'Taika no Kaishin' (Great Reformation of the Taika Era) occurred in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Asuka (飛鳥 in Chinese characters, the name of present-day Asuka Village, Nara Prefecture).html">Asuka</a> period. Therefore, the Agata seems to have been established from the third through fifth centuries after the family became Agatanushi (District Chieftain) under <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yamato.html">Yamato</a> sovereignty. </p>
<p>Ina no Agatanushi (District Chieftain)<br/>
The Inatsuhiko family continued to control the area after Ina no Agata was established and descendants succeeded to Agatanushi. However, details about Agatanushi of Ina no Agata are unknown because no materials have been kept to today. </p>
