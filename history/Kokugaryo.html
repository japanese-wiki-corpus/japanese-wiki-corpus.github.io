<h1>Kokugaryo (国衙領)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kokugaryo is a historical term referring to koryo (an Imperial demesne) after around the mid-Heian period, differentiated from <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> (manor in medieval Japan). "<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Kokuga (provincial government office compounds).html">Kokuga</a>" means the administrative institutions in ryoseikoku (provinces). </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>Since around the 10th century, the tax system consisting of the ancient family registration system and handen shuju sei (a system of periodic reallocations of rice land) stipulated by the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Ritsuryo.html">Ritsuryo</a> system (a system of centralized government based on the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Ritsuryo.html">ritsuryo</a> code) had almost collapsed, gradually shifting into the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Kokushi.html">kokushi</a> ukeoi system, which made <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Zuryo (The Head of The Provincial Governors).html">Zuryo</a> (the head of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Kokushi.html">Kokushi</a> [provincial governors] who was sent to local provinces to administer) undertake tax collection in their provinces. Accordingly, koryo under the control of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Zuryo (The Head of The Provincial Governors).html">Zuryo</a> began to be treated like their private assets. To deal with tax delinquencies designated to the main temples and shrines, and the high-ranked aristocracy including Sekkan-ke (the families which produced regents), it became customary for <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Zuryo (The Head of The Provincial Governors).html">Zuryo</a> to give away to those tax recipients the rights to collect taxes from parts of koryo, as an attempt to avoid poor evaluation with <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Zuryo (The Head of The Provincial Governors).html">Zuryo</a> koka sadame, their job performance reviews. In this way, newly-established <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a>, namely, kokumen no sho (a <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> allowed exemption from rice tax or other tributes), had been vermicularly spreading within koryo, strangling the tax collection from koryo. </p>
<p>Especially in the 11th century, a number of fire disasters occurred in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Dairi (the Imperial palace).html">dairi</a> (the Imperial Palace), main temples and shrines, and it was difficult to levy extraordinary taxes for their reconstruction. Therefore, Manor Regulation Acts were frequently ordered to levy taxes (Ikkoku heikinyaku [taxes and labor uniformly imposed on <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> and kokugaryo in a province]) even on kokumen no sho, which was, after all, nothing more than an accomplished fact. These Manor Regulation Acts prohibited establishment of new <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> after the designated base year, while legalizing these extraordinary taxes that were to be imposed on kokumen no sho created prior to the base year. Before that, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> were simply agricultural lands scattered in koryo, of which the tax collection rights were exclusively possessed by the high-ranked aristocracy, main temples and shrines. However, following these orders, the government took measures to integrate <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> into one domain in an attempt to differentiate between koryo and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a>, facilitating the levy of Ikkoku heikinyaku. Thus, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> as a governing domain was established, where a <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shokan.html">shokan</a> (an officer governing <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> dispatched by the senior aristocracy and main temples and shrines) was delegated authority for local administration and tax collection for the nation. </p>
<p>Eventually, the old provincial system, administered by <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Zuryo (The Head of The Provincial Governors).html">zuryo</a> collectively including <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a>, was shifted into a new system, in which the control of land and people was roughly divided into two on the basis of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> (administered by <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shokan.html">shokan</a>) and koryo (administered by <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Zuryo (The Head of The Provincial Governors).html">zuryo</a>). Koryo under such a system were regarded as <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Kokuga (provincial government office compounds).html">kokuga</a> (provincial government offices) areas controlled by <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Zuryo (The Head of The Provincial Governors).html">zuryo</a>, and were called kokugaryo. Also, the historian Yoshihiko AMINO advocates a concept of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> koryo sei (The System of Public Lands and Private Estates), focusing on the fact that medieval Japanese society consisted of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> and koryo. </p>
<p>After the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>) was established, kokugaryo was gradually placed under the control of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a> (provincial constable) and jito (manager and lord of the manor), but still remained in the Muromachi period. Afterwards, it was effectively dismantled by taiko <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Kenchi.html">kenchi</a> (the cadastral surveys conducted by Hideyoshi). </p>
