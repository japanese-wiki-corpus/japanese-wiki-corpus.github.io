He made his name during the Eastern Expedition of the Emperor Jinmu, and he was appointed as the Yamato no Kuni no Miyatsuko for the first time in 658 B.C. <h3>Clan</h3>
</p>
<p>The clan was Yamato. As the Kanji for the name of the country was changed, the Kanji for the name of the clan was also changed (大倭, 大養徳, 大和 and so on [all of them were called 'Yamato']). Although his surname was Atai, Yamato no Tatsumaro's surname became Muraji in 681, the surname of the entire clan became Muraji in 683 and became Imiki in 685, and Yamato no Nagaoka and Mizumori were promoted to Sukune in the Nara period. </p>
<p>It should be noted that Kazuuji descended from Muryeong-wang, King of Baekje, therefore it was a different lineage. <h3>Home Base</h3>

<p>Yamato clan was located in Yamato Village, Shiki no Shimo no Kori County, Yamato Province. The current location is in Tenri City, Nara Prefecture. It is said that the Yamato clan ruled over Shiki and Tochi regions (the eastern part of Nara Basin) in the sixth and seventh century. <h3>Ujigami (a guardian god or spirit of a particular place in the Shinto religion)</h3>
