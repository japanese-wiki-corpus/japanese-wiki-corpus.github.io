<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>Hachimanyama-jo Castle was constructed on top of Mt. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Hachiman.html">Hachiman</a> (286 meters above sea level). Its castle town was formed by relocating the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Azuchi-jo Castle.html">Azuchi-jo Castle</a> town. Today, a part of the castle town was selected as '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Omi Hachiman City Preservation District for Groups of Historic Hachiman Buildings.html">Omi Hachiman City Preservation District for Groups of Historic Hachiman Buildings</a>', along with 'the precinct of Himure-hachimangu Shrine' and 'Hachiman-bori Moat' within the town. Drawing its water from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Lake Biwa.html">Lake Biwa</a>, Hachiman-bori Moat served not only as a moat during battles, but also as a waterway. Although there was a reclamation plan of the site to make a park and a parking lot in the 1970s, the castle was revived by citizens' movements including 'Yomigaeru Omihachiman no Kai' (Revitalize Omihachiman), 'Hachiman-bori wo Mamoru Kai' (Save Hachiman-bori Moat). The place now has become a famous tourist attraction and is often used as a backdrop for historical films. <h3>History</h3>
