<h1>Ochudo (落人)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Ochudo (or ochiudo) indicates persons who were defeated in a fight and escaped to and lived in a remote rural area or the person's descendants. When the term of ochudo is used with no additional explanation, it mostly means roto (retainers) of the Ise-Heishi (Taira clan) defeated in Jisho-Juei War and their descendants. </p>
<p>In not a few communities in mountainous areas, episodes related to ochudo of the Taira family have been handed down for generations and still remain. </p>
