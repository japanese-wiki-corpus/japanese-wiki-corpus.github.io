<h1>Ata (a unit of length used in ancient China and Japan) (咫)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Ata is a length unit used both in China and Japan. </p>
<p><h3>In China</h3>
</p>
<p>On the section of 'ata' (in pinyin, 'zhi') in Shuowen Jiezi (Analytical Dictionary of Chinese Characters), there exists a description that '8 sun ('cun' in pinyin; 1 sun is about 3.03 centimeters) of shu ('zhou' in pinyin) was equalized with 1 ata, and that 10 sun of shu was equalized with 1 <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shaku.html">shaku</a> ('chi' in pinyin; 1 <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shaku.html">shaku</a> is about 30.3 centimeters).'<br/>
Here, 'shu' meant the circumference of a circle, and 'ata' was its unit. The ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter is about 3.14, and provided that we round off the second decimal place and regard the ratio as 3.2, the circumference of a circle whose diameter is 1 <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shaku.html">shaku</a> becomes 3.2 <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shaku.html">shaku</a>, and in ancient China, this 3.2 <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shaku.html">shaku</a> was equalized with 4 ata. Therefore, 1 ata became 0.8 <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shaku.html">shaku</a>. </p>
<p>The Japanese <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Yata no Kagami.html">Yata no Kagami</a> (the eight-span mirror; one of the Imperial regalia) has 8 ata of circumference, in other words, the diameter of the mirror is 2 <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shaku.html">shaku</a> (23.04 centimeters). 1 <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shaku.html">shaku</a> in the Later Han Dynasty China was set at 23.04 centimeters (2 <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shaku.html">shaku</a>), so it means the mirror of about 46 centimeter in diameter, and by now 4 circular mirrors of this size have been excavated in China. <h3>In Japan</h3>
</p>
<p>Ata' is the nominalized word of the Japanese verb 'atsu,' which means 'measure with one's hand opened.'<br/>
Concretely, ata is the length from the tip of the middle finger to the tip of the thumb when they are opened, and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shaku.html">shaku</a> was originally defined to have the same length. In fact, the Chinese character 咫 (reads as ata) seen in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan).html">Nihonshoki</a> (Chronicles of Japan) was replaced with 尺 (reads as "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shaku.html">shaku</a>") in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kojiki (The Records of Ancient Matters).html">Kojiki</a> (The Records of Ancient Matters), which is exemplified by Yata no kagami (八咫鏡) replaced with 八尺鏡. In Japanese mythology, the length of 'yata' (八咫; 8 ata) is often seen such as, in Yata no kagami (八咫鏡) and in Yata garasu (八咫烏; the sacred crow with the span of 8 ata). </p>
<p>Ata' is also read as 'saka.'<br/>
Yasakani no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Magatama.html">magatama</a> (comma-shaped jewel) is written as 八尺瓊勾玉 in Chinese characters, and the second character 尺 was originally written as 'ata' (咫). </p>
