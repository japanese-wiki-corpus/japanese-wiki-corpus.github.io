<h1>Sanyojo (算用状)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Sanyojo (算用状 or 散用状) was the annual settlement of accounts for <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Nengu (Land Tax).html">nengu</a> (annual land tax) and kuji (miscellaneous tax) in each <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> (estate) exchanged between <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> ryoshu (the estate proprietary lord) and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shokan.html">shokan</a> (the estate manager) in the medieval <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> system. It was also referred to as Kechigecho. </p>
<p>Since sanyojo (Kechigecho) were documents regarding the settlement of accounts exchanged between the ryoshu and the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shokan.html">shokan</a> sides, they respectively drew up sanyojo (kechigecho) for individual purposes. </p>
<p>The sanyojo drawn up by the ryoshu (practically, ryoshu's general administrative body, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Mandokoro.html">mandokoro</a> - administrative board, and kumonjo - administrative office) was called shihai jo, gegyo jo, noge jo, and used for estimating revenue and expenditure for the year based on collection of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Nengu (Land Tax).html">nengu</a> from the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> and supporting the management (gegyo) policy. </p>
<p>On the other hand, sanyojo drawn up by the local <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shokan.html">shokan</a> side was called chushin jo, made for reporting the payment of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Nengu (Land Tax).html">nengu</a> for the year. The adjusted amount of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Nengu (Land Tax).html">nengu</a> to be sent to the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> ryoshu was calculated by subtracting the deduction (exemption), loss (damages caused by disaster), and arrearages (unpaid amount) for the year from the settled amount of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Nengu (Land Tax).html">nengu</a> first, further subtracting the local necessary expenses called geyo (unpolished rice), <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Shosei.html">shosei</a> (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Nengu (Land Tax).html">nengu</a> paid those other than <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> ryoshu), ruiyo (diversion), and adding the unpaid amount of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Nengu (Land Tax).html">nengu</a> collected the previous year. Since the farm production was unstable in those days, such annual adjustments were needed. </p>
