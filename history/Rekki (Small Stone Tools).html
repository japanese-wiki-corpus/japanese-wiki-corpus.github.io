<h1>Rekki (Small Stone Tools) (礫器)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Rekki refers to the stone tool made of bigger pebbles. Rekki was the primitive stone tool made by only crushing natural stones in early Paleolithic period, and it is observed that this was used in the stage of hominid. The central part (stone core) of the stone after the broken pieces were taken off was used as materials. Rekki was distinguished from the stone core stone tool in late Paleolithic period when broken pieces of stone were used for the production of stone tools. It was for all-purpose uses. </p>
