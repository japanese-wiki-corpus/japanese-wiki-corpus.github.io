<h1>Nijugozanmaie (二十五三昧会)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Nijugozanmaie was a Nenbutsu (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Buddhist invocation.html">Buddhist invocation</a>) association established in the Heian Period. </p>
<p>It was a Nenbutsu association established in 986 by 25 monks who gathered at Shuryogonin in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Enryaku-ji Temple.html">Enryaku-ji Temple</a>, Yokawa within Mt. Hie. The characteristic of this association was that it was a Nenbutsu association that wished for <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Gokuraku.html">gokuraku</a> ojo (peaceful death) and on the fifteenth of each month, 25 monks would gather to chant Nenbutsu and wish for <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Gokuraku.html">gokuraku</a> ojo. The 'Hotsugan bun' (vow) states that they agree to a bond of friendship, promise to help each other upon death and chant Nenbutsu. </p>
<p><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/YOSHISHIGE no Yasutane.html">YOSHISHIGE no Yasutane</a>, who was also the editor of "Nihon ojo gokurakuki" (Japanese records of birth into the Pure Land), drafted the 'Nijugozanmai kisho' which stated:<br/>
</p>
<p>On the fifteenth of each month, nenbutsu-zammai (mental absorption in the nenbutsu) should be chanted. </p>
<p>Komyo <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shingon.html">shingon</a> (Mantra of Light) should be chanted and Dosha kaji (incantation) conducted. </p>
<p>Members should strictly adhere to rules and non-adherents will be expelled and new members recruited instead. </p>
<p>An Ojo-in Temple celebrating Amida Nyorai will be established in a Bessho (remote religious facilities from main temple facilities) and sick members will be transferred there. </p>
<p>When a sick member is transferred to the Ojo-in Temple, a pair will stay with the sick member day and night, with one caring for the sick, while the other chants Nenbutsu. </p>
<p>The members' tomb will be called Kadaibyo and members will gather for a Nenbutsu meeting twice a year in spring and autumn. </p>
<p>Saiho Gokuraku Jodo (The West Pure Land) should be meditated on with mental absorption and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Gokuraku.html">gokuraku</a> ojo should be wished for. </p>
<p>Even if there are absent members, the members that are left must keep ties with deceased members by Shuzen (restoration). </p>
<p>These are the rules of the association. </p>
<p>The influence of "Kangaku-e" (assembly to encourage learning), an association established by Daigakuryo students and monks from Mt. Hie in 964, are seen in the establishment of Nijugozanmaie. However, although Kangaku-e resembled a Nenbutsu association, the group also had an aspect of a salon where "Hoke-kyo Sutra" (the Lotus Sutra) was chanted and poems were written. </p>
