<p></p>
<p>The Nakasendai War was a rebellion that occurred in July 1335 in which <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Tokiyuki HOJO.html">Tokiyuki HOJO</a>, a bereaved son of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Takatoki HOJO.html">Takatoki HOJO</a> (the 14th <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shikken (regent for the shogun).html">shikken</a> [shogunal <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Regent.html">regent</a>] of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> [Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>]), raised an army, with the support of Yorishige SUWA (the period of Northern and Southern Courts) of Shinano Province, with the aim to restore the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>. It is called the Nakasendai War based on the fact that <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Tokiyuki HOJO.html">Tokiyuki HOJO</a> temporarily occupied <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> during the period between the former administration (Hojo clan) and the subsequent administration (Ashikaga clan). </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>At the end of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period, Emperor Godaigo launched an anti-shogunate movement and senior vassals of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>, including <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Takauji ASHIKAGA.html">Takauji ASHIKAGA</a>, joined forces with the emperor. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> was occupied by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshisada NITTA.html">Yoshisada NITTA</a> in 1333 and the Hojo clan fell. After the fall of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>, the Kenmu Restoration, which was a direct rule by the emperor, started. In <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a>, the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> shogunfu (local institution of Kenmu government) was established, and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Imperial Prince Nariyoshi.html">Imperial Prince Nariyoshi</a>, a prince of Emperor Godaigo, and Naoyoshi ASHIKAGA, Takauji's younger brother, were appointed to its head and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shikken (regent for the shogun).html">shikken</a> respectively. However, the Kenmu government failed to gain the support of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> and the remnants of the Hojo clan repeatedly revolted against the government at various places. In 1335, a conspiracy became apparent in which court noble <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Kinmune SAIONJI.html">Kinmune SAIONJI</a> and the Hino clan, who had a relationship with the Hojo clan since they served as kanto <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Moshitsugi.html">moshitsugi</a> (court-appointed liaison with the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>) during the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period, sheltered Yasuie (Tokioki) HOJO, a younger brother of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Takatoki HOJO.html">Takatoki HOJO</a> who was in hiding in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, and attempted to overthrow the government in support of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Gofushimi.html">Emperor Gofushimi</a> of the Jimyoin line. Although Kinmune and others were killed after they failed to assassinate Emperor Godaigo, Yasuie escaped and appealed to the remnants of the Hojo clan in various places to raise an army. </p>
<p>Tokiyuki, who was in hiding in the Hojo clan's former territory, Shinano Province, raised an army with the support of hereditary vassals such as Yorishige SUWA and the Shigeno clan. In the Hokuriku region, Tokikane NAGOSHI, a member of the Hojo clan, raised an army in response to Tokiyuki. The Hoshina clan and the Shinomiya clan who sided with Tokiyuki attacked the forces of Sadamune OGASAWARA, military governor of Shinano Province, in the battle of Aonuma and moved from place to place along the Shinano-gawa River to fight. In the meantime, the Suwa clan and the Shigeno clan attacked the provincial government office of Shinano Province, forced the governor (Kiyohara-shi Mahito Bo) to commit suicide, entered <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Musashi Province.html">Musashi Province</a> and advanced toward <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a>. Tokiyuki's force defeated the army of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> shogunfu at various places including Onakagegahara, and defeated the army of Naoyoshi ASHIKAGA which came from <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> in order to intercept Tokiyuki's force. Naoyoshi escaped from <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> together with <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshiakira ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshiakira ASHIKAGA</a>, a very young son of Takauji, and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Imperial Prince Nariyoshi.html">Imperial Prince Nariyoshi</a>, a prince of Emperor Godaigo. In <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Imperial Prince Morinaga.html">Imperial Prince Morinaga</a>, a prince of Emperor Godaigo, was being confined after he was expelled from the Kenmu Government. When escaping from <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a>, Naoyoshi made his vassal Yoshihiro FUCHINOBE kill <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Imperial Prince Morinaga.html">Imperial Prince Morinaga</a> in secret. Tokiyuki's force defeated Naoyoshi at Tegoshigawara, Suruga Province and occupied <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> for a while. Naoyoshi stayed in Mikawa Province, sent a report on the war to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and sent back <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Imperial Prince Nariyoshi.html">Imperial Prince Nariyoshi</a>. </p>
<p>Being informed of Tokiyuki's rebellion, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Takauji ASHIKAGA.html">Takauji ASHIKAGA</a> requested Emperor Godaigo to permit him to suppress Tokiyuki and to confer on him the title of so-tsuibushi (job title which has the right of government, military affairs and police authority) and seii taishogun (literally, a general who subdues the barbarians) that were necessary for the establishment of military government. Emperor Godaigo, however, refused such requests. Takauji went to the front without obtaining the emperor's authorization, but Emperor Godaigo later conferred the title of seii taishogun on Takauji. After uniting with Naoyoshi, Takauji repeatedly defeated Tokiyuki's force at Hashimoto and Sayo no nakayama in Totomi Province, Sagami-gawa River in Sagami Province, and so on. Tokiyuki fled from <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> 20 days after he occupied it and Yorishige SUWA etc. committed suicide. </p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a>, Takauji gave <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Onsho.html">onsho</a> (reward grants), at his discretion, to those who followed him in the battle of suppressing the war, ignored the Kenmu Government's order to return to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and became alienated from the Kenmu government. </p>
<p>Tokiyuki was in hiding at various places after he fled from <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a>. After the Northern and Southern Courts were established, he was pardoned by the Southern Court (Japan) in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Yoshino.html">Yoshino</a> and fought against Ashikaga's forces as a member of the forces of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/family/Nitta clan.html">Nitta clan</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Akiie KITABATAKE.html">Akiie KITABATAKE</a>. However, he was captured by Ashikaga's force in 1352 and was executed in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> in the next year. </p>
