<h1>Daijokancho (太政官牒)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Daijokancho are official documents sent from Daijokan to organizations not under its direct control such as sogo and Buddhist temples. It is also called simply "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Kancho.html">kancho</a>." Daijokancho were actively used during the Heian period. </p>
<p>Cho was at first a kind of document used in kushikiryo (according to he <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ritsuryo.html">Ritsuryo</a> system) when a low- or medium-ranked government official higher than <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Sakan (Kokushi).html">sakan</a> submitted a petition to a higher government official, it was later used as texts exchanged between the office of Monastic affairs or Buddhist temples and a government official. While <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Daijokanpu.html">daijokanpu</a> was normally used to send a daijokan's order, daijokancho, a less imperative document, was used to send it to Buddhist temples because daijokan did not have a direct vassal relationship with Buddhist temples. </p>
<p>A letter 'cho' was placed under a sender and at the beginning of a text, the text was closed by letters '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kocho (The Tale of Genji).html">kocho</a>' and the date was followed by the signatures of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Benkan (Collective name of posts in Daijokan).html">benkan</a> and recorder (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ritsuryo.html">ritsuryo</a> system) who made the dajokancho. </p>
