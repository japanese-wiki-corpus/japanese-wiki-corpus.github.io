<h1>Kugutsu (傀儡子)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kugutsu were groups of people who traveled around the country and made a living in the performing arts, appearing on the records from around the ninth century. </p>
<p>They are said to have used magic to conduct various performances, particularly the control of puppets. 
<br/>They were also written as kugutsushi (傀儡師) and females were called 'kugutsume.'<br/>
</p>
<p>Due to their livelihood, their relationship to subsequent groups such as miko (shrine maidens), Kabuki (traditional drama performed by male actors) performers, ichigo (female fortune-tellers) and Itako (The Japanese shaman) has been identified. </p>
