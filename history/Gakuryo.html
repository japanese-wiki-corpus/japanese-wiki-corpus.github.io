<h1>Gakuryo (学令)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Gakuryo was one of the articles in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ritsuryo.html">ritsuryo</a> codes (legal codes of the Nara and Heian periods). It defined the regulations on the educational institutions for training <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Kanjin.html">kanjin</a> (government officials). It was ranked the 11th in the Yoro <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ritsuryo.html">ritsuryo</a> code and made up of twenty-two articles. </p>
<p>The Japanese <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ritsuryo.html">Ritsuryo</a> code mainly defined structures of Daigakuryo (Bureau of Education) and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Kokugaku.html">kokugaku</a> (provincial schools), and their teachers and students. </p>
<p>The Yoro <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ritsuryo.html">ritsuryo</a> code consisted of the followings:<br/>
Hakase/assistant professor (qualification for an instructor)<br/>
Gakusho or a student (qualification for a student at Daigakuryo or <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Kokugaku.html">kokugaku</a>)<br/>
Sekiten (a ceremony to worship Confucius which was taken place in spring)<br/>
Zaigaku Ijo (order in school)<br/>
Kei Shueki Shosho (textbooks for Confucianism)<br/>
Kyoju Shogo (commentaries used in class)<br/>
Raiki Saden Kakui Daikyo (selective subjects)<br/>
Sendoku Kyomon (how to take classes)<br/>
Bunkyo Kyoju (how to give lectures)<br/>
Ikoka Tokyu (how to evaluate instructors)<br/>
Tsunikyo (employing excellent long-term learners as government officials)<br/>
Kosetsu Fucho (employing government officials by examination)<br/>
Sankei (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Sando.html">sando</a> or arithmetic)<br/>
Kai Keigi (in cases of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kokushi.html">kokushi</a> (provincial governors) or <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Gunji.html">gunji</a> (district managers) acting as instructors)<br/>
Sho <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Gakusei (educational system, the Education System Order).html">gakusei</a> (examinations to students of calligraphy (Daigakuryo), <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Sando.html">sando</a> and so on)<br/>
Seika (gakusho's application for leave)<br/>
Gyorei (gakusho's courtesy in attending ceremonies)<br/>
Futoku Sagaku (gakusho's life attitudes)<br/>
Somo (gakusho who took mourning leave for a parent)<br/>
Hodenka (special holidays to gakusho)<br/>
Hikaitai (withdrawal from school)<br/>
<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Koshi (Imperial Heir).html">Koshi</a> (gakusho's <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Observation.html">observation</a> of ceremonies)<br/>
</p>
<p>Articles 5 to13 were all related to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Myogyodo.html">Myogyodo</a> that dealt with Confucianism (after all, it is thought that at the time of establishing Daigakuryo only a regular course corresponding to later Myokyodo and sanka corresponding to arithmetic virtually existed. However, in fact <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kidendo.html">Kidendo</a> (the study of the histories), which did not exist at the birth of daigaku and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Kokugaku.html">kokugaku</a>, came to be valued highly, and the educational system of daigaku and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Kokugaku.html">kokugaku</a> was changed into Kidendo-oriented one. </p>
