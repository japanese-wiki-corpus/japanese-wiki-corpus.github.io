<h1>Kokudaka (The Figure Of Land Productivity) (石高)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kokudaka refers to the figure of land productivity shown with koku (a unit), which was used in the early modern ages of Japan. Taxation on land was implemented according to kokudaka from the time of Taiko <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Kenchi.html">kenchi</a> (the land survey by <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI.html">Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI</a>) until the land-tax reform in the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period. And so, kokudaka also showed the income of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> (Japanese territorial lords) and that of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Hatamoto (direct retainers of shogun).html">hatamoto</a> (direct retainers of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> [Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>]). </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>From the time of Taiko <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Kenchi.html">kenchi</a> through the Edo period, the economic value of all kinds of land such as rice (or vegetable) field and residential area, was converted into the productivity of rice, and the productivity, whose unit was koku, was calculated by multiplying the land size by a fixed figure called <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Kokumori.html">kokumori</a> (land's productivity per 'tan' [a Japanese area unit]). This was called kokudaka system, and the output of crops other than rice and seafood was converted into the output of rice of the same economic value as those products. Kokudaka was used to show the income of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> including <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> gained from their territory, and to show the retainers' salary given from the lord as well. Kokudaka system is sometimes called '<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Hyakusho.html">hyakusho</a> takashoji' (system to measure the property of a farmer with kokudaka) when mentioned for the farmer, or called 'kokudaka <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Chigyo.html">chigyo</a> system' (system to measure the annual stipend of a <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> with kokudaka) when mentioned for <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> (especially <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a>). Kokudaka system lasted until the land-tax reform in the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period. </p>
<p>1 koku was equal to the amount of rice consumed by an adult man in a year, so if 1 koku of rice is equated with the reward for a soldier, the kokudaka multiplied by the rate of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Nengu (Land Tax).html">nengu</a> (land-tax) implies the number of soldiers fed. In other words, kokudaka showed not only the financial power but also the troop strength of Sengoku <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> (Japanese territorial lord in the Sengoku period). The order of military service issued by <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> in the Edo period enforced <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> to mobilize about 200 people (including noncombatants) for every 10,000 koku of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Omote-daka (face value of kokudaka assessed by the feudal government).html">omote-daka</a> (kokudaka officially recognized by the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Edo bakufu.html">Edo bakufu</a>). <h3>Kokudaka of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a></h3>
</p>
<p>The following is only the figure officially recognized by the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Edo bakufu.html">Edo bakufu</a> (<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Omote-daka (face value of kokudaka assessed by the feudal government).html">omote-daka</a>) of local domains, and their <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Uchi-daka (real value of the yield).html">uchi-daka</a> (real figure of rice harvest) was quite different from their <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Omote-daka (face value of kokudaka assessed by the feudal government).html">omote-daka</a> in many cases. For details, please refer to the article of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Uchi-daka (real value of the yield).html">Uchi-daka</a>. </p>
