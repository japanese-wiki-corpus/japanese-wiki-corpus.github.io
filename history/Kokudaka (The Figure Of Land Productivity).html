<h1>Kokudaka (The Figure Of Land Productivity) (石高)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kokudaka refers to the figure of land productivity shown with koku (a unit), which was used in the early modern ages of Japan. Taxation on land was implemented according to kokudaka from the time of Taiko kenchi (the land survey by Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI) until the land-tax reform in the Meiji period. And so, kokudaka also showed the income of daimyo (Japanese territorial lords) and that of hatamoto (direct retainers of bakufu [Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun]). </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>From the time of Taiko kenchi through the Edo period, the economic value of all kinds of land such as rice (or vegetable) field and residential area, was converted into the productivity of rice, and the productivity, whose unit was koku, was calculated by multiplying the land size by a fixed figure called kokumori (land's productivity per 'tan' [a Japanese area unit]). This was called kokudaka system, and the output of crops other than rice and seafood was converted into the output of rice of the same economic value as those products. Kokudaka was used to show the income of samurai including daimyo gained from their territory, and to show the retainers' salary given from the lord as well. Kokudaka system is sometimes called 'hyakusho takashoji' (system to measure the property of a farmer with kokudaka) when mentioned for the farmer, or called 'kokudaka chigyo system' (system to measure the annual stipend of a samurai with kokudaka) when mentioned for samurai (especially daimyo). Kokudaka system lasted until the land-tax reform in the Meiji period. </p>
<p>1 koku was equal to the amount of rice consumed by an adult man in a year, so if 1 koku of rice is equated with the reward for a soldier, the kokudaka multiplied by the rate of nengu (land-tax) implies the number of soldiers fed. In other words, kokudaka showed not only the financial power but also the troop strength of Sengoku daimyo (Japanese territorial lord in the Sengoku period). The order of military service issued by bakufu in the Edo period enforced daimyo to mobilize about 200 people (including noncombatants) for every 10,000 koku of omote-daka (kokudaka officially recognized by the Edo bakufu). <h3>Kokudaka of daimyo</h3>
