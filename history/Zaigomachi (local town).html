<h1>Zaigomachi (local town) (在郷町)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Zaigomachi was one of Japanese city forms. </p>
<p>Summary<br/>
It was a town or settlement developed as commodity production grew in rural communities such as a farming village from the Medieval period to early Modern period in Japan. </p>
<p>In some cases farming villages on Highways, Zaigomachi developed along the Highway. </p>
<p>Zaigomachi was different from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Jokamachi.html">Jokamachi</a> (castle town) or <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Jinyamachi (town around feudal lords residence).html">Jinyamachi</a> (town around the feudal lord's residence) which prospered around the castle or the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Hancho (domain office).html">hancho</a> (feudal lord's office/residence), Shukubamachi (post station town) which was formed around <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shukuba (posting stations).html">shukuba</a> (post station), or Monzenmachi (temple town) formed around a temple or a shrine and did not have any landmark featuring the town (castle, big post station, large temple or shrine, or the like) and it spontaneously developed in farming villages a distance from the aforementioned machi (towns). </p>
<p>Unlike such towns as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Jokamachi.html">Jokamachi</a>, Zaigomachi was characteristic of many farmers as its residents and those engaged in commerce and industry, and has both features of being an urban district and a farming village. 
<br/>In contrast to such towns as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Jokamachi.html">Jokamachi</a>, Zaigomachi was categorized as something like a 'local city.'<br/>
</p>
<p>Some Zaigomachi were categorized as Shitamachi (neighborhoods of merchants and artisans), and many of the districts originated from Zaigomachi in modern Japan were towns with such a friendly atmosphere that they can be called modern versions of Shitamachi. </p>
