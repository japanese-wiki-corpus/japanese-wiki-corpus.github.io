<h1>Gakunodo (額の堂)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Gakunodo is a name for a facility inside an armed camp during the Sengoku period. </p>
<p>Summary<br/>
In the Koshu style, it indicated a sentry box. Two bamboo sticks were bent in the center, inserted in the ground, and then a paper treated with astringent persimmon juice was attached like a curtain. It was used as a shelter from the rain for a sentry at the front-line or when guarding the headquarters of Daisho (Major Captain). </p>
<p>In the Yamaga style, it was similar to the Koshu style except for the paper treated with astringent persimmon juice was attached on the framework made by bamboo sticks. </p>
<p>In the Kenshin style, gakunodo indicated a tsumesho (a station) for warriors. It was located on the opposite side of the headquarters, in front of which was a crisscross bank. The left side throws outward and the right side was pulled in. Suigai (see-through fence) was made at the front and behind the gakunodo. It prevented the enemies from eavesdropping. A document of hatto (law, ban) was attached on the wall, and a drum and a gong were also placed on the wall. </p>
