<h1>Offense and Defense in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Omi Province.html">Omi Province</a> (近江攻防)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The offense and defense in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Omi Province.html">Omi Province</a> were a series of battles between <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Omi-Genji (Minamoto clan).html">Omi-Genji</a> (the Minamoto clan) and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Onjo-ji Temple.html">Onjo-ji Temple</a>'s armed priests versus Heike (the Taira family) during the Jisho-Juei War. </p>
<p><h3>Progress</h3>
</p>
<p>After Heike was defeated in the Battle of Fujigawa in October, 1180, Genji in the Owari Province and the Mino Province rose in revolt on November 17 of the same year ("<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Gyokuyo.html">Gyokuyo</a>"[Diary of FUJIWARA no Kanezane]). Afterwards, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshitsune YAMAMOTO.html">Yoshitsune YAMAMOTO</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshikane KASHIWAGI.html">Yoshikane KASHIWAGI</a> brothers raised an army on November 20. The uprising <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Omi-Genji (Minamoto clan).html">Omi-Genji</a> occupied <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Lake Biwa.html">Lake Biwa</a> that was the main artery for distributing goods between the Hokuriku Region and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Heian-kyo.html">Heian-kyo</a> (the ancient capital of Japan in current <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>) and seized <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Nengu (Land Tax).html">nengu</a> (land tax) on the way from the Hokuriku Region to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Heian-kyo.html">Heian-kyo</a>. 
<br/>The armed priests of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Onjo-ji Temple.html">Onjo-ji Temple</a> also allied with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Omi-Genji (Minamoto clan).html">Omi-Genji</a> and the allied forces' power was strong enough to occupy <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Heian-kyo.html">Heian-kyo</a> at one time<br/>
It is assumed that <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Omi-Genji (Minamoto clan).html">Omi-Genji</a> was in contact with Kai-Genji in Togoku (the eastern part of Japan, particularly Kanto region), as "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Gyokuyo.html">Gyokuyo</a>" described that <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Omi-Genji (Minamoto clan).html">Omi-Genji</a> was probably contacting Nobuyoshi TAKEDA. It is also written in "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Gyokuyo.html">Gyokuyo</a>" that <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Zaichokanjin.html">Zaichokanjin</a> (local district officials) in the Wakasa Province was likely in support of the uprising, so the sign of the Hokuriku's uprisings to increase was recognized. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, Heike went on the counteroffensive by raising the uprising power in the Kinai region (the five capital provinces surrounding the ancient capitals of Nara and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>). <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/The Imperial Court.html">The Imperial Court</a> decided to change the capital which had been located in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Fukuhara-kyo (Capital of Fukuhara).html">Fukuhara-kyo</a> to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Heian-kyo.html">Heian-kyo</a> on November 21. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/TAIRA no Kiyomori.html">TAIRA no Kiyomori</a> returned to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Heian-kyo.html">Heian-kyo</a> on the 26th. Then, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Takakura.html">Emperor Takakura</a> issued <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Inzen (a decree from the retired Emperor).html">inzen</a> (a decree from the retired Emperor) which declared the hunting down and killing of the rebels against Omi Temple's troops. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/TAIRA no Ietsugu.html">TAIRA no Ietsugu</a>, Heike's <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kenin.html">Kenin</a> (a retainer), started an attack against Omi Genji on December 1 and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/TAIRA no Tomonori.html">TAIRA no Tomonori</a> headed for the battle for an additional attack on 2nd. Tomomori and others defeated <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Omi-Genji (Minamoto clan).html">Omi-Genji</a> in the battle that took place on 6th. Many soldiers defeated in this battle fled to the Mino Province and kept up the resistance. Heike attacked the armed priests who agreed to support the rebel troops in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Onjo-ji Temple.html">Onjo-ji Temple</a>; as a result, a part of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Onjo-ji Temple.html">Onjo-ji Temple</a> blazed up. </p>
<p>On December 24 <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshitsune YAMAMOTO.html">Yoshitsune YAMAMOTO</a>, who kept up the resistance in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Omi Province.html">Omi Province</a> and shut himself up in Mabuchi-jo Castle, was finally forced to flee ("<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Gyokuyo.html">Gyokuyo</a>"). However, it is confirmed that <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshitsune YAMAMOTO.html">Yoshitsune YAMAMOTO</a> kept up the resistance and shut himself up in Yamamoto-jo Castle around December 24 ("<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Gyokuyo.html">Gyokuyo</a>"). Afterwards, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshitsune YAMAMOTO.html">Yoshitsune YAMAMOTO</a> accompanied <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Yoshinaka.html">MINAMOTO no Yoshinaka</a>'s army to attack <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Heian-kyo.html">Heian-kyo</a> in 1183. </p>
<p>The offense and defense in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Omi Province.html">Omi Province</a> came near the end in December; the revel activity gained momentum in Nara and Genji in the Owari and Mino Provinces kept up the rebellion until next year. </p>
