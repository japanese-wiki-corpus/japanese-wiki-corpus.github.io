<h1>Jungido (遵義堂)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>"Jungido" is a hanko (school for the descendants of feudal lords) founded by the Zeze clan in 1808. </p>
<p>The 10th feudal lord Yasusada HONDA, founded the school in September 1808 at the suggestion of Kien NINAGAWA, a Confusian scholar. Tenarai (Japanese calligraphy) and Shishogokyo (the Four Books and Five Classics of Confucianism, otherwise known as the Nine Chinese Classics) were taught, and Western studies and Western gunnery were added to the curriculum at the end of the Edo period. Currently, Zeze Koto Gakko (high school), a Shiga prefectural high school, is built on the former site of Jungido. </p>
