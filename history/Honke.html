<h1>Honke (本家)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Honke is a nominal owner of the highest-graded patches of land under the stratified land ruling structure of Japanese <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Shoen.html">Shoen</a> (refer to the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shiki (a rank in government offices under ritsuryo system).html">Shiki</a> system in the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> koryo sei (The System of Public Lands and Private Estates) section). Honke were usually the Innomiya family, Sekkan-ke (families that produced regents and advisers), and major temples and shrines that received donations from <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Ryoke.html">ryoke</a> (a lord of the manor) that had received donations from kaihatsu ryoshu (local notables who actually developed the land). Honke is also called Soke. </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>Starting from the late 10th century or the 11th century, which was the middle of the Heian period, local kaihatsu ryoshu started to donate their private lands (<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a>) that they illegally owned to the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Zuryo (The Head of The Provincial Governors).html">zuryo</a> (provincial officers such as dominant nobilities, temples, and shrines in the capital) in order to escape from confiscation by the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Kokuga (provincial government office compounds).html">kokuga</a> (provincial government offices). Then, these kaihatsu ryoshu paid a certain amount of tax to the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Zuryo (The Head of The Provincial Governors).html">zuryo</a> while holding the right to control those donated lands as <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shokan.html">shokan</a>, or officers governing <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> (donation while retaining authority). <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Ryoke.html">Ryoke</a> were the ones who received donations from kaihatsu ryoshu. <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Ryoke.html">Ryoke</a> appointed kaihatsu ryoshu to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shokan.html">shokan</a> to manage the lands, and through them, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Ryoke.html">ryoke</a> obtained income for themselves by collecting harvests from <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> as <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Jishi.html">jishi</a> (land taxes under the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Ritsuryo.html">Ritsuryo</a> system) and required peasants (<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Shomin.html">shomin</a>) who worked within <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> to provide labor for kuji (public duties). These rights to profit from <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Ryoke.html">ryoke</a> (sakuai or each <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shiki (a rank in government offices under ritsuryo system).html">shiki</a>'s <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Share.html">share</a> of collected taxes) such as the right to control, collect <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Jishi.html">jishi</a>, and impose labor services as <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> ryoshu (lord of the manor) were called <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Ryoke.html">ryoke</a> <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shiki (a rank in government offices under ritsuryo system).html">shiki</a> (economic rights as a lord of the manor). </p>
<p>Meanwhile, being granted a more powerful authority due to the contract system of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Kokushi.html">kokushi</a> (provincial governors), <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Kokushi.html">kokushi</a> often executed confiscation on grounds of the Manor Regulation Act issued as a 'new policy' when the Emperor changed in order to increase <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Kokugaryo.html">kokugaryo</a> (territories governed by the provincial government office) as their own territories; therefore, there were many cases that the authority of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Ryoke.html">ryoke</a> was insufficient to maintain <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Shoen.html">Shoen</a> ownership. For this reason, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Ryoke.html">ryoke</a> donated a part of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Ryoke.html">ryoke</a> <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shiki (a rank in government offices under ritsuryo system).html">shiki</a> to more influential families such as the Innomiya family, Sekkan-ke, and major temples and shrines. The sakuai that the influential families had was called honke <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shiki (a rank in government offices under ritsuryo system).html">shiki</a> (the right that the honke had). Note that, if kaihatsu ryoshu donated their <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> directly to influential families, these <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> would only have honke and no <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Ryoke.html">ryoke</a>. Among honke and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Ryoke.html">ryoke</a>, the families that had effective dominion over <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> were called <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Honjo (proprietor or guarantor of manor).html">honjo</a> (proprietors or guarantors of a manor). In some cases, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Honjo (proprietor or guarantor of manor).html">honjo</a> gave the shoen-related rights or profit partially to other aristocrats and called these aristocrats <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Ryoke.html">ryoke</a>. </p>
<p>As time passed, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shokan.html">shokan</a> started to become <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a>, and from the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period and on, the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>) appointed <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shokan.html">shokan</a> to jito (managers and lords of a manor). Jito abolished the traditional stratified land ruling relationships and preferred centralized land ruling. Such centralized ruling of lands refers to ichien <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Chigyo.html">chigyo</a> (monistic ruling), and establishment of the jitouke system (the contract system where the manor's owner entrusts a jito to manage his manor and pay the customs) started in Togoku (the eastern part of Japan, particularly Kanto region). Meanwhile, in Saigoku (western part of Japan (esp. Kyushu, but ranging as far east as Kinki), peasants strengthened their territorial bonds, formed villages, and established the hyakushouke system (the contract system where the manor's owner entrusts a peasant to manage his manor and pay the customs) to operate <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> independent of jito's management. Also, shitaji chubun (physical division of land) started to take place as a solution to a conflict between jito and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> ryoshu over sakuai. </p>
<p>In the Muromachi period, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a> (provincial constables) became powerful and lowered official positions of jito and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Kokujin.html">kokujin</a> (local <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a>) from the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period including <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Zaichokanjin.html">zaichokanjin</a> (local officials in the Heian and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> periods) and started to control the lands owned by <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Kokuga (provincial government office compounds).html">kokuga</a>, jito, or <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Kokujin.html">kokujin</a> with the goal to establish the shugo-ryogoku system (the system where a <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a> dominates a manor). During this period, the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Shugouke.html">shugouke</a> system was widely used in which honke or <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Ryoke.html">ryoke</a> entrusted <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a> to manage <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> in the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a>'s own territories and paid <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Nengu (Land Tax).html">nengu</a> (<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Jishi.html">jishi</a> and kuji combined) to honke or <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Ryoke.html">ryoke</a>. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shiki (a rank in government offices under ritsuryo system).html">shiki</a> itself shifted from being an expression of an official position to being the right to tax profit, and there were cases where honke or <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Ryoke.html">ryoke</a> directly held the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shiki (a rank in government offices under ritsuryo system).html">shiki</a> of a local lord, or the other way around meaning local lords holding the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shiki (a rank in government offices under ritsuryo system).html">shiki</a> of honke or <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Ryoke.html">ryoke</a>. Furthermore, owing to the Muromachi <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> system in which interests of court nobles and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> could be comprehensively adjusted, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> restructuring was implemented through, for example shitaji chubun, and as a result, management of ichienryo (ichien territories) or bukeichienryo (ichien territories of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> families) by <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Jisha (Buddhist Temples and Shinto Shrines).html">jisha</a> <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Honjo (proprietor or guarantor of manor).html">honjo</a> was established. </p>
<p>In the Sengoku period (period of Warring States), <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a> <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> (Japanese territorial lords as provincial constables) were replaced with sengoku <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> (Japanese territorial lord in the Sengoku period) and the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> system (manorialism) collapsed because sengoku <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> further advanced ichien <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Chigyo.html">chigyo</a> of lands. </p>
<p>In the end, as a result of taiko <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Kenchi.html">kenchi</a> (the cadastral surveys conducted by Hideyoshi), the right to a particular area of land was granted only to the cultivator of that land, and positions such as honke and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Ryoke.html">ryoke</a> disappeared. </p>
