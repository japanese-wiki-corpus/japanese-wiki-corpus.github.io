<h1>Datsua Nyuo (Leave Asia, enter Europe) (脱亜入欧)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Datsua Nyuo (Leave Asia, enter Europe) is a Japanese slogan or thought that 'Japan should get out of Asia which belongs to the Third World, and catch up with European powers.'<br/>
</p>
<p>Meaning<br/>
At the end of the 19th century, when the allied western powers were fighting colonial wars one another, the Japanese government carried out a new policy based on this thought with a slogan '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Fukoku kyohei (fortifying the country, strengthening the military).html">Fukoku kyohei</a>' (fortifying the country, strengthening the military). There is a theory that this policy led Japan to invasions of courtiers in the Asian Continent such as Korea and China. </p>
<p>The famous concrete examples of 'Leave Asia, enter Europe' were the history of Japanese <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Fashion.html">fashion</a>, the decree banning the wearing of swords and Rokumeikan (a hall used for the accommodation of guests of the government) built in the 1880s. </p>
<p>Datsuaron' (a editorial for urging to leave Asia) is thought to be written by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yukichi FUKUZAWA (educator).html">Yukichi FUKUZAWA</a>, and it is said that FUKUZAWA wrote this editorial based on the thought of 'Leave Asia, enter Europe.'<br/>
Many people still misunderstand, but <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yukichi FUKUZAWA (educator).html">Yukichi FUKUZAWA</a> never used the expression 'Enter Europe' in all his literally works and editorials of Jijishinpo (Japanese newspaper). </p>
<p>On the other hand, paradoxically, there is a widely-accepted theory that Pan-Asianism (a movement that Asian nations unite and solidify and create a continental identity to defeat the designs of the Western nations to perpetuate hegemony) led Japan to the invasions of China and Korea. </p>
