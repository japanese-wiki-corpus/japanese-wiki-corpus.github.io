<h1>Fuchu (provincial cities which consist of local governments as the core of the city) (府中)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Fuchu is another name for <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kokufu.html">kokufu</a>, an urban area established around its local government office (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kokuga (provincial government office compounds).html">kokuga</a>) in the ryoseikoku (province). However, some of Fuchu are derived from the fact that they were where those <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shugosho (provincial administration).html">shugosho</a> (the site for provincial administration during the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> and Muromachi Period) were located. 
<br/>It is the same meaning of 'Funai.'<br/>
</p>
