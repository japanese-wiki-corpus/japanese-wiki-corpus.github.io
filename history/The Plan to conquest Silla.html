<h1>The Plan to conquest Silla (新羅征討計画)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The plan to conquest Silla was a plan for military action in the Korean Peninsula during the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Asuka (飛鳥 in Chinese characters, the name of present-day Asuka Village, Nara Prefecture).html">Asuka</a> period. </p>
<p>The Japanese Mimana Government was taken over by Silla in 562. In order to reestablish the Japanese Mimana Government, Emperor <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Suiko.html">Suiko</a> planned and executed a 'Seitogun' (an expeditionary force). SAKAIBE no Omi was appointed general of the first Seitogun in 600. The second Seitogun was organized in 602 by appointing Prince Kume, the younger brother of Prince Shotoku, as the general of the Seitogun, however, the plan was called off due to the death of Prince Kume from illness. </p>
