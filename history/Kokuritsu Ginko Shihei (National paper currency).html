<h1>Kokuritsu Ginko Shihei (National paper currency) (国立銀行紙幣)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kokuritsu Ginko Shihei was paper currency issued by the National Bank in the early Meiji Period. </p>
<p><h3>Historical backdrop and summery</h3>
</p>
<p>Currencies such as Meiji Tsuho (government note in Meiji Period) which was issued after the Meiji Restoration were inconvertible paper currency (paper currency which was not assured an exchange with standard money, such as gold and silver), and at that time, gold standard system was an international trend, so Japan also needed to issue convertible currency (paper currency which was assured an exchange with standard money). The Meiji Government left an establishment of the gold standard system to the private sector, and enacted a regulation of national bank in 1872, (to establish issue banks with private capital, and oblige them to issue convertible currency). Four national banks (in Meiji Period) were built and convertible Kokuritsu Ginko Shihei was issued since 1873. But they ran into financial difficulty due to the lack of gold coins, and since the regulation of national bank was forced to be amended to permit issuance of inconvertible currency, the number of banks increased abruptly and new Kokuritsu Ginko Shihei (inconvertible currency) was issued. <h3>Characteristics</h3>
