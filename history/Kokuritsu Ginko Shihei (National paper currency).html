The Meiji Government left an establishment of the gold standard system to the private sector, and enacted a regulation of national bank in 1872, (to establish issue banks with private capital, and oblige them to issue convertible currency). Four national banks (in Meiji Period) were built and convertible Kokuritsu Ginko Shihei was issued since 1873. But they ran into financial difficulty due to the lack of gold coins, and since the regulation of national bank was forced to be amended to permit issuance of inconvertible currency, the number of banks increased abruptly and new Kokuritsu Ginko Shihei (inconvertible currency) was issued. <h3>Characteristics</h3>
