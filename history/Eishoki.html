<h1>Eishoki (永昌記)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Eishoki was the diary of the late Heian Period courtier FUJIWARA no Tametaka. Also called "the Tametaka gyo ki". The name Eishoki comes from the fact that Shijobomon in Sakyo where Tametaka lived was within the Eishobo. The existing article spans 25 years from 1105 to 1129, but many segments are missing. Various ceremonies such as events, investitures, and incantations that happened during the eras of the three emperors, Emperor Horikawa, Emperor Toba and Emperor Sutoku (in other words, the cloistered government period of Shirakawa and Toba) are described in detail and the document is treasured by researchers as a well-written knowledgeable account. </p>
