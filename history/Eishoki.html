<h1>Eishoki (永昌記)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Eishoki was the diary of the late Heian Period courtier FUJIWARA no Tametaka. Also called "the Tametaka gyo ki". The name Eishoki comes from the fact that Shijobomon in Sakyo where Tametaka lived was within the Eishobo. The existing article spans 25 years from 1105 to 1129, but many segments are missing.
