<h1>
Shoya (village headman) (庄屋)
</h1>

<p></p>
<p>The Shoya (village headman) and the Nanushi (village headman) are one of village officers ("murakata-sanyaku" in Japanese; the three officers of a village), or one of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Machiyakunin (Municipal Official).html">machiyakunin</a> (municipal officials) in Edo period. </p>
<p>Each Shoya and Nanushi of a village was one of the three officers of a village ("jikata-sanyaku" in Japanese), and the official representative person for the village. In western Japan, the term Shoya was the commonly used name, and Nanushi was the commonly used name in eastern Japan. Additionally, in the regions of Tohoku and Hokuriku, the term Kimoiri (sponsorship) was the commonly used name. </p>
<p>Each Shoya and Nanushi of a town was one of the machi-yakunin (municipal officials) and the official representative person of the town. It is also called a Cho-Nanushi (a town headman), Cho-Shoya (a town headman), and Shihai-Nanushi (a town headman). Machi-Nushi was a familiar name for a town headman. </p>
<p><h3>Function</h3>
</p>
<p>Under the Murauke (also called "Murauke-sei"; a subcontracting system for a village in the Edo period), a village Shoya or Nanushi engaged in the administration of subcontract works, mainly for taxations such as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Nengu (Land Tax).html">nengu</a> (land tax) and miscellaneous taxes, and other administrative business. Also, they subcontracted various business concerning the control over the village's residents: Horei junshu (compliance with laws and ordinances), Joikatatsu (conveying the will of the governing to the governed), Ninbetsu shihai (census-taking control), and land management. In other words, they were positioned in the smallest unit of a controlling organization. However, on the other hand, as a representative of a village a Shoya or Nanushi represented his interest for the benefit of the village residents; such as, acting as a leader of a protest movement toward a reduction and/or exemption from a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Nengu (Land Tax).html">nengu</a> (land tax). 
<br/>Such an aspect that the Shoya or Nanushi represented to the village is known as 'Soudaikinou.'<br/>
In practice, such functions of the Shoya or Nanushi as the smallest unit of a controlling organization and as the representation for the village residents were contradictive. Thus, through early-modern times it resulted in a negative influence upon the Shoya and Nanushi and destabilized the intent of their actions. </p>
<p>Shoya or Nanushi directed public works (engineering works) such as an irrigation channel. Some constructions Shoya built still remain today. </p>
<p>In the late modern times, when the power of the feudal lords waned, a lord of the shogunate system tried to deny the Soudaikinou (a function of village residents' representative) function of a Shoya and Nanushi. In some cases, a load of the shogunate system established new positions such as 'Torishimariyaku' for a village. Howevr, through out the early-modern times, lords of the shogunate system could not wipe out the 'Soudaikinou' function of a Shoya and Nanushi. The assignment of the Soudaikinou function of Shoya and Nanushi would be carried over to the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> government. <h3>Selection procedures and compensation for the position of a Shoya and Nanushi</h3>
</p>
<p>The procedures for the selection of a Shoya or Nanushi were often dependent upon the customs of each individual village. There were three selection procedures for the position: (1) the Heredity Nanushi system would require the legacy in a member of the same family having successively assumed an office in a Nanushi or Shoya position; (2) the Nenban Nanushi system required a yearly family rotation; (3) the final procedural type was a hybrid of the former two (This type was not <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Heredity.html">heredity</a>, but certain persons served in the position for several years). Additionally, there were cases that residents of a village executed an election called 'Irefuda' (vote) to select a Nanushi or Shoya. The desired forms in the selection procedures were entirely dependent upon the various regions and diversification by each villages even in the same regions. </p>
<p>There were three types of compensation for serving in these positions: (1) Payments by a feudal load: (2) Payments through village finance, called 'Muraninyo': (3) Payments in designated land, named '<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kyuden.html">Kyuden</a>.'<br/>
These desired forms of compensational practice were dependent on the various regions and diversification by each village even in the same regions. <h3>O-joya (also pronounced "O-shoya"; a superior village headman, a village official)</h3>
</p>
<p>Differing from the Nanushi or Shoya, there were some cases that the position called Oshoya (a big village headman) was established to control several villages or more. Besides 'O-joya,' this position's name varied by region under the names of: "Onanushi," "Warimoto (a village official)," "Kimoiri (a sponsor, middleman, and also a village official)," "To-mura (a manger or an official to control villages, ten villages or more as a group)", and "Gougashira." <h3>Nanushi in Edo (old name of Tokyo)</h3>
</p>
<p>Edo town was originally composed of only homeowners, that is townspeople, and Nanushi was a representative of a town. However, most people of the homeowner class were absent from the town at an early stage and finally Nanushi of a town had disappeared at the end of the seventeenth century in Edo. Instead of a Nanushi of the town, Yamori (a manger who works for a homeowner or a landowner) who was to become a deputy of the homeowner, emerged. Then, Gachi-gyoji who was a representative of Yamori came to be a representative of a town. <h3>Nanushi of local castle towns</h3>
