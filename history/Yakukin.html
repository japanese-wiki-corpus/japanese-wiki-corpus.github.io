<h1>Yakukin (役金)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Yakukin is a kind of allowance or expense paid to the retainers of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> by the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Edo bakufu.html">Edo bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>). </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>Yakukin were provided to those who were in certain posts such as ongoku <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Bugyo.html">bugyo</a> (magistrates assigned to key domains under the direct control of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>), in addition to the executive allowances called <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yakuryo (executive allowance).html">yakuryo</a>. It is also said the yakukin is a substitute for <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yakuryo (executive allowance).html">yakuryo</a>, but yakukin is now regarded as another allowance deriving from a different system since yakukin was paid together with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yakuryo (executive allowance).html">yakuryo</a> in some cases. Yakukin was paid mainly to officers working in provincial areas, including high-ranking <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Bugyo.html">bugyo</a> and middle-ranking kumigashira. According to "Richo" (a book on office organizations in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Edo bakufu.html">Edo bakufu</a>), 30,000 ryo was paid to Nagasaki <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Bugyo.html">bugyo</a>, 100 ryo to each <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Bugyo.html">bugyo</a> shihai kumigashira (officers supporting <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Bugyo.html">bugyo</a>) in Nagasaki, Uraga and Sado, 70 ryo to those in Niigata, 80 ryo to tsutsumi <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Bugyo.html">bugyo</a> (magistrate in charge of river banks) concurrently working as kaisen aratameyaku (supervisor in charge of cargo vessels) in Sekka Shu (Kawachi Province), 25 ryo to gonyuyo torishirabeyaku (auditor for the Kyoto Imperial Palace) in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, 10 ryo to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Bugyo.html">bugyo</a> shihai ginmiyaku (officers supporting <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Bugyo.html">bugyo</a>) in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Nikko.html">Nikko</a>, and 20 ryo each to ozendokoro kumigashira (head of the food department) and okuozendokoro kumigashira (head of the inner palace food department). </p>
<p>On October 23, 1867, the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Edo bakufu.html">Edo bakufu</a> made reform by introducing a system to collect a half of the territory revenue instead of the abolished military service system applied to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Hatamoto (direct retainers of shogun).html">hatamoto</a> (direct retainers of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>) and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Gokenin.html">gokenin</a> (vassals) while integrating <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yakuryo (executive allowance).html">yakuryo</a>, tashidaka (supplementary stipends), <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yakuryo (executive allowance).html">yakuryo</a> and yakubuchi (monthly salaries) paid to those who were in hoi and higher positions (from Jushiinojo [Junior Fourth Rank, Upper Grade] Upper Grade) to Jugoinoge [Junior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade]) into yakikin. Typical yakukin were 10,000 ryo paid to roju (members of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>'s council of elders), 5,000 ryo to the posts equal to roju, 4,000 ryo to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Wakadoshiyori.html">wakadoshiyori</a> (the position next to roju) and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Sobayonin (lord chamberlain).html">sobayonin</a> (political coordinators), and 2,500 ryo to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Rusui (a governmental post placed in the Edo bakufu and in domains).html">rusui</a> (officer in charge of the Inner Palace), rikugun <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Bugyo.html">bugyo</a> nami (deputy magistrate in charge of army), kaigun <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Bugyo.html">bugyo</a> nami (deputy magistrate in charge of navy), gaikoku sobugyo nami (deputy general magistrate in charge of foreign affairs), <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Ometsuke (inspector general).html">ometsuke</a> (chief inspector of the Edo shogunate), machi <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Bugyo.html">bugyo</a> (magistrate in charge of administration of Edo), and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Kanjo.html">kanjo</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Bugyo.html">bugyo</a> (commissioner of finance) (however, these amounts were restricted according to stipends of the territory). The collection of military service fees and payment of yakukin allowances was to be done quarterly (in March, June, September and December), but this system ended without functioning in full due to the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Taisei Hokan (transfer of power back to the Emperor).html">Taisei Hokan</a> (transfer of power back to the Emperor) implemented in the following month. </p>
<p>However, in some cases, the word "yakukin" was used in different meanings from the above: for example, salaries paid to village and town representatives, impositions on bankers, and impositions on pond fishers as "pond fishing charges." </p>
