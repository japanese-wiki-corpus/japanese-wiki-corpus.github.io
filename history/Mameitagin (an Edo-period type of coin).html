<h1>Mameitagin (an Edo-period type of coin) (豆板銀)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Mameitagin is a name for silver coins circulated in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Edo Period.html">Edo Period</a>. They are also called Kotsubugin (pea-size silver) or Kodamagin (small ball silver). At that time, the formal name used at <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Ginza (History).html">Ginza</a> (an organization in charge of casting and appraising of silver during the Edo period) was 'Kodamagin,' but in the books of old coinage, such as "Kinginzuroku" (Gold & Silver catalog) and "Sanka zui" (Illustrations of the three types of money), it was recorded under the name of 'Mameitagin'. </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>Shaped like small silver slugs with a weight of between about 1 <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Monme (A Weight Unit in The Japanese Traditional System of Weights And Measures).html">monme</a> (approx. 3.75 g) to 10 <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Monme (A Weight Unit in The Japanese Traditional System of Weights And Measures).html">monme</a> (approx. 37.5 g), Mameitagin are silver coins that were valued by weight. There were also very small ones called Tsuyugin (dewdrop-beads) with a weight of 0.1 <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Monme (A Weight Unit in The Japanese Traditional System of Weights And Measures).html">monme</a> and used to adjust the weight. </p>
<p>Some of these coins had precise markings ('常是' [pronounced "joze"], which was the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Heredity.html">heredity</a> name of a refiner, and '寳' {pronounced "ho"], meaning "valuable") and the year they were made, while others were inscribed with the image of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Daikokuten.html">Daikokuten</a> (Great Black God) on one or both sides, probably to indicate that they were prizes or gifts. </p>
<p>They could be used on their own or in the role of auxiliary coins of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Chogin (Silver coins).html">Chogin</a> (coins in the form of long oval silver slugs). For example, Mameitagin were sometimes added to small <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Chogin (Silver coins).html">Chogin</a> to give a combined weight of 43 <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Monme (A Weight Unit in The Japanese Traditional System of Weights And Measures).html">monme</a> (approx. 161.25 g) and then wrapped in paper for use together. These are called Hogin (silver coin bags). <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Chogin (Silver coins).html">Chogin</a> were often used in the form of Hogin for large size transactions, but were hardly used on their own because they were too valuable to use in everyday life. Mameitagin were used widely, as they enabled each payment by weighing them with a portable Ginbakari (scale for silver) and were exchanged into silver coins at money changers as needed because they were easier to carry than cash in Zenisashi (a string to bundle coins). </p>
<p>Since Keicho Mameitagin around 1620, Mameitagin had been steadily minted in the same quality as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Chogin (Silver coins).html">Chogin</a> until Ansei Mameitagin in 1859 throughout the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Edo Period.html">Edo Period</a>. <h3>Types of Mameitagin</h3>
</p>
<p>The figures in brackets indicate the date of the mintage and silver content percentage (standards). The total amount of the mintage is included in that of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Chogin (Silver coins).html">Chogin</a>. </p>
