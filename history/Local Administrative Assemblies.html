<p>Local Administrative Assemblies was the assembly of prefectural governors summoned and established by the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> government in 1874. It was inspired by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Takayoshi KIDO.html">Takayoshi KIDO</a> in Osaka assembly and established. Prefectural governors gathered three times since 1875 to learn of the living conditions of people in district areas. They discussed about various matters of district administration related to the local assembly and three local new laws. It was the lower house of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Genroin (the Chamber of Elders).html">Genroin</a> (Japanese Senate) was actually the assembly of administrative official appointed by government. It was abolished in 1881 due to the imperial mandate for establishing a Diet. </p>
