<h1>Seiin (the Central State Council in the early Meiji period) (正院)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Seiin was the highest organ of Daijokan (Grand Council of State) system issued in 1871 after the Haihan-chiken (abolition of feudal domains and establishment of prefectures). </p>
<p>The traditional Daijokan was divided into three; Seiin, Sain (Council of the Left), and Uin (Council of the Right), and it took precedence over both the councils of Right and Left. The Seiin which attended to government affairs was equivalent to the traditional Daijokan and it consisted of Daijo-daijin (Grand Minister), Nagon (councilor), and Sangi (councillor). Afterwards, it was reformed in 1873, it had more authority and the responsibility for hohitsu (to make advices to the Emperor with full responsibility of the results) toward the Emperor was clarified. In 1875, although both councils of Right and Left were abolished, the Seiin was continued. In 1877, the Seiin was abolished. </p>
