<h1>Hagi-no-ran War (turmoil of dissatisfied warriors at Hagi) (萩の乱)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Hagi-no-ran War (turmoil of dissatisfied warriors at Hagi) was one of Shizoku no hanrans (rebellion by family or person with samurai ancestors) against Meiji government broke out in Hagi City, Yamaguchi Prefecture in 1876. </p>
<p>It was the rebellion led by Issei MAEBARA, a shizoku (family or person with samurai ancestors) from Yamaguchi Prefecture and the former Sangi (councilor), and Kensuke OKUDAIRA involving about 200 shizoku, which was raised in response to Shimpuren-no-ran War (turmoil of Shimpuren, dissatisfied warrior group) which broke out on October 24, 1876 in Kumamoto Prefecture and Akizuki-no-ran War (turmoil of Akizuki) on October 27th of the same year. </p>
<p>Summary<br/>
On October 28th, 'Junkoku Gun' (military of patriots willing to die for Japan) was raised, which was led by MAEBARA and was based in Meirinkan school (school of former feudal domain) in Hagi. However, Junkoku Gun was defeated by the government army lead by Goro MIURA by November 6th, being detected by the government and attacked by the Hiroshima Chindai (garrison in Meiji era) in Hagi. MEBARA, OKUDAIRA and other seven executive members went separate ways from the main force in an attempt to head for Tokyo by ship and left Hagi port, but were arrested on November 5th while they were casting an anchor at Uryu Port (located present-day Izumo City) because of the bad weather. </p>
<p>The court delivered sentence on people in conspiracy on December 3rd in Hagi, and MAEBARA and OKUDAIRA, who were thought to be ringleaders, were beheaded at once. </p>
<p>Bunnoshin TAMAKI (the uncle of Shoin YOSHIDA), the school master of Shokason Juku, committed suicide by disembowelment feeling guilty about his private school student, MEBARA's involvement in the conspiracy. </p>
