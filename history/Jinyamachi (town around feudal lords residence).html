<h1>Jinyamachi (town around feudal lord's residence) (陣屋町)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Jinyamachi was one of the former Japanese city forms. </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>Jinyamachi was formed around <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Jinya.html">jinya</a> (feudal lord's residence) in the feudal domain and chigyosho (sub-fief) or daikansho (district office) in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Tenryo (Shogunal Demesne).html">Tenryo</a> (shogunal lands) during the Edo period. Jinyamachi developed into a town as a number of bukeyashiki (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> mansions) stand and those engaged in commerce and industry gathered there to trade with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> and others who were working at the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Jinya.html">jinya</a>. </p>
<p>Since many of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Jokamachi.html">Jokamachi</a> (towns below the castle) in the Edo period had <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Hancho (domain office).html">hancho</a> (feudal lord's office) therein, those <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Jokamachi.html">Jokamachi</a> can be categorized as a kind of Jinyamachi in a wide sense. </p>
<p>In modern Japan, there were many districts that originated from Jinyamachi and some of their names included 'Jinyamachi' '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Jinya.html">jinya</a>' or the like, their rows of houses and buildings were conserved and protected, and they were considered tourist destinations. </p>
