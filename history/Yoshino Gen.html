<h1>Yoshino Gen (芳野監)</h1>
<p>Yoshino Gen was a special local administration division or organization established in the Yoshino area in Japan in the eighth century. It was included in the Kinai region. The territory was located in the southern part of Nara Prefecture. </p>
<p>History<br/>
</p>
<p>It was established by separating the Yoshino no kori (Yoshino district) of Yamato Province. The time of establishment was unknown, but it is thought to have been close to 716 in which Izumi Province was established. It is estimated that it became an organization named Gen, not ryoseikoku (province), because it had a role of managing the Yoshino no miya (Yoshino Palace) located there. Yoshino Gen was abolished sometime after 738. </p>
