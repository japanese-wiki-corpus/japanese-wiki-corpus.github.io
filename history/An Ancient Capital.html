<h1>An Ancient Capital (古都)</h1>
<p>An ancient capital can be defined as a place which has been the national capital since the ancient times or a place which was once the national capital city. </p>
<p>Many Japanese people refer to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Heian-kyo.html">Heian-kyo</a>) and Nara (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Heijo-kyo.html">Heijo-kyo</a>) as ancient capitals of Japan. In addition, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Asuka-mura (Asuka Village).html">Asuka-mura</a> (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Asuka-kyo (the Capital of Asuka).html">Asuka-kyo</a>), Osaka City (Naniwa-kyo) and Kobe City (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Fukuhara-kyo (Capital of Fukuhara).html">Fukuhara-kyo</a>) can be referred to as ancient capitals, since there were once Imperial residences in those areas in the ancient times. Though <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> cannot be referred to as an ancient capital when seen from the standpoint that 'an ancient capital' must be a place where Imperial residence existed, the Tokyo media often describe <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> as an ancient capital, since <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> was once a political center of the Kamakura Shogunate which held the reigns of government. It seems a definition of an ancient capital is not exact, because there is a tendency to call even old cities like Dazaifu and Hiraizumi, or so-called little <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> towns established in the medieval period, or castle towns of the early-modern times such as Kanazawa City and Matsue City with many historic sites as ancient capitals, though they had never been the center of national administration. </p>
<p>In any countries, many of ancient capitals (Gyeongju City, Xian City, Naples and Venice, and so on) have become today major tourist spots, for they have abundance of historic buildings. </p>
<p><h3>Ancient Capitals from a Legal <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Point (Sentoki).html">Point</a> of View</h3>
</p>
<p>According to 'Koto Hozon ho' (The Ancient Capitals Preservation Law,) it is the ordinance of local governments that designates a city or a town or a village as 'an ancient capital,' and once it was designated as 'an ancient capital' development is restricted in the specified area. Meanwhile, 'an ancient capital' under 'Koto Hozon ho' is a self-designated ancient capital and is not objectively confirmed. Not all cities designated as 'ancient capitals' under 'Koto Hozon ho' have old history or old townscapes. </p>
