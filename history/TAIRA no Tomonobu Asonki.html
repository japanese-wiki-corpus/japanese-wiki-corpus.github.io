<h1>TAIRA no Tomonobu Asonki (平知信朝臣記)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>"TAIRA no Tomonobu Asonki" is a diary written by TAIRA no Tomonobu who was a government official at the end of the Heian period. It has been also known as "Tomonobu-ki" or "Tomonobu-asonki." </p>
<p>The author, TAIRA no Tomonobu, was Jushiijo (Junior Fourth Rank, Upper Grade) governor of Dewa Province, and his family was Kanmu Heishi (Taira clan) TAIRA no Takamune-ryu (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/TAIRA no Takamune.html">TAIRA no Takamune</a> line). He was a practical government official who served as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Keishi (household superintendent).html">Keishi</a> (household superintendent) of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Tadazane.html">FUJIWARA no Tadazane</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Tadamichi.html">FUJIWARA no Tadamichi</a>. Accordingly, many descriptions of the sekkan-ke (the families which produced regents) in the cloister government period are seen. </p>
<p>In the Yomei-bunko library, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, two old manuscripts of April, 1127 to November, 1131 and April to May, 1132 (important cultural properties) and two newer manuscripts of January to March, 1132 and fall to winter, 1132 are exist. Moreover, one old manuscript of January to March, 1132 exists in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/school/Kyoto University.html">Kyoto University</a> library. These existing sections were written when TAIRA no Tomonobu was assigned as a lesser councilor of state after served as Hyobu shoyu (junior assistant minister of the Hyobusho Ministry of War) and Hyobu no Gon no Taifu (provisional senior assistant minister of Hyobusho Ministry of Military). At the same time, Tomonobu also served as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Keishi (household superintendent).html">Keishi</a> of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Tadazane.html">FUJIWARA no Tadazane</a> and his son Tadamichi. It has been a useful historical document for learning the movements of the sekkan-ke of the cloister government period since it has more detailed articles than the "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Chuyuki.html">Chuyuki</a>" (diary written by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Munetada.html">FUJIWARA no Munetada</a>) and "Choshuki" (diary of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Morotoki.html">MINAMOTO no Morotoki</a>). </p>
<p>Furthermore, "February, 1135 of Yorinaga Nintaisho-ki," which is a supplement of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Yorinaga.html">FUJIWARA no Yorinaga</a>'s diary "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Taiki.html">Taiki</a>," is actually this "TAIRA no Tomonobu Asonki." </p>
