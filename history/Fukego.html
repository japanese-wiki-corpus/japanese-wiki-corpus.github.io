<h1>Fukego (富家語)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Fukego or Fukegodan are the quotations from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Tadazane.html">FUJIWARA no Tadazane</a> (1078 - 1162), Kanpaku (chief adviser to the Emperor), otherwise known as Fuke-dono. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/TAKASHINA no Nakayuki.html">TAKASHINA no Nakayuki</a> transcribed it. Fukego is sometimes classified as a setsuwa (a collection of anecdotes) because it was written in the earlier period, in the times under cloistered rule, and presented such subjects as yusoku-kojitsu (knowledge of court rules, ceremony, decorum and records of the past) and official court events to setsuwa collections of the later period. </p>
<p>It contains 258 brief articles from 1151 to 1161, from articles which are included in "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Chugaisho.html">Chugaisho</a>," Tadazane's discourse collection, to articles after the Hogen and Heiji Disturbances. Different from "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Chugaisho.html">Chugaisho</a>," it has no date entry but the discourse might have been given in Tadazane's later years when he was confined in Chisoku-in Temple at the foot of Mt. Funaoka on the charge of being implicated in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Hogen Disturbance (Hogen-no-ran).html">Hogen Disturbance</a>. </p>
<p>It is included in the volume which is entitled "Godansho Chugaisho Fukego" of 'Nihon koten bungaku taikei' (Japanese Classic Literature Systematic Edition) (the publisher is Iwanami Shoten). </p>
