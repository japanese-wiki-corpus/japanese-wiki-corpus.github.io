<h1>Gakkanin (学館院)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Gakkanin is a type of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Daigaku-besso.html">Daigaku-besso</a> (academic facility for nobles) that belongs to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Daigaku-ryo.html">Daigaku-ryo</a> (Bureau of Education under the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ritsuryo.html">ritsuryo</a> system). </p>
<p>It is expressed with a different set of Chinese characters in "Nihon montoku tenno jitsuroku" (5th national history, covering the years 850-858) and with another different set of Chinese characters in "Irohajirui-sho" (a dictionary written by Tadakane TACHIBANA in the Heian period). </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>Gakkanin was established in 847 by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/TACHIBANA no Kachiko.html">TACHIBANA no Kachiko</a>, who was the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Grand Empress Dowager.html">Grand Empress Dowager</a> of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Saga.html">Emperor Saga</a>, and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Sadaijin (Minister of the Left).html">Sadaijin</a> (minister of the left) <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/TACHIBANA no Ujikimi.html">TACHIBANA no Ujikimi</a>, and it was officially recognized as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Daigaku-besso.html">Daigaku-besso</a> in 964. However, it grew weak because the financial base of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Daigaku-besso.html">Daigaku-besso</a> was weak to start with and also because the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/family/Tachibana clan.html">Tachibana clan</a> fell from power. </p>
<p>It was however taken over by the Fujiwara clan, the relatives of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/family/Tachibana clan.html">Tachibana clan</a>, as Zejo (the title of the chieftain of a clan especially the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/family/Tachibana clan.html">Tachibana clan</a> and the O clan). Although it was already ruined by the 12th century, affiliated private estates and the chihokan (local official) recommendation (nenkyo) system remained up to the Middle Ages, and also, the title Gakkanin-betto (the chief officer of Gakkanin) also remained to indicate an honorary position. </p>
