<h1>Civilization and Enlightenment of Japan (文明開化)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The civilization and enlightenment occurred during the transitional phase of Japan in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period, seeing drastic changes in various systems, organizations and cultural customs of Japan as the results of the Westernization. While modernization = Westernization was the fundamental issue throughout <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period, the term Civilization and Enlightenment is generally applied to the conditions seen in early <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period, when the social conditions and customs of people dramatically changed from the former feudalistic society. </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>The civilization and enlightenment is the phenomenon of absorption and intake of Western civilization flew into Japan in parallel with the renovation of political system, during the time when the strongly feudalistic Japanese culture that had been unbrokenly continued throughout the Edo period was coming to the limits due to the isolationism and the like. The term "文明開化" (civilization and enlightenment) was used by <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Yukichi FUKUZAWA (educator).html">Yukichi FUKUZAWA</a> for the first time in his essay published in 1875, "<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Bunmeiron no gairyaku (An Outline of a Theory of Civilization).html">Bunmeiron no gairyaku</a>" (An Outline of a Theory of Civilization) as the translation of the word, civilization. There were wide variety of ways how the movement took shapes within Japanese society, from the simple imitation of Western culture and customs, to the absorption of those elements as the model cases for fusing with traditional Japanese culture, or rearranging the traditional Japanese culture into Western styles; the movement became an enthusiastic trend during this transitional phase, received by wide variety of people among different social levels. </p>
<p>There was a well-known phrase describing the period, saying that "Zangiri atama wo tataite mireba, Bunmei Kaika no otogasuru," ("Knocking on the short-cut hair by removing a topknot, we can hear the sound of civilization") which became the origin of the movement to produce a new style in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Kabuki.html">Kabuki</a> theatrical play called "Zangiri-mono." In "Agra Nabe" (which means, sitting cross-legged around hot pot, eat food and talk frankly) written by Robun KANAGAKI, he said, "you are a dinosaur not eating beef hot pot!" which satirically describe the changing cultural habit of Japanese people even among the general public. </p>
<p>The new <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> government promoted the policies of industrial development, wealth and military strength of Japan, leaving Asia and entering Europe, while the government also promoted the adaptation of Western culture and customs, such as Western-style architecture, (=>Western style building and pseudo Western style architecture) short-cut hair removing the topknot of a man, Western style clothing, and Western style food and cooking. However, studies also suggest that such Westernization and the actual adaptation of those styles and customs was limited to the people living in the urban areas or among those educated classes. In rural conditions of local towns and villages, the transition of the lifestyle was much more gradual and slow as the tradition and customs of the late Edo period lasted far longer; people in some area used paper-shaded lamp using rapeseed oil until the beginning of Showa period, and the benefit of those new Western systems such as a new postal service and telegraph communication were not effectively introduced and utilized until much later years. Yet still, the Prefectural offices in local regions led the exclusion of a traditional culture and customs upon the policy of the new <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> government, therefore there are many traditions and customs curtailed and vanished under the civilization process. </p>
<p>The rapid and drastic Westernization was promoted also because of the notion of impending crisis, by seeing the act of the Great Powers of the West exploiting Asian countries to acquire a vast wealth through the management of colonized countries. As the principal part of the wealth and the military strength policy, the introduction and adaptation of Western-style military technologies and skills was strongly promoted; even the food service provided in the military (military ration) was Westernized in order to strengthen the physical power and stamina of soldiers. The early stage of Japanese military was formed by the group of young people composed of the second or third sons collected from rural and agricultural regions; they had grown up by eating traditional Japanese food with rice-centered diet, thus some could not easily accept such Western style dishes so different from their eating habit. In Navy, various cares were taken for the food service by inventing and arranging the Western dishes for the taste of Japanese people; for example, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Curry.html">curry</a> dish was provided with Japanese rice; an eclectic dish such as the meat and potato pot dish in soy sauce taste was invented. This curried rice was introduced to public as "Navy <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Curry.html">curry</a>," and the meat and potato pot dish was also widely accepted by people outside of Navy. Later in Showa period, those dishes became widely popular as family dishes. <h3>Evidences of Civilization and Enlightenment</h3>
