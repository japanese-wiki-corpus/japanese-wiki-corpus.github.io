<h1>Yamaga Domain (山家藩)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Yamaga Domain included the areas in and around Yamaga in Ikaruga no kori (Ikaruga County), <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Tanba Province.html">Tanba Province</a> as its territory. The government building for the domain was called Yamaga <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Jinya.html">Jinya</a> (now in Hirose-cho, Ayabe City, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>). The Tani family, which governed the domain, had a close relationship with the Imperial Family through their connection with the Sono family, in fact, today's Imperial family members are related to the Tani family. </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Moritomo TANI.html">Moritomo TANI</a>, the first lord of the Yamaga Domain, was a military commander (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a>) who served <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Nobunaga ODA.html">Nobunaga ODA</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI.html">Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI</a>, and controlled land worth 16,000 koku in Yamaga, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Tanba Province.html">Tanba Province</a>. </p>
<p>During the Battle of Sekigahara (1600), Moritomo, together with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Shigekatsu ONOGI.html">Shigekatsu ONOGI</a>, joined the Western Camp as it besieged <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Tanabe-jo Castle (Tango Province).html">Tanabe-jo Castle</a> in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Tango Province.html">Tango Province</a>, owned by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yusai HOSOKAWA.html">Yusai HOSOKAWA</a> who belonged to the Eastern Camp. However, as Moritomo was constrained to join the Western Camp, and also because he had a secret connection with Fujitaka HOSOKAWA who was his master in waka poetry, he was permitted to retain his territory by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Ieyasu TOKUGAWA.html">Ieyasu TOKUGAWA</a> after the battle. </p>
<p>The Yamaga Domain was controlled by the Tani family until its thirteenth generation during the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period. During the time of Morimasa TANI, the second head of the family, the Yamaga Domain subdivided the territory worth 1,500 koku to Morifuyu TANI (the younger brother; the Umezako Tani family), territory worth 2,500 koku to Moriyuki TANI (the nephew; the Uesugi Tani family), and territory worth 2,000 koku to Morikiyo TANI (the nephew in the Tokura Tani family) as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Hatamoto (direct retainers of shogun).html">hatamoto</a> (direct retainers of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>). As a result, the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kokudaka (The Figure Of Land Productivity).html">kokudaka</a> (crop yield) of Yamaga Domain became 10,000 koku. </p>
<p>During the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Meiji Restoration (Meiji-ishin).html">Meiji Restoration</a>, the Yamaga Domain was one of the first to pronounce its obedience to the new government. At the time of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Haihan-chiken (abolition of feudal domains and establishment of prefectures).html">Haihan-chiken</a> (the abolition of feudal domains and the establishment of prefectures) of 1871, it became Yamaga Prefecture, which later became a part of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>. In 1887, the Tani family were bestowed the title of viscount and was raised to peerage. </p>
