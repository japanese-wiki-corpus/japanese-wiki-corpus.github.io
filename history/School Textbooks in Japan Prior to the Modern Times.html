<h1>School Textbooks in Japan Prior to the Modern Times (近代以前の日本における教科書)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>This article will explain about the history of the school textbooks in Japan until the school system was established in the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period. </p>
<p><h3>Ancient Times</h3>
</p>
<p>According to the history books, "<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Kojiki (The Records of Ancient Matters).html">Kojiki</a>" (Record of Ancient Matters) and "<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan).html">Nihonshoki</a>" (The Chronicles of Japan), Wani is believed to be a teacher to the Prince of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Ojin.html">Emperor Ojin</a> using the books "Rongo" (The Analects of Confucius) and "Senjimon" (The Thousand Character Classic); however, this remains unconfirmed. Also, it is said that <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/FUJIWARA no Kamatari.html">FUJIWARA no Kamatari</a> was taught on "Shueki" (Classic of Changes) by the monk Min just before the Taika Reforms, and also attended the private school of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/MINABUCHI no Shoan.html">MINABUCHI no Shoan</a>, bringing the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Tenchi (Tenji).html">Emperor Tenchi</a> along with him. </p>
<p>It is said that the oldest full-fledged educational institution was the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Daigaku-ryo.html">Daigaku-ryo</a> within the Centralized Administration established under the Ritsuryo Legal Codes, and according to the regulations, in the regular course (later known as <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Myogyodo.html">Myogyodo</a>), "Rongo" and "<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/building/Kokyo.html">Kokyo</a>" (Classic of Filial Piety) of Confucianism were compulsory and specializations were determined based on the combination scriptures from the three scripture groups: the large scriptures, which included "Raiki" and "Shunju Sashiden," the medium scriptures, which included "Moshi," "Shurai" and "Girai" and the small scriptures, which included "Shueki" and "Shosho." Also, each of the scriptures had annotations written by specific authors, such as Gen TEI and Hitsu O for "Shueki," Ankoku KO and Gen TEI for "Shosho" and "<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/building/Kokyo.html">Kokyo</a>," Gen TEI for "Shurai," "Girai," "Raiki" and "Moshi," Ken FUKU and Yo TO for "Shunju Sashiden," Gen TEI and An KA for "Rongo." When IYOBE no Iemori came back from Tang (China) in 776, he brought with him the annotations of two books, "Shunju Kuyoden" and "Shunju Kokuyoden," which were added to the small scriptures in 798. In 860, "Gyochu <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/building/Kokyo.html">Kokyo</a>" (Kaigan Shichu), an annotation text written by Ryuki LI was adopted for the annotation of "<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/building/Kokyo.html">Kokyo</a>" by the advice of OKASUGA no Otsugu (however, the study of those of Ankoku KO were not restricted in any way). In the "<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Shinto/Engishiki.html">Engishiki</a>" system of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Daigaku-ryo.html">Daigaku-ryo</a>, among the nine small scripture textbooks of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Sando.html">Sando</a> (Mathematics), which included "Sonshi Sankyo," "Goso Sankyo," "Kyusho Sanjutsu," "Kaito Sankei," "Rokusho," "Teijutsu," "Sankai Jusa," "Shuhi Sankei," "Kyushi," three were compulsory, "Kyusho Sanjutsu," "Rokusho," and "Teijutsu" with "Shuhi Sankei" added later to the compulsory list of textbooks. As for Myobodo (Law) and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Kidendo.html">Kidendo</a> (History), which were most likely established during the Jinki and Tenpyo periods, the former adopted the Ritsuryo Legal Codes itself as a textbook, and in the "<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Shinto/Engishiki.html">Engishiki</a>," 'Ritsu' was included in the medium scriptures and 'Ryo' in the small scriptures. And the latter adopted "Monzen" and "Jiga" at first, but in the "<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Shinto/Engishiki.html">Engishiki</a>," '<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Sanshi (a government post).html">Sanshi</a>' (three history books) ("<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shiki (a rank in government offices under ritsuryo system).html">Shiki</a>," "<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Kanjo.html">Kanjo</a>," and "Gokanjo") were adopted in place of "Jiga" and all were categorized as large scriptures. </p>
<p>One's success in the aristocratic society largely depended on systems such as the Oni, the Otoneri, and the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Udoneri (government post).html">Udoneri</a>, which took your bloodline into account, and the children of powerful aristocrats were educated mainly at home, except during a short period in the early Heian period when such children were obliged to study in the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Daigaku-ryo.html">Daigaku-ryo</a>. For children's education, "Mogyu," "Senjimon" and "Rikyo Hyakunijuei" were primarily used, with "Wakan Roeishu" written by <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/FUJIWARA no Kinto.html">FUJIWARA no Kinto</a>, "Sakumon Daitai" written by <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/FUJIWARA no Munetada.html">FUJIWARA no Munetada</a>, "Zoku Senjimon" and "Domoshoin" written by MIOSHI no Tameyasu later added to the list of textbooks. However, all the textbooks were about Chinese classics and Chinese poetry of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Kidendo.html">Kidendo</a> (History), which was the main discipline at that time. The reciting of the scriptures of Confucianism was also believed to have been taught. When children reached the age of 7 or 8, or the age of 13 or 14 (depending on the era), the Ceremony of First Reading were held, and they began reading books such as "Gyochu <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/building/Kokyo.html">Kokyo</a>" and "<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shiki (a rank in government offices under ritsuryo system).html">Shiki</a>." Emperors upon reaching adulthood were appointed Professors of Monjodo (Department of Chinese poetry and history), and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Regent.html">regent</a> families to an emperor were appointed famous scholars as <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Keishi (household superintendent).html">Keishi</a> to work as court scholars. The textbooks used were same as those used at <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Myogyodo.html">Myogyodo</a> and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Kidendo.html">Kidendo</a> of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Daigaku-ryo.html">Daigaku-ryo</a>, but additional lectures were also given on "Gunsyochiyo," "Roshi Dotokukyo," "Soshi," "Hakushimonju," "Joganseiyo," "Sesetsushingo," etc. There were also books created for particular people such as "Togusetsuin" (Dissipation) offered to the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Montoku.html">Emperor Montoku</a> during his crown prince days by <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/SUGAWARA no Koreyoshi.html">SUGAWARA no Koreyoshi</a>, "<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Wamyo Ruijusho.html">Wamyo Ruijusho</a>" offered to Imperial Princess Isoko by <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/MINAMOTO no Shitago.html">MINAMOTO no Shitago</a>, "Sambo Ekotoba" offered to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Imperial Princess Sonshi.html">Imperial Princess Sonshi</a> by <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/MINAMOTO no Tamenori.html">MINAMOTO no Tamenori</a>, and "Kuchizusami" offered to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/FUJIWARA no Sanenobu.html">FUJIWARA no Sanenobu</a> also by <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/MINAMOTO no Tamenori.html">MINAMOTO no Tamenori</a>. During the late Heian period, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/FUJIWARA no Akihira.html">FUJIWARA no Akihira</a> authored "Unshushosoku," which is believed to be the oldest <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Oraimono.html">Oraimono</a> (a textbook for primary education) in Japan, for court nobles to refer to when they prepared documents. <h3>Medieval Period</h3>
</p>
<p>During the Medieval period, education was increasingly offered in temples, and samurais as well as common people were able to send their children tom temples to receive their education. Books like "Dojikyo" and "<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Jitsugokyo.html">Jitsugokyo</a>" were originally used for textbooks, but eventually most textbooks were replaced with <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Oraimono.html">Oraimono</a>. Originally, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Oraimono.html">Oraimono</a> was a collection of model sentences for letter-writing, but later it developed to include social knowledge and common sense, and by the period of the Northern and Southern Courts, "<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Teikin Orai.html">Teikin Orai</a>" was created. <h3>Pre-Modern Times</h3>
</p>
<p>After the Shogunate system with clans was well established during the Edo period, the Zhu Xi school of Neo-Confucianism took a central role in education, and education focused mainly on Chinese classics such as Scriptures of Confucianism, History, and Literature, with Calligraphy and Mathematics taking on a supplemental role. </p>
<p>Private elementary schools for the common people adopted for their textbooks like <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Oraimono.html">Oraimono</a>, which included "<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Teikin Orai.html">Teikin Orai</a>," as well as "Dojikyo," "<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Jitsugokyo.html">Jitsugokyo</a>," "Joeishikimoku," and other books related Confucianism such as "Sanjikyo," "Yamato Shogaku," "<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/building/Kokyo.html">Kokyo</a>," "Shogaku," etc. </p>
<p>With the rising of the standard of learning on ancient Japanese thought and culture during the latter period of the Tokugawa Shogunate, books such as "<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Nihon Gaishi (historical book on Japan).html">Nihon Gaishi</a>," "Nihon Seiki," and "Kokushiryaku," which increased the reverence for the Emperor, were adopted in the schools of the clans and in some of the private elementary schools for the common people. </p>
