One-yen coin (一円硬貨)
<div class="fb-like" style="display: inline;" data-href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/One-yen coin.html" data-width="" data-layout="button_count" data-action="like" data-size="small" data-share="true"></div>
</h1>

<p></p>
<p>The one-yen coin is a subsidiary coin issued by the Japanese government. It is called 'ichi en koka' or 'ichi en dama' in Japanese. It has the highest mintage of any current coin. </p>
<p>On the head side are the designs for 'Japan', 'one yen' (both in kanji) and a sapling, while on the tail side is the number 'one' and the year of mintage. </p>
<p>In 1954, one year before it was issued, designs for this one-yen coin and (former) 50-yen coin were sought from the public for the first time after the war. During the 40-day period of public appeal, there were 2,581 applications for the one-yen coin alone. The sapling on the head side was designed by Masami NAKAMURA who lived in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a> at the time, and the number '1' on the tail side was designed by Toshio TAKASHIMA who lived in Osaka Prefecture at the time. </p>
<p>There was no specific model for the sapling design, instead the concept is that, because there is no particular model, it can be related to any tree. </p>
<p>Before the consumption tax was introduced, the coins were sparsely used in supermarkets etc., however, after the tax was introduced, the supply significantly increased as well as that of five-yen coins, so they began to be minted in high volume especially during the Heisei period. Since 1997, when the consumption tax was increased from 3% to 5%, however, their need has decreased and so has their mintage. Especially in 2001, only about 8 million coins were minted, so coins manufactured in that year are traded at relatively high prices (compared to their face value) in old coin shops etc. </p>
<p>It is well known that the cost to mint a one-yen coin is higher than one yen, and the more they mint, the more money they lose. </p>
<p>The cost of the raw material, aluminum, alone is about 0.7 yen, and it is said that the cost is around 1.6 - 1.8 yen to finish manufacturing a one-yen coin. Currently, it is said the cost to mint one coin is two yen. </p>
<p><h3>Transition</h3>
</p>
<p>1870: Former one-yen silver coin was issued. </p>
<p>1871: Former one-yen gold coin (standard gold coin) was issued. </p>
<p>1874: New one-yen silver coin was issued. </p>
<p>1948: One-yen brass coin was issued. This one-yen brass coin was issued after the war, but because there was a risk that the coins may be melted due to an increase in price for the raw metal, production was ceased. </p>
<p>1955: Current one-yen aluminum coin was issued. </p>
<p>1968: Issuance was stopped for one year. Therefore, there are no one-yen coins on which 'Showa 43' is incused. </p>
