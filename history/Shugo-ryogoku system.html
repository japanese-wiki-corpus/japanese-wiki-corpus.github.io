<p>The shugo-ryogoku system (the system that a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a> [a provincial military governor] dominates a territory) is a historical concept indicating a comprehensive control system of a territory by the shugo-daimyo (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a> that became <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a>, Japanese feudal lords) in the Muromachi period. </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a> in the Muromachi period were initially (around the mid 14th century) appointed by the Muromachi <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>) once in several years, which resulted in the comparatively frequent alternation of the shugo-shiki (the post of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a>). However, in around the end of the 14th century, the shugo-shiki was exclusively possessed by a certain clan that inherited the post of its province, which was called "<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Monopolization.html">monopolization</a> of the shugo-shiki." In addition, in the same period, the shugo-shiki came to assume a wide spectrum of authority ranging from military and police authority to the authority for gaining an economical profit, such as the authority to make an investigation and give instruction (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kendan-sata (criminal cases).html">kendan-sata</a>) over three kinds of criminal cases (Taibon-sankajo, three major tasks for peacekeeping), the authority to investigate the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Karita-rozeki.html">karita-rozeki</a> (to reap rice illegally), the authority to pass delegation of the word, the authority to collect half of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Nengu (Land Tax).html">nengu</a> (land tax), the authority to provide confiscated land or land without a governor (called kessho-chi), as well as the authority to collect tan-sen (surtax on the rice fields) and munabechi-sen (surtax on the houses). Compared with the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a> in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period, whose authority was limited to military and police authority relating to Taibon-sankajo, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Obanyaku.html">Obanyaku</a> (a job to guard <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>), etc., the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a> in the Muromachi period had drastically expanded authority. To distinguish these two <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a>, the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a> in the Muromachi period is specifically called "shugo-daimyo." </p>
<p>Thus, taking advantage of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Monopolization.html">monopolization</a> of the shugo-shiki as well as the drastically expanded authority, the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a> in the Muromachi period strengthened the comprehensive (unified) control over the resident landholders (called "<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kokujin.html">kokujin</a>" [local lord]), lands, people (including peasants) and so on. <h3>The control over <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> (manor) and koryo (public land)</h3>
</p>
<p>Wielding authorities such as the authority to collect half of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Nengu (Land Tax).html">nengu</a> as well as the authority to collect tan-sen, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a> gradually encroached upon <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> and territories governed by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kokuga (provincial government office compounds).html">kokuga</a> (provincial government office) within their territories. Hanzei-rei (literally, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Hanzei (Half Payment of Taxes).html">Hanzei</a> law) issued in the Oan era in the end of 14th century provided <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a> with the authority to confiscate half of the land. Moreover, making a contract with the landholders of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> and the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kokushi.html">kokushi</a> (provincial governors) to pay them <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Nengu (Land Tax).html">nengu</a> from income, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a> virtually dominated the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> and the territories of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kokuga (provincial government office compounds).html">kokuga</a>, which were called "shugo-uke" (the work undertaken by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a>). Thereby, requesting the right to appropriate the land (called Shitaji-shinshi-ken or Tochi-shihai-ken [land ruling right]) of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> and the territories of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kokuga (provincial government office compounds).html">kokuga</a> nationwide, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a> gradually attained land. However, as these pushes made by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a> caused severe friction with the interests of the landholders of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a>, some landholders attained the right of shugo-funyu (privilege of forbidding <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a> or its agent from entering the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a>) by appealing to the Imperial Court and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>, confronting the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a>. <h3>The control over <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kokuga (provincial government office compounds).html">kokuga</a></h3>
</p>
<p><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a> started to expand their influence on the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kokuga (provincial government office compounds).html">kokuga</a> government as well as control over the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kokuga (provincial government office compounds).html">kokuga</a>'s territories, compelling <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Zaichokanjin.html">zaichokanjin</a> (the local officials in Heian and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> periods) to obey as the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Hikan (low ranking clerks).html">hikan</a> (low-level bureaucrat, namely vassal), which was called "Hikanization." At the same time, dominating the territories of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kokuga (provincial government office compounds).html">kokuga</a> and those of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Zaichokanjin.html">zaichokanjin</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a> formed direct control territory called shugo-ryo (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a>'s territory). <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a>'s control over <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kokuga (provincial government office compounds).html">kokuga</a> was so remarkable in Togoku (the eastern part of Japan, particularly the Kanto region) that <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a> had almost finished gaining control over the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kokuga (provincial government office compounds).html">kokuga</a> by the beginning of the 15th century. On the other hand, in Saigoku (the western part of Japan, particularly Kyushu region, but ranging as far east as Kinki), the Imperial household, kuge (court nobles), and temples and shrines that had a title to the territories of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kokuga (provincial government office compounds).html">kokuga</a> had invariably maintained a strong influence, which restrained <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a> from interfering in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kokuga (provincial government office compounds).html">kokuga</a> too much. However, through the implementation of "shugo-uke" and "Hikanization" of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Zaichokanjin.html">zaichokanjin</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a> came to control the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kokuga (provincial government office compounds).html">kokuga</a> effectively in the beginning of the 15th century. Thus, the authority of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kokushi.html">kokushi</a>, which had been maintained since the enforcement of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Ritsuryo.html">Ritsuryo</a> system (a system of centralized government based on the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Ritsuryo.html">ritsuryo</a> code), disappeared both in name and reality in the Muromachi period. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a> that had controlled the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kokuga (provincial government office compounds).html">kokuga</a> governed their territories on the basis of Ota bumi (cadastre), a basic material for the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kokuga (provincial government office compounds).html">kokuga</a> government. In the Ota bumi, details of domestic territories of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kokuga (provincial government office compounds).html">kokuga</a> (or <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Kuden (oral instruction).html">kuden</a> [field administered directly by a ruler]) including a part of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> were recorded. The Ota bumi enabled <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a> to strengthen the control over the territories of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kokuga (provincial government office compounds).html">kokuga</a> and the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a>, which resulted in the further dissolution and collapse of the shoen-koryo-sei (the system of public lands and private estates). <h3>The control over <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kokujin.html">kokujin</a></h3>
</p>
<p>The resident landholder stratum, including the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> stratum originated from jito (manager and lord of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a>) in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period, was called "<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kokujin.html">kokujin</a>" in the Muromachi period. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a> tried to control the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kokujin.html">kokujin</a> stratum including the aforementioned <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Zaichokanjin.html">zaichokanjin</a> in their territories by using the method of "Hikanization." Many <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kokujin.html">kokujin</a> became <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Hikan (low ranking clerks).html">hikan</a>, who formed the vassals belonging to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a>. However, not a few <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kokujin.html">kokujin</a> organized the Kokujin-ikki (union) in cooperation with the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Myoshu.html">myoshu</a> (owner of rice fields) stratum immersed in farm management, peasants and others, in an attempt to keep individuality. Especially, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kokujin.html">kokujin</a> in the Kinai region (provinces surrounding <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and Nara) had quite a strong inclination for independence, which was exemplified by the case that the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a> (the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/family/Hosokawa clan.html">Hosokawa clan</a>) failed to achieve the "Hikanization" of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kokujin.html">kokujin</a> in Yamashiro Province, Tamba Province and other provinces despite having spent several decades. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a> carried out "Hikanization" by providing the vassalized <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kokujin.html">kokujin</a> and others with territory and the privilege of collecting taxes and so on. It means that <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kokujin.html">kokujin</a> and others were provided kyubun-den (bonus rice field) from <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a> besides their territories. Concerning the military service assigned to the vassalized <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kokujin.html">kokujin</a>, there were several cases that the service was imposed considering the scale of territory and kyubun (bonus), which suggests that the control over the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kokujin.html">kokujin</a> had not yet been unified. </p>
<p>Most <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a> were permanently stationed in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> or <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> as key members of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>, leaving the actual territory management to the shugo-dai (deputy of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a>), who were selected from vassals under the direct supervision of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a> and the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kokujin.html">kokujin</a> stratum. With unrest spreading over the ruling system of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> in the period of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Onin War.html">Onin War</a> to the Meio Coup in the late 15th century, some shugo-dai and influential <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kokujin.html">kokujin</a> held real power in ruling the territories instead of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a>. <h3>The control over people</h3>
</p>
<p><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a> controlled people nationwide by uniformly imposing taxes and duties such as tan-sen and munabechi-sen as well as shugo-yaku (service duty under <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a>) on them. Tan-sen and munabechi-sen were originally accounted among land taxes uniformly imposed on people nationwide, which were collected by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a> under the instruction of the Imperial Court and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> aiming at raising extra money. However, those taxes were later changed to shugo-tansen, the tan-sen imposed by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a> in their own right. Meanwhile, shugo-yaku meant various duties imposed on peasants in the territory by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a> in their own rights, most of which were performed by bu-yaku (labor service). The shugo-yaku was often imposed on each village as a unit. </p>
<p>In the Muromachi period, people formed various unions including Kokujin-ikki (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kokujin.html">kokujin</a> ryoshu [local <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> lord] union) formed by the people in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kokujin.html">kokujin</a> stratum, as well as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Soson (a community comprising a self-governing association of peasants).html">soson</a> (a community consisting of peasants' self-governing association) and goson (autonomous village) formed by peasants living in villages. While all of the unions were controlled by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a> on the one hand, they were allowed to be independent to some extent on the other hand. The control over people was not always strict in the shugo-ryogoku system, but it became stricter with the times. <h3>Change to the daimyo-ryogoku system (the system that <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> control feudal domains)</h3>
</p>
<p>The shugo-ryogoku system was epoch-making in that it promoted comprehensive control, compared with the conventional ruling system under <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> families. However, as mentioned above, the shugo-ryogoku system did not always control strictly the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kokujin.html">kokujin</a> stratum and the peasant stratum. With the social system becoming remarkably unstable in the end of the 15th century, it became necessary to apply stricter control system to territories. Denying various disadvantageous terms such as the right of shugo-funyu, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a> that had successfully coped with these changes, as well as shugo-dai and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kokujin.html">kokujin</a> that had ousted <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a>, grew into Sengoku <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> (Japanese territorial lord in the Sengoku period [period of warring states]) controlling their territories strongly and uniformly. On the other hand, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a> that had failed to cope with these changes went to ruin. With the appearance of the Sengoku <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a>, the shugo-ryogoku system, for which the existence of shugo-daimyo was prerequisite, was changed and dissolved in fact, replaced with the system called "daimyo-ryogoku sei" (daimyo-ryogoku system). </p>
