<h1>Tochokufu (official document to enforce the Emperor's order) (騰勅符)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Tochokufu refers to a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Daijokanpu.html">Daijokanpu</a> (the official documents of the Daijokan, the office of the supreme political leader) to deliver and enforce the order of the Emperor. To (謄)' means to deliver a message by post horse. The copied ('謄') tochokufu that the chokushi (imperial order) is transcribed to a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Daijokanpu.html">Daijokanpu</a> without change is also a part of the tochokufu, and they are often mixed up. </p>
<p>It was formerly considered that tochokufu was created to deliver the chokushi (imperial order) to the officials staying outside of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, according to the interpretation of the Kushiki-ryo (law on state documentary forms in the Yoro Code) (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ritsuryo.html">Ritsuryo</a> law). However, the recent study shows that all the orders issued by the Emperor including <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Mikotonori.html">mikotonori</a> (imperial decree) and Daijokanso (report to the emperor from Daijokan) were subject of study as needed, and that it was also issued to the officials staying in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. </p>
