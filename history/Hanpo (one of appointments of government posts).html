<h1>Hanpo (one of appointments of government posts) (判補)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Hanpo refers to one of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bunin (appointment).html">Bunin</a> (appointments of government posts) in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ritsuryo.html">ritsuryo</a> system (a system of centralized government based on the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ritsuryo.html">ritsuryo</a> code). It was subordinated to Chokunin (imperial <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Appointment (Ninkan).html">appointment</a>), Sonin (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Appointment (Ninkan).html">appointment</a> by Dajokan [Grand Council of State] upon imperial approval) and Hannin (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Appointment (Ninkan).html">appointment</a> by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shikibu-sho.html">Shikibu-sho</a> [the Ministry of Ceremonial] upon approval of Dajokan), and was mainly used when conducting <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bunin (appointment).html">Bunin</a> for Zonin (lower-ranking government official). </p>
<p>The <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Appointment (Ninkan).html">appointment</a> was made by Dajokan upon selection by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shikibu-sho.html">Shikibu-sho</a> or Hyobu-sho (the Ministry of Military), but the ministry substantially held the appointing power, and furthermore, it is considered that the selection was conducted in consideration of an intention of government official who would supervise a government post to subject to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bunin (appointment).html">Bunin</a>. </p>
<p>Targeted officers were Bunbankan (officers subject to shiftwork) whose rank was equivalent to Mui (no rank) or Shoi (Initial Rank) such as Toneri (palace servant), Shisho (people who performed miscellaneous duties about documents), Shibu (low rank bureaucrats), Tomo no miyatsuko (servant of the court administering a group), Chonai (lower-rank officers provided to imperial princes or princesses in order to guard them and/or perform miscellaneous services), Shijin (lower-rank officers provided to vassals in order to guard them and/or perform miscellaneous services) and so on. </p>
