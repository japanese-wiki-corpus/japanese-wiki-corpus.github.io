<h1>Omote-daka (face value of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kokudaka (The Figure Of Land Productivity).html">kokudaka</a> assessed by the feudal government) (表高)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Omotedaka refers to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kokudaka (The Figure Of Land Productivity).html">kokudaka</a> (yield) on face value of shoryo (territory) that was given by seii taishogun (literally, "great general who subdues the barbarians") to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> (feudal lords) or <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Hatamoto (direct retainers of shogun).html">hatamoto</a> (direct retainers) in the Edo period. </p>
<p>Omotedaka refers to, in many cases, the face value of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kokudaka (The Figure Of Land Productivity).html">kokudaka</a> figured out from land survey certified by the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Edo bakufu.html">Edo bakufu</a>, and it was written, along with the name of the territory, in shuinjo (a vermillion seal letter) of shoryo ando (act of providing authorization for land ownership and guaranteeing feudal tenure) issued by the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>, who was also lord, to a new owner every replacement. Also, it served as estimation standard to determine social status of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Hatamoto (direct retainers of shogun).html">hatamoto</a>, or military service to be borne such as tetsudai-fushin (construction service which the cost was borne by each domain) or sankinkotai. </p>
<p>Against Omotedaka, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kokudaka (The Figure Of Land Productivity).html">kokudaka</a> that was actually used to estimate <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Nengu (Land Tax).html">nengu</a> imposed to ryomin (people of the domain) was called uchidaka (real value of the yield). </p>
<p>Omotedaka was, most of the time, being used without change from the early Edo period when it had been fixed, so many domains actually held larger uchidaka than omotedaka due to development of new rice fields. </p>
