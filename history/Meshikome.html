<h1>Meshikome (召籠)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Meshikome was one of the punishments given out to courtiers in the Heian Period. </p>
<p>Summary<br/>
If court staff or officers neglected their duties or made a mistake, they were held at the entrance of the court or guard offices. </p>
<p>Peeping during the Jimoku (ceremony for appointing officials), opening the Gosechi chodai and looking at the Gosechi princesses at the Gosechi no mai Dance (dance performance as part of a harvest festival), being late or absent from various chogi (ceremony at Imperial Court), or making mistakes when officially relaying documents were all activities that led to Meshikome. </p>
<p>Those who were under Meshikome were prohibited from visiting the emperor, eating or following and attending any official events. </p>
