<h1><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kusarigama (a chain and a sickle).html">Kusarigama</a> jutsu (art of Japanese chain and sickle) (鎖鎌術)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The term '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kusarigama (a chain and a sickle).html">Kusarigama</a> jutsu' refers to a martial art in which a fighter, holding a sickle on a chain in one hand and the chain with a iron weight in the other, and swinging the weight in a circular motion, could throw the iron weight to the opponent's body or use the chain to entangle the weapon to retrieve and then kill him with the sickle. </p>
<p>Incidentally, different schools use different type of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kusarigama (a chain and a sickle).html">kusarigama</a> (a chain and sickle) in shape, length and the position of the chain attached to the neck of the handle, therefore, it is rare to find exactly the same type at an antique shop. </p>
<p>It is believed that <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kusarigama (a chain and a sickle).html">kusarigama</a> was mainly used as a weapon by farmers who were forced to fight in a battlefield, and eventually developed into a martial art form, but the details remain unknown. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, jingama which <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ashigaru.html">ashigaru</a> (a common foot soldier) used in a battlefield was quite different from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kusarigama (a chain and a sickle).html">kusarigama</a>. </p>
<p><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kusarigama (a chain and a sickle).html">Kusarigama</a> jutsu is often transmitted with an art of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Naginata.html">naginata</a> jutsu (art of Japanese halberd). </p>
