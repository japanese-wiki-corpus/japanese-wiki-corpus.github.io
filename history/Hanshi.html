<h1>Hanshi (藩士)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Hanshi were <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> who served Edo period clans. However Hanshi include all <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> ranging from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Joshi (upper-class samurai).html">Joshi</a> (superior warriors) to Kashi (non-commissioned officers), and in a narrow sense, they also include those without <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> status such as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ashigaru.html">ashigaru</a> (common foot soldiers) and chugen (a rank below common soldiers). Therefore it may be said that hanshi are not necessarily <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a>. In other words, it may be correct to say that the Hanshi refers to all people who owned Hanseki (domain registers). However, in many cases, Hanshi refers to the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> class. </p>
<p>Although they mainly served as soldiers playing military roles during the early Edo period, they gradually became bureaucrats and lost most of their military function during the mid-to-late Edo period. </p>
<p>In fact, they didn't call themselves Hanshi during the Edo period. 
<br/>For example, the names of Hanshi in the Satsuma Domain preceded by 'Shimazu Family Retainer' as opposed to 'Satsuma Domain Retainer.'<br/>
</p>
<p>The name 'Hanshi' is also commonly used in the case of domains, such as the Satsuma Domain and Choshu Domain, which had not come under provincial rule the time of the first lord until the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Haihan-chiken (abolition of feudal domains and establishment of prefectures).html">Haihan-chiken</a> (abolition of feudal domains and establishment of prefectures) in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period. However, the term is not appropriate for domains, such as the Kuwana Domain, of which the lord family itself came under provincial rule as a result of orders from the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Edo bakufu.html">Edo bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>). </p>
