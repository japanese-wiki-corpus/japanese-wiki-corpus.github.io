<h1>Sohatsu (hairstyle) (総髪)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Sohatsu is a hairstyle adopted by male <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> priests and Confucian scholars from the early part of the Edo period. The hairstyle for females is called Sogami, which is written with the same kanji characters as Sohatsu. </p>
<p>Sohatsu<br/>
It is a hairstyle in which the forehead is not shaved and the bangs are slicked backward, and the hair is tied together in the back or a topknot is made. The hairstyle in which the hair is tied in a high position is called '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kuwai (Arrowhead Tubers).html">Kuwai</a> atama' for the reason that it looks like <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kuwai (Arrowhead Tubers).html">kuwai</a> (arrowhead), and most doctors adopt this hairstyle in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Jidaigeki (Period Drama).html">jidaigeki</a> (historical plays), but this is fictional. Normally doctors, who went to the war fronts as noncombatants ("kinsoi" or surgeons), shaved their head in order to avoid being shot by mistake; hence, men without a hair were recognized either as a doctor or as a monk in the Edo period. As Nyobon (sexual indulgence) is a sin for Buddhist monks, some infidel monks went to play at Yoshihara <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Yukaku (red-light district).html">yukaku</a> (red-light district) pretending to be a doctor or a master of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Haiku.html">haiku</a> (a Japanese poem in seventeen syllables having a 5-7-5 syllabic form and traditionally containing a reference to the seasons). Apprentice doctors retained some hair. </p>
<p><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> priests and Confucians, in order to show that they had no intention to fight for ideological reasons, did not make Sakayaki (shaved forehead), which was a symbol of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> (warriors), and retained their hair. Furthermore, not only Confucians but also other thinkers selected this hairstyle; thus, Sohatsu became fashionable among young people with the thought of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Sonno Joi.html">Sonno Joi</a> (anti-foreign <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Imperialism.html">imperialism</a>) at the end of the Edo period. </p>
<p>There remain some pictures and photographs of historical characters in Sohatsu, including Shosetsu YUI, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Ryoma SAKAMOTO.html">Ryoma SAKAMOTO</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Isami KONDO.html">Isami KONDO</a>. </p>
