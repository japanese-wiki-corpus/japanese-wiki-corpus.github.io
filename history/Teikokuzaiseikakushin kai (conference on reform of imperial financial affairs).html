<h1>Teikokuzaiseikakushin kai (conference on reform of imperial financial affairs) (帝国財政革新会)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Teikokuzaiseikakushin kai was a political group established in the middle of the Meiji Period. </p>
<p>Tokiichiro SUDO, Ukichi TAGUCHI, and Saburo OZAKI formed this political group in 1894 with political assertions of restructuring the tax system for tax reduction to lessen the burden on the provinces and people. It gained the main support from Tokyo Prefecture Assembly and bussinessmen before being approved for establishment by the prewar Ministry of Home Affairs on March 23. Teikokuzaiseikakushin kai operated in urban areas around Tokyo Prefecture due to its reason for establishment, and its four candidates including SUDO and TAGUCHI were elected in the fourth general election of members of the House of Representatives in 1894 in the hopes of changing from Minto (general term of the political parties such as Liberal Party, Progressive Party and so on which conflicted with a domain government when the Imperial Diet was inaugurated) that was reluctant to reduce business taxes of commercial and industrial men while asserting a reduction in land taxes. </p>
<p>While asserting protection of human rights and taxation and finance reforms, Teikokuzaiseikakushin kai enthusiastically supported the government during the Japanese-Sino War. However, Teikokuzaiseikakushin kai shifted its policy to cooperate with minto due to the opposition to the Treaty of Shimonoseki and the Triple Intervention, and dissolved to join the formation of the Shinpo-to (Progressive Party of the Meiji Period) in 1896. </p>
