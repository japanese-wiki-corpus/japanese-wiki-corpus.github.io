<h1>Certificate of Ownership (安堵状)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Certificate of ownership refers to the letter in which lords such as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>, provincial military governor and feudal lord gave vassal samurais a guarantee for the ownership of a territory and enfeoffment from the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period onwards. </p>
<p>Summary<br/>
Given their nature, many of these letters have been well preserved; descendants of the original recipients have treasured them when they came into their possession and passed them on for posterity. </p>
<p>This kind of letters are very important historical materials because they allow us to detect brushstrokes and habits of feudal lords and others. </p>
