<h1>Certificate of Ownership (安堵状)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Certificate of ownership refers to the letter in which lords such as shogun, provincial military governor and feudal lord gave vassal samurais a guarantee for the ownership of a territory and enfeoffment from the Kamakura period onwards. </p>
<p>Summary<br/>
