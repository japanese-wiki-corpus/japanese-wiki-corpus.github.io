<h1>Igashi no Hen (Incident of the Iga clan) (伊賀氏の変)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Igashi no Hen is a political turmoil that happened in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>), which lasted about a month from June 1224 in the early <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period. Due to the death of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshitoki HOJO.html">Yoshitoki HOJO</a>, Mistumune IGA and Iga no kata, his younger sister and the second wife of Yoshitoki, schemed to have <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Masamura HOJO.html">Masamura HOJO</a>, her biological son, to assume the position of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shikken (regent for the shogun).html">shikken</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Regent.html">regent</a> to the shogunate, and to have <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Sanemasa ICHIJO.html">Sanemasa ICHIJO</a>, her son-in-law, to assume the Shogunship. </p>
<p><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Mitsumune IGA.html">Mitsumune IGA</a> approached Yoshimura MIURA, a powerful <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Gokenin.html">Gokenin</a>, the shogunal retainer of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>. The Ama <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> (the nun-shogun) <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Masako HOJO.html">Masako HOJO</a>, sensing the threatening move of the Iga clan, had <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yasutoki HOJO.html">Yasutoki HOJO</a>, the oldest son of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshitoki HOJO.html">Yoshitoki HOJO</a>, assume the position of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shikken (regent for the shogun).html">Shikken</a>. She succeeded in preventing the political change the Iga clan plotted by ensuring Yoshimura MIURA's commitment to support <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yasutoki HOJO.html">Yasutoki HOJO</a>. </p>
<p>Although Iga no kata, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Mitsumune IGA.html">Mitsumune IGA</a>, and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Sanemasa ICHIJO.html">Sanemasa ICHIJO</a> were exiled for the plot, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Masamura HOJO.html">Masamura HOJO</a>, whom they tried to make the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Regent.html">regent</a>, escaped severe punishment and assumed the seventh <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shikken (regent for the shogun).html">Shikken</a> position later. </p>
<p><h3>Different Opinion</h3>
</p>
<p>The common belief stated above is a theory which identified the "rumor" of the Iga clan's rebellion described in the article of June 28th of Joo era in "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Azuma Kagami.html">Azuma Kagami</a>" (a chronicle of the early history of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>) as a fact. In "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Azuma Kagami.html">Azuma Kagami</a>," it is stated that <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yasutoki HOJO.html">Yasutoki HOJO</a> had investigated on the matter before entering the capital of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a>, and denied the rebellion of the Iga clan as "an untrue rumor which should not be made a fuss about." </p>
<p>Some say <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Masako HOJO.html">Masako HOJO</a>, in fear of decline of her own influence in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> due to having no blood relationship with the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun family.html">Shogun family</a> and the weak connection with the head family of HOJO, designed this incident, which has the same content with the Incident of Maki clan, in order to forcibly ruin the Iga clan, who were to hold strong power as Yoshitoki's widow. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yasutoki HOJO.html">Yasutoki HOJO</a>, not taken in by Masako's plot, calmed the state of affairs, and had <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Mitsumune IGA.html">Mitsumune IGA</a> and others who were punished by Masako reinstated to the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>. </p>
