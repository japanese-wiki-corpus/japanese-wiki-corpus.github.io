<h1>Kendan-sata (criminal cases) (検断沙汰)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>"Kendan-sata" is a term used in medieval Japan, referring to lawsuits and trials relating to criminal cases. </p>
<p>"Kendan" is a word which means both to govern and judge; since public safety administration and criminal justice were undifferentiated in medieval Japan, the concept of governing was closely associated with the concept of judging (according to a Japanese - Portuguese dictionary, "kendan" is a role which governs and judges). Kendan-sata included the suits and trials carried out for charges which threatened public safety, such as cases of murder and injury, theft and robbery, or rebellion. </p>
<p>In the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>), kendan-sata was under the jurisdiction of samurai-dokoro (the Board of Retainers) in Togoku (the eastern part of Japan, particularly Kanto region), and in Saigoku (the western part of Japan), it was under the jurisdiction of kendan-bugyo (magistrate for trial) of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Rokuhara Tandai (an administrative and judicial agency in Rokuhara, Kyoto).html">Rokuhara Tandai</a> (an administrative and judicial agency in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Rokuhara.html">Rokuhara</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>). </p>
<p>In the Muromachi period, the right to judge criminal cases (the right to govern and judge) was decentralized from the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a> (provincial constables), and to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kokujin.html">kokujin</a> (local <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a>) down to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Soson (a community comprising a self-governing association of peasants).html">soson</a> (a community consisting of peasans' self-governing association); in some cases, the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Soson (a community comprising a self-governing association of peasants).html">soson</a>, by exercising such a right, judged the criminal cases which took place in their community (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Jikendan.html">jikendan</a>). </p>
