<p></p>
<p>Kinchu narabini kuge shohatto (law on the emperor and the court nobles) was proclaimed by the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Edo bakufu.html">Edo bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>) to establish its relationships with the emperor and the court nobles. 
<br/>It is also called 'Kinchu narabini kugechu shohatto,' and 'Kinchukata gojomoku.'<br/>
</p>
<p>Summary<br/>
This law was drew up by Konchiin <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Suden.html">Suden</a> under the order of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Ieyasu TOKUGAWA.html">Ieyasu TOKUGAWA</a>. On September 9, 1615, the law was promulgated over the joint signature of the three persons of the retired <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Ieyasu TOKUGAWA.html">Ieyasu TOKUGAWA</a>, the second <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Hidetada TOKUGAWA.html">Hidetada TOKUGAWA</a>, and the former chief adviser to the emperor <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Akizane NIJO.html">Akizane NIJO</a>. The law is written in classical Chinese and consists of 17 Articles. It was not revised throughout the Edo period. </p>
<p>Prior to having enacted this law, 'Kugeshu <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Hatto (Lecture Hall).html">hatto</a>,' 'Jiin shohatto,' and 'Daitokuji myoshinjito <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Shoji (Paper Sliding Screen).html">shoji</a> nyuin <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Hatto (Lecture Hall).html">hatto</a>' had already been promulgated but the basic policy that also targeted for the emperor had been completed with 'Kinchu narabini kuge shohatto.'<br/>
By this law, the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> secured the grounds for legally regulating the act of the imperial court and the law defined the relationships between the imperial court and the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> throughout the Edo period. </p>
<p>The law was not revised throughout the Edo period. On January 8, 1632, 'Wakakugeshu <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Hatto (Lecture Hall).html">hatto</a>' was enacted under the leadership of the then retired <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Gomizunoo.html">Emperor Gomizunoo</a>. 
<br/>Wakakugeshu <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Hatto (Lecture Hall).html">hatto</a>', which was compiled to rectify the young court nobles' morals, promoted the restoration of the imperial events and ceremonies and also tightened the control of the court nobles, turned out to complement 'Kinchu narabini kuge shohatto' although the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> merely indirectly took part in the enactment of 'Wakakugeshu <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Hatto (Lecture Hall).html">hatto</a>.'<br/>
</p>

<p>Main texts<br/>
The original book was burnt in the fire at the Imperial Palace on February 14, 1661 but recovered on the basis of a duplicate, and there are also some copies made by the court nobles remaining; however, it should be treated with caution as some of the extant books have several differences in words and phrases. </p>
<p>一　天子諸芸能ノ事、第一御学問也。<br/>
(Article 1)<br/>
</p>
<p>The most important thing the emperor should pursue is learning. </p>
<p>一　摂家タリト雖モ、其ノ器用無キハ三公摂関ニ任ゼラレルベカラズ。<br/>

(Article 4)<br/>
</p>
<p>Those who are the members of Sekkan-ke (the families which produced regents) but do not have the necessary talents and abilities should not be appointed any of the three ministers (the Grand Minister, the Minister of the left, and the Minister of the right) and Sessho Kanpaku (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Regent.html">regent</a> and chief adviser to the Emperor). Needless to say, those from other than <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Regent.html">regent</a> family cannot be appointed these posts. </p>
<p>一　器用ノ御仁躰、年老ニ及ブト雖モ、三公摂関、辞表有ルベカラズ。<br/>
但シ、辞表有リト雖モ、再任有ルベキ事。<br/>
(Article 5)<br/>
</p>
<p>Any of talented three ministers, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Regent.html">regent</a>, and chief advisor to the emperor should not resign even if he is aged. Even if he resigned once, he should be reappointed. </p>
<p>一　武家ノ官位ハ、公家当官ノ外タルベキ事。<br/>
(Article 7)<br/>
</p>
<p>The official court ranks conferred on kuge (court noble) should be regarded separately from those conferred on buke (the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> families). </p>
<p>一　改元ハ、漢朝年号ノ内、吉例ヲ以テ相定ムベシ。<br/>
(Article 8)<br/>
</p>
<p>The auspicious one from the names of Chinese era should be selected as the name of new era. </p>
<p>一　関白、伝奏並ニ奉行職事等申渡ス儀、堂上地下ノ輩相背クニ於テハ流罪トナスベキ事。<br/>
(Article 11)<br/>
</p>
<p>If the court noble from the Tosho family or the Jige family does not obey the order given by the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Regent.html">regent</a>, the Imperial officials in charge of communication between the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> and the court, or magistrates, he should be exiled. </p>
<p>一　紫衣ノ寺住持職、先規希有ノ事也。<br/>
近年猥リニ勅許ノ事、且ツハ臈次ヲ乱シ、且ツハ官寺ヲ汚シ、甚ダ然ルベカラズ。<br/>
向後ニ於テハ、其ノ器用ヲ撰ビ、戒臈相積ミ智者ノ聞ヘ有ラバ、入院ノ儀申シ沙汰有ルベキ事。<br/>
(Article 16)<br/>
</p>
<p>Only a small number of chief priests were allowed to wear the purple robe before. But recently, the emperor has indiscriminately permitted them and the precedence of the chief priests who are to be allowed to wear the purple robe is confused, which causes the serious matter such as corruption of the official temples. From now on, talents and abilities of the chief priest for the purple robe should be examined and only those who deserves should be allowed to wear the purple robe. </p>
<p><h3>Significance of this law</h3>
</p>
<p>Kinchu narabini kuge shohatto is the epoch-making law in a certain sense. This is because that is the first law to stipulate regulations for the emperor as shown in Article 1. </p>
<p>Before this law, the emperor was treated as an entity transcending the law; therefore, no provision concerning the emperor had existed not only in Buke ho (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">Samurai</a> laws) but also in any law made by the Kuge (court nobles) Government including the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Taiho Ritsuryo (Taiho Code).html">Taiho Ritsuryo</a> and Yoro <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Ritsuryo.html">ritsuryo</a> code (code promulgated in the Yoro period). But, for the first time, the emperor was defined within the law limit. On the other hand, it had been considered essential for the emperor to pursue learning from the ancient times, which was needless to be defined in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Ritsuryo.html">Ritsuryo</a> law. That was made into a statutory law as a duty of the emperor in Article 1, which means that the article 'stipulates' that the emperor did not have the authority to hold the reins of government in fact, which should have been the essential duty of the emperor. Having met the requirements for the court noble law under the joint signature of the chief adviser to the emperor, the law became the legal basis for 'delegating the administration of the country' to the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Edo bakufu.html">Edo bakufu</a>, which had the real authority to enact the law. </p>
<p>Practical analysis of the law shows that it does not contain any provision for directly controlling the imperial court, although it defines the relationships between the imperial court and the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> including the status of buke tenso (liaison officers between the imperial court and the military government) and gave the legal basis for delegating the administration of the country to the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>. This law was applied to all the classes which were appointed by the imperial court and the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> including '<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> families' which were to be appointed the official court rank for <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> under the command of seii taishogun (literally, "great general who subdues the barbarians") that is delegated the administration of the country, and 'Buddhist monks' who were to be appointed the official rank for Sokan (official positions given to Buddhist priests by Imperial Court). Besides, the new stipulations except for those about the relationships between the imperial court and the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> are mostly about the issues which had led confusion in the imperial court including precedence of the imperial court. It can also be said that the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Edo bakufu.html">Edo bakufu</a> showed an attitude of cooperation to restore order of the imperial court and the court noble society which had once almost broken up in the confusion during the Sengoku period (period of warring states). 
<br/>Historically, this case is similar to the fact that the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> presented the principle of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Ryoto (a formal dress for ancient military officers).html">ryoto</a> tetsuritsu (alternate accedence from two ancestries of imperial families) to the imperial court which was split over the issue of the succession to the throne. (The issues regarded as questionable on that are also common to which were difficult issues even for the authority of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> to settle and arose discussions later such as the Shie Incident and the Songo Incident.)<br/>
</p>
<p>In other words, that was the law to establish order for the court nobles, the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> families, and Buddhist monks to serve the emperor and seii taishogun that was delegated the administration of the country by the emperor. </p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Edo bakufu.html">Edo bakufu</a> restored the order of the imperial court and the court noble society by recording the territories of the court nobles in November 1600, the next month of the Battle of Sekigahara, and by defining <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Chigyo.html">chigyo</a> (enfeoffment) including the imperial property against <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Nyoin (a close female relative of the Emperor or a womwan of comparable standing).html">nyoin</a> (a close female relative of the Emperor or a womwan of comparable standing), <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Miyake.html">Miyake</a> (the house of an imperial prince), the court nobles, and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Monzeki (Monseki).html">monzeki</a> (temple formerly led by founder of sect, temple in which resided a member of nobility or imperial family) in the next year. Subsequently, the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> reorganized the system of government officials from the Jige families (for example, the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> made the Suino Hirata family control the Kurodogata) and 'Kinchu narabini kuge shohatto' is considered to be a part of the reorganization. </p>
<p>It is needless to say that the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>, which was delegated the administration of the country by 'Kinchu narabini kuge shohatto,' undoubtedly secured the power to interfere and control the imperial court. The laws which were practically used in controlling the imperial court were, for example, 'Kugeshu-hatto' (the laws for court nobles) and 'Wakakugeshu <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Hatto (Lecture Hall).html">hatto</a>' as the laws about daily life; the former was enacted for reconfirming the court noble laws during the reign of the Toyotomi government due to a great scandal called the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Inokuma Incident.html">Inokuma Incident</a>, and the latter was promoted by the retired <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Gomizunoo.html">Emperor Gomizunoo</a>. The <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Edo bakufu.html">Edo bakufu</a> eventually embarked on the full-fledged control over the imperial court administration on August 21, 1630 when emperor Gomizunoo abdicated the throne, with the memorandum consisting of 15 Articles issued by the retired <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Hidetada TOKUGAWA.html">Hidetada TOKUGAWA</a>, who was a maternal grandfather of the new Emperor Meisho. This memorandum included the rules that the emperor should make a precedent of the retired <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Goyozei.html">Emperor Goyozei</a> who did not rule as the cloistered emperor (denial of a cloister government) and that the council system operated by the heads of Gosekke (five top Fujiwara families whose members were eligible for the positions of Sessho and Kanpaku) should be virtually the supreme decision-making body of the imperial court ("Tobujitsuroku"). It was after this period that the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Edo bakufu.html">Edo bakufu</a> tightened up the control over the imperial court explicitly and implicitly. </p>
