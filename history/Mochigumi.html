<h1>Mochigumi (持組)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Mochigumi was an organization in the Edo bakufu. Mochigumi literally means troops for carrying the arrows (weapons) and matchlock guns of a shogun, but in practice they were arrow and musket troops under shogun's direct orders. </p>
<p>Mochigumi was composed of firearms unit and shooting arrows unit. Although the number of unit varied according to the times, mochigumi was composed of 4 firearms units and 3 shooting arrows units in 1632. Each unit included 10 yoriki (police sergeants) and 50 doshin (police constables) led by the commander of each unit. </p>
