<p><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kanpyo.html">Kanpyo</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Gyoki.html">gyoki</a> is the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Uda.html">Emperor Uda</a>'s diary. It is also called "Uda tenno <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Gyoki.html">gyoki</a>."

<p>It is described as a must-read for Sekkan (regents and advisers) and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kurodo (Chamberlain).html">Kurodo</a> (Chamberlain) to learn the Emperor's manners and the way of working as a political advisor and educating young emperors in "Kanjuhisho" (accounts on the hints on <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kurodo (Chamberlain).html">Kurodo</a>, written by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Toshinori.html">FUJIWARA no Toshinori</a>). 
<br/>And in "Okanoya Kanpaku-ki" diary, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kanetsune KONOE.html">Kanetsune KONOE</a> described it as follows:<br/>
Everything is described so clearly that the past events seem to be right in front of our eyes. This <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Gyoki.html">gyoki</a> includes the interests of subjects, the secrets of politics and the pleasure of poetry (Entry dated on leap month April 9, 1246). </p>
<p>Although the fact that the diary of October 14, 1313 of "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Hanazono Tenno Shinki (The Records of Emperor Hanazono).html">Hanazono Tenno Shinki</a>" (The Records of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Hanazono.html">Emperor Hanazono</a>) described 'Today, I finished reading the 10th volume of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kanpyo.html">Kanpyo</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Gyoki.html">gyoki</a>' shows that <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kanpyo.html">Kanpyo</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Gyoki.html">gyoki</a> existed in 10 volumes, no books exist now. </p>
<p>Also, the existence of more than 50 diaries in 10 years from September 21, 887 when the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Uda.html">Emperor Uda</a> to August 8, 897 were confirmed in itsubun (a composition previously existing but no longer remains) such as "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Saikyuki.html">Saikyuki</a>" (record of court practices and usage, written by MINAMOTO no Takaaki) and "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Fuso Ryakki (A Brief History of Japan).html">Fuso Ryakki</a> (A Brief History of Japan)." </p>
<p>It described a part of the Emperor's daily life and feelings such as political things like how the Ako Controversy, a demonstration of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Mototsune.html">FUJIWARA no Mototsune</a> happened, a black cat which was given by his father, the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Koko.html">Emperor Koko</a> and so on. </p>
