<h1>Mibu Roshi (壬生浪士)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Mibu Roshi, or Seichu Roshi, is a predecessor of the Shinsengumi (a group who guarded Kyoto during the end of Tokugawa Shogunate). </p>
<p>Hachiro KIYOKAWA led a group of roshi (masterless samurai) to Kyoto, and when Kiyokawa 's group returned to Tokyo, 24 members remained in Kyoto to organize Mibu Roshi group in 1863. See below for a list of the members. Before they formed the Shinsengumi, these roshi were made fun of as 'Miboro (meaning raggedy clothes)' because of the poor state of their appearance. They were also called the 'Mibu no Okami (Raggedy Wolves)'. Some say there were female members. </p>
