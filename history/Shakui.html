<h1>Shakui (借位)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Shakui is temporal bestowal of high Ikai (court rank) to officials. It is also called Shakujo. </p>
<p>Shakui was conducted when an official was given an assignment which should be performed by higher-ranking officials, and in some cases he was formally promoted to that higher rank if he succeeded in the assignment. Common cases of shakui were appointment of officials as Kento-shi (Japanese envoy to Tang Dynasty China) or as an envoy to receive foreign messengers, and shakui against gunji (district managers) for the purpose of stabilizing the local administration; in the latter cases, if gunji governed his district well, he was actually promoted in some cases. </p>
