<h1>Suo (素襖)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Suo is a kind of Japanese kimono. Menswear. </p>
<p>Since the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Hitatare.html">hitatare</a> had become a full-dress. Among them, simple and classical style <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Hitatare.html">hitatare</a> were called suo in the Muromachi period. Although it was lower ranked <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a>'s casual wear in the beginning, it became the second most formal dress after <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Daimon.html">daimon</a> (crested formal robe) in the end of the Muromachi period. The largest difference is that <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Hitatare.html">hitatare</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Daimon.html">daimon</a> used a white waist cord while the suo's cord was made with the same cloth. Moreover, strings that pierce around the sleeves and thin cloth around the armhole were omitted, and the breast cord and the ornament cord (decoration strings of sleeves or a breast) were made from leather. Therefore, it is also called '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Hitatare.html">hitatare</a> of kawao' (leather cord). A koshiita (back plate) had been added to the back side of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Hakama (pleated and divided skirt made in fine strips).html">hakama</a> (divided skirt) since the end of the Muromachi period. It might be made with various colors and patterns. </p>
<p>In the Edo period, it was determined as a formal dress for a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> ranked Ikai (court rank) below Rokui (Sixth Rank) by the feudal government. During the Edo period, suo became full dress of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Hatamoto (direct retainers of shogun).html">hatamoto</a> (a direct vassal of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>) because <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Hatamoto (direct retainers of shogun).html">hatamoto</a> was ranked below Ikai. </p>
<p>Its material was limited to bleached cotton, and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kamon (family).html">Kamon</a> (family crest) was put on eight places in total, back, chests, sleeves, koshiita and both sides of slacks side seam of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Hakama (pleated and divided skirt made in fine strips).html">hakama</a>. Usually, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Hakama (pleated and divided skirt made in fine strips).html">hakama</a> was very long and trailed. 
<br/>When 'hanbakama,' an ankle length <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Hakama (pleated and divided skirt made in fine strips).html">hakama</a>, which was not used with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Hitatare.html">hitatare</a> or <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Daimon.html">daimon</a>, was worn, it was called 'kosuo.'<br/>
</p>
<p>Nowadays, suo may be worn by a minister at rites and festivals. Moreover, simplified suo may be used as a costume in Noh plays and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kyogen (farce played during a Noh play cycle).html">kyogen</a>. </p>
<p>In 'Suo Otoshi' of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kyogen (farce played during a Noh play cycle).html">kyogen</a>, suo plays a major role. </p>
