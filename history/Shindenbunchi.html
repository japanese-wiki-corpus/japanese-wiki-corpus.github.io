<h1>Shindenbunchi (新田分知)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Shindenbunchi is a form of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> branch family in the Edo period. When a branch family is established, the family is given a territory newly developed after entering into a new domain, not a territory given by the lord. That made it possible to establish a branch family without losing its <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Omote-daka (face value of kokudaka assessed by the feudal government).html">omote-daka</a> (face value of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kokudaka (The Figure Of Land Productivity).html">kokudaka</a> assessed by the feudal government). This could be often seen when <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> (Japanese feudal lord) and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Hatamoto (direct retainers of shogun).html">hatamoto</a> (direct retainers of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>) established branch families. When the branch family of a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> had more than ten thousands koku (approximately 1.8 million liters of crop yield) in the territory given as shindenbunchi, the branch family might be called XX Shinden-han (domain). Cases with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> will be mainly explained below, but the same is true in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Hatamoto (direct retainers of shogun).html">hatamoto</a> except as otherwise noted. </p>
<p>The forms of shindenbunchi are as follows. A specifically appointed territory distributed (e.g. a branch family of the Matsudaira clan of Matsue Domain). An appointed territory distributed, but the income from the territory as rice stored provided by the head family (e.g. a branch family of the Satake clan of Kubota Domain). Only income provided by the head family without designating territory to be distributed (a branch family of the Asano clan of Hiroshima Domain). </p>
<p>In any case, the territory of a branch family was recognized as a new paddy on newly reclaimed land and was distinguished from originally registered rice paddies. Also, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Omote-daka (face value of kokudaka assessed by the feudal government).html">omote-daka</a> of the head family did not change even when the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> status of the branch family was changed due to succeeding the head family and its territory was returned to it. However, in the cases of fudai <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> (daimyo in hereditary vassal to the Tokugawa family) and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Hatamoto (direct retainers of shogun).html">hatamoto</a> (direct retainers of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>) who were often transferred from one fief to another, the territory of a branch family was sometimes treated as a registered rice paddy with no specific procedure. For example, the Naito clan of Iwakitaira Domain whose crop yields were 70,000 koku received 10,000 koku and established Yunagaya Domain as shindenbunchi in the form of 1, but the territory of 70,000 koku given with the relocation of Nobeoka Domain did not include the territory for Yunagaya Domain. Since the territory of Yunagaya Domain was a new paddy of Iwakitaira Domain, the territory of the branch family should be included in that of the head family even if the head family was relocated. In reality, however, the territory of Yunagaya Domain was regarded as a registered rice paddy independent from Nobeoka Domain. </p>
<p>Even those who received shindenbunchi were treated equally as ordinary <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> or <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Hatamoto (direct retainers of shogun).html">hatamoto</a>, but the administration of their territories was, in most cases, dependent on their head families and their unique administration was a rare case. </p>
<p><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shinden.html">Shinden</a> domains which survived by the end of the Edo period no longer existed after the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Meiji Restoration (Meiji-ishin).html">Meiji Restoration</a> because independent <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Jinya.html">jinya</a> (regional government office) was established or they were absorbed by their head families. </p>
