<h1>Northern Trade (北方貿易)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Northern Trade was the trade between China (Northern Song Dynasty) and the Oshu-Fujiwara clan or the Abe clan (Oshu) and the Dewa <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/family/Kiyohara clan.html">Kiyohara clan</a> who dominated Ou before then. It was done mainly at Tosaminato as the base. Unlike the trade between Japan and the Sung Dynasty in China that was done by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/TAIRA no Kiyomori.html">TAIRA no Kiyomori</a>, it seems to have gone through a northern route. </p>
