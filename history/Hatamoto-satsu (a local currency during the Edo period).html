<p>Hatamoto-satsu was the paper money that a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Hatamoto (direct retainers of shogun).html">hatamoto</a> (direct retainers of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> [Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>]) who possessed his or her own territory in the Edo period issued independently in his or her own territory. </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>As is evident in the name, Hatamoto-satsu was paper money that a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Hatamoto (direct retainers of shogun).html">Hatamoto</a> issued in his chigyo-chi (territory) during the Edo period. Since the chigyo-chi of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Hatamoto (direct retainers of shogun).html">Hatamoto</a> was not called Han (a domain) in general, this paper money was called as such to differentiate it from Han-satsu (the paper money issued by a clan). However, since it was issued and operated in a manner that was quite similar to Han-satsu, Hatamoto-satsu is sometimes treated as Han-satsu in a broad sense. </p>
<p>The chigyo-chi of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Hatamoto (direct retainers of shogun).html">Hatamoto</a> existed widely in the Kanto region centered on <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Musashi Province.html">Musashi Province</a> where Edo was located. However, while no record exists that Hatamoto-satsu was issued in this region, many records exist concerning money being issued in the following areas; western areas from Shinano Province and Mikawa Province to the Kyushu region, in particular, the Kinki region (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Omi Province.html">Omi Province</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Yamato Province.html">Yamato Province</a>, Settsu Province, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Tanba Province.html">Tanba Province</a>, Tajima Province, and Harima Province) and Bitchu Province in the Chugoku region. This situation would have been caused by the following reasons: The Kanto region, which was the base of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>, was strongly controlled by the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>, and as the economy was based on silver in Saigoku (the western region of Japan), more paper money was used there. The clans in the Kanto region did not issue Han-satsu before the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Meiji Restoration (Meiji-ishin).html">Meiji Restoration</a>, except the issuance in the tobichi (detached land) territory in Saigoku. Some clans in the Kanto region that had their tobichi territories in the Kinai region (the five capital provinces surrounding the ancient capitals of Nara and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>) attempted to issue Han-satsu in their own clans in the Kanto region, however the currency had to be halted as people in these clans were not familiar with the use of paper money. </p>
<p>The provinces in the Kinki region and in Bitchu Province, where <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>'s territories, clans' territories, the tobichi territories in other clans, the territories of Gosankyo (three privileged branch families of the Tokugawa family), and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Hatamoto (direct retainers of shogun).html">Hatamoto</a>'s territories mixed quite complicatedly, were the area of advanced commodity economy as well. Therefore, transactions with other territories comprised a large portion of economic activities in these areas. In addition, after the late Edo period, the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> took the policy of intentionally controlling the amount of the silver-based currencies that was being circulated, and therefore, lots of promissory notes and Han-satsu were used for transactions. Consequently, the economy in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Hatamoto (direct retainers of shogun).html">Hatamoto</a>'s territories was quite negatively affected by the inflow of Han-satsu and the like from other territories. In order to prevent this situation from occurring, not a few <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Hatamoto (direct retainers of shogun).html">Hatamoto</a> territories were forced to issue their own paper money as small clans and the tobichi territories of the clans in the Kanto region were. On the other hand, for the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kotaiyoriai.html">kotaiyoriai</a> (alternate <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Yoriai.html">yoriai</a>, a family status of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> warriors in the Edo period), that were <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Hatamoto (direct retainers of shogun).html">Hatamoto</a> but were obliged to keep Sankinkotai (a system under which feudal lords in the Edo period were required to spend every other year residing in Edo) and ensured the control system similar to that of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> (Japanese feudal lord) because their earnings were less than 10,000 koku of rice (approximately 180 liters per koku), it is also considered that there might have been slightly more independent situations to issue paper money. </p>
<p>Additionally, the paper money by the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Hatamoto (direct retainers of shogun).html">Hatamoto</a>, the Matsudaira family in Nagasawa, Hoi County, Mikawa Province was exceptional case. Being provided a high status due to its close relationship with the Tokugawa <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> family, the Matsudaira family in Nagasawa was treated as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Hatamoto (direct retainers of shogun).html">Hatamoto</a> with the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kotaiyoriai.html">kotaiyoriai</a> status, but earned only 200 koku of rice for <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Chigyo.html">chigyo</a> (control of a territory). Therefore, after allowance of the right to issue paper money from the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>, the family provided the right to towns and villages as the legal guarantee of issuing paper money and as the credibility of such money, to secure income. The Hatamoto-satsu of the Nagasawa-Matsudaira family was issued in several provinces such as Omi, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Yamato.html">Yamato</a>, Kawachi, Izumi, Harima, and Bitchu. </p>
<p>In 1871, the new government checked the Han-satsu and the like that had been issued, to establish a new currency system. Then, after confirming that 244 clans, approximately 80 percents of all clans in the nation, 14 magistrate's offices, and 9 <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Hatamoto (direct retainers of shogun).html">Hatamoto</a> territories had issued paper money, the government specified a rate of exchange, to be used to exchange each of these paper moneys for a new currency, to correct the situation. However, the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Hatamoto (direct retainers of shogun).html">Hatamoto</a> who issued the paper money were only those of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Hatamoto (direct retainers of shogun).html">Hatamoto</a> who were actually checked by the new government during the early <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period. Of the existing old paper money and the like, ones that contain the Hatamoto-satsu written on the surface of the paper money are sometimes found, which can be classified as Hatamoto-satsu, it has been revealed that at least several tens of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Hatamoto (direct retainers of shogun).html">Hatamoto</a> issued Hatamoto-satsu. <h3>Chubu region</h3>
</p>
<p>It has been confirmed that Hatamoto-satsu was issued in the three provinces of Shinano Province (present Nagano Prefecture), Mikawa Province (the present eastern part of Aichi Prefecture) and Mino Province (the present southern part of Gifu Prefecture). Many of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Hatamoto (direct retainers of shogun).html">Hatamoto</a> who issued Hatamoto-satsu in this region were those with the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kotaiyoriai.html">kotaiyoriai</a> status. <h3>Shinano, Mikawa, and Mino Provinces</h3>
</p>
<p>In the Shinano Province, the Sengoku clan in Yazawa, Chiisagata County (present Tonoshiro, Ueda City, Nagano Prefecture) issued small amount of zeni-satsu (a kind of Han-satsu) such as 16 mon (a unit of currency) paper money and 24 mon paper money in January 1863, to mitigate the difficult situation in trade that had been caused by the shortage of government-issued money due to the confusion that occurred during the end of the Edo period. The Ogasawara clan in Izuki, Ina County (present Izuki, Iida City, Nagano Prefecture), who was a member of the Ina group of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Hatamoto (direct retainers of shogun).html">Hatamoto</a> with the kotaiyoriai-shu status, issued paper money in the early <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period. The Izuki-Ogasawara clan's paper money issued in 1869 has its surface format style slightly resembling the Daijokan-satsu paper money issued by the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> new government, as well as the Han-satsu issued by clans in the same period throughout Japan. </p>
<p>In Mikawa Province, the Suganuma clan in Shinshiro, Shitara County (present Shinshiro, Shinshiro City, Aichi Prefecture), which was provided with kotaiyoriai-omoteoreishu (a status of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kotaiyoriai.html">kotaiyoriai</a> similar to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a>), and the Nagasawa-Matsudaira family in Nagasawa, Hoi County (present Nagasawa-cho, Toyokawa City, Aichi Prefecture), which was provided with status equivalent to the shishu (four major groups of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kotaiyoriai.html">kotaiyoriai</a>) of kotaiyoriai-shu families, issued paper money. Shinshiro-Suganuma clan's paper money had a style resembling the Shukueki-satsu issued in Shukueki (relay station towns) along the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/road/Tokaido.html">Tokaido</a> road, because it was located at an important distribution spot in the Shinshu-kaido road connecting the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/road/Tokaido.html">Tokaido</a> road to the Shinano Province. As previously described, the Nagasawa-Matsudaira clan's paper money was issued in various provinces independently; it was strongly affected by the money-format style in the area where it was issued. Since several versions of the money were issued in each province, the paper currency in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Yamato.html">Yamato</a>, Kawachi, Izumi, and Bitchu Provinces were undertaken various people because of the characteristics of the provinces. </p>
<p>In Mino Province, the Takenaka clan in Iwate, Fuwa County (present Iwate, Tarui Town, Fuwa County, Gifu Prefecture), which was provided with kotaiyoriai-omoteoreishu status, and the Takagi clan in Tara, Ishizu County (present, Miya, Kamiishizu-cho, Ogaki City, Gifu Prefecture), which was a member of Mino group of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Hatamoto (direct retainers of shogun).html">Hatamoto</a> with the yoriaikotai-shu status, issued paper money. The paper currencies issued by both clans in the western Mino area was so-called Sumidai-satsu (literally, paper money for charcoal price) issued by Sumikaisho (literally, a charcoal association) to make the money circulated by using it in trading charcoal that was a daily necessity. <h3>Kinki region</h3>
</p>
<p>Provinces close to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, where, of the three capitals, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and Osaka were located, were in the state of a typical hi-ryogokuchiiki area (where the area was divided minutely, with each piece of area owned by a different person) as in the Kanto region, except Kii Province (present Wakayama Prefecture and the southern part of the Mie Prefecture) and Awaji Province (present entire area of the Awaji island in Hyogo Prefecture). The provinces where Hatamoto-satsu was confirmed to have been issued were the followings: the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Omi Province.html">Omi Province</a> (present <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Shiga Prefecture.html">Shiga Prefecture</a>), the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Yamato Province.html">Yamato Province</a> (present Nara Prefecture), the Settsu Province (present northern part of Osaka Prefecture and present southeastern part of the Hyogo Prefecture), the Kawachi Province (present southeastern part of Osaka Prefecture), the Izumi Province (present southwestern part of Osaka Prefecture), the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Tanba Province.html">Tanba Province</a> (present central part of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>, and Sasayama City and Tanba City, Hyogo Prefecture), the Tajima Province (present northern part of Hyogo Prefecture), and the Harima Province (present southwestern part of Hyogo Prefecture). </p>
<p>The Kinki region was at the center of the location where the Satsu-tsukai (Han-satsu) was used, and not a few chigyo-chi territories of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Hatamoto (direct retainers of shogun).html">Hatamoto</a> existed there as well. Therefore, Hatamoto-satsu was issued by many <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Hatamoto (direct retainers of shogun).html">Hatamoto</a> persons. 
<br/>As the situation was dependent on the province, how Hatamoto-satsu was issued is described as follows for each province:<br/>
<h3><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Omi Province.html">Omi Province</a></h3>
</p>
<p>Hatamoto-satsu issued in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Omi Province.html">Omi Province</a> was provided with the feature that the money was issued by high-class <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Hatamoto (direct retainers of shogun).html">Hatamoto</a> with <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kotaiyoriai.html">kotaiyoriai</a> or <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Hatamoto (direct retainers of shogun).html">hatamoto</a> yoriaiseki (a family rank of high-ranking <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Hatamoto (direct retainers of shogun).html">hatamoto</a>, direct vassal of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>) status. The Kuchiki clan (kotaiyoriai-omoteoreishu) in Kuchiki, Takashima County (present Kuchikinojiri, Takashima City, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Shiga Prefecture.html">Shiga Prefecture</a>), from where the head family linage of the Kuchiki family in Fukuchiyama clan, was a distinguished family on which the Ashikaga <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> family often counted in emergencies. The Mogami clan in Omori, Gamo County (present Omori-cho, Higashiomi City) was originally a distinguished clan in the Dewa Province and the lord of the Yamagata-jo Castle, but due to family issues, the amount of its chigyo-chi territory was reduced and transferred to this location. Later, as its territory was further reduced, the clan was provided with kotaiyoriai-omoteoreishu status, while retaining <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kokushu.html">Kokushu</a> (a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> owing a territory) status. The Saigusa clan (also referred as the Saegusa clan) in Iba, Kanzaki County (present Iba-cho, Higashiomi City) was a distinguished clan in the Kai Province of which members were senior vassals to the Takeda clan. The Seki clan in Nakayama, Gamo County (present Nakayama, Hino Town, Gamo County, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Shiga Prefecture.html">Shiga Prefecture</a>) had been a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> who assumed the lord of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Kameyama-jo Castle.html">Kameyama-jo Castle</a> in the Ise Province and the lord of the Kurosaka-jo Castle in the Hoki Province. However, due to family issues the territory was confiscated, and its adopted son, for whom the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Hatamoto (direct retainers of shogun).html">Hatamoto</a> status was given a new, established the present Seki family. The Negoro clan in Oiso, Gamo County (present Higashioiso, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Azuchi Town.html">Azuchi Town</a>, Gamo County), was a descendant of Morishige SEISHININ of Negoro-ji Temple in Kii Province who resisted attacks on Negoro-ji Temple by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI.html">Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI</a>, and came to belong to the Tokugawa family later. In addition to Oiso, where the clan had <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Jinya.html">jinya</a> (a regional government office), the Oiso-Negoro clan issued Hatamoto-satsu with a similar surface format style, in its territory in Uchi County, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Yamato Province.html">Yamato Province</a>. </p>
<p>Although assumed to be used as gin-date (payment based on silver) or sen-date (payment based on sen [a unit of currency at that time]) paper money, Hatamoto-satsu in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Omi Province.html">Omi Province</a> was provided with the feature that each piece of the paper money was nominally a stamp for goods (or exchange ticket) such as follows: Sumi-kitte (stamps for charcoal) issued by the Kuchiki clan, Tane-kitte (stamps for seeds) by the Iba-Saigusa clan, Mame-kitte (stamps for beans) by the Nakayama-Seki clan, Mame-tegata (promissory notes for beans) by the Oiso-Negoro clan, and Cha-kitte (stamps for tea) by the Omori-Mogami clan. In <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Omi Province.html">Omi Province</a>, many of the Han-satsu issued in its clans in the Edo period such as that issued by the Hikone clan, that by the Mizuguchi clan, and that by the Omizo clan, were provided with similar features. <h3><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Yamato Province.html">Yamato Province</a></h3>
</p>
<p><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Yamato Province.html">Yamato Province</a> was an area with one of the most advanced commodity economies in Japan. In addition to Han-satsu and Hatamoto-satsu, various types of paper money were issued here including the Gomengin-satsu paper money substituted silver coin which an autonomous body in Yoshino County issued under the allowance of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> with the similar style to Yamada-hagaki in Ise Province, known as the oldest paper money in Japan, and the Jisha-satsu issued by big temples or shrines. The economy of this area in which <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Zaigomachi (local town).html">Zaigomachi</a> (villages with the function of a town) developed to purchase fertilizers (such as dried sardines and oil cake) and to sell commercial crops (such as cotton, rape, and tea) had strong economical connections with the Kawachi Province and Izumi Province along the popular distribution channels. Therefore, the Han-satsu, Hatamoto-satsu, and Jisha-satsu issued in this area were sometimes undertaken by various persons across the boundaries of the province, depending on the source that issued the paper money. Because lots of rice crops were produced in the Nara basin, many gin-satsu (paper money equivalent in value to a silver coin) in the Kome-tegata format (promissory notes for rice crop) were issued. </p>

It has been confirmed that, of them, at least the Minokami and Yamamoto-Koide clans, the Kurami-Koide clan, and the Oyabu-Koide clan issued Hatamoto-satsu. <h3>Harima Province</h3>
</p>
<p>It has been confirmed that, in Harima Province, quite a variety of paper money, such as Han-satsu, Hatamoto-satsu, Jisha-satsu, Choson-satsu (paper money issued by a town or a village), and Shijin-satsu (paper money issued by a private person), were issued. Harima Province was one of the richest grain-yielding areas in the nation, and, together with other provinces in the Kinai region, flourished in growing commercial farm products. In addition, with their substantial population, the province was a typical Hi-ryogokuchiiki, except the Himeji clan, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Akashi (The Tale of Genji).html">Akashi</a> clan and Ako clan, each of which occupied a sizable territory. Located almost in the center of Harima Province, the Himeji clan had a sizable economic power that affected its surrounding areas, for example, the exclusive sales of cotton. However, each of the surrounding areas formed a relatively independent economic area, depending on road transportation along the Saigoku-kaido road or the Mimasaka and Inaba-kaido roads, or on water transportation on the Kako-gawa River, the Ichi-kawa River (in Hyogo Prefecture), or the Ibo-gawa River. Hatamoto-satsu was strongly affected by the characteristics of each small territory of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Hatamoto (direct retainers of shogun).html">Hatamoto</a>. </p>
<p>It was a feature of the Han-satsu and Hatamoto-satsu in Harima Province that senme-satsu (paper money convertible to sen) was issued widely. Senme-satsu was a paper money with the following features: The face value was written in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Monme (A Weight Unit in The Japanese Traditional System of Weights And Measures).html">monme</a>, bu, or rin (each a monetary unit at that time) of the silver unit, but it was also written there that the money would be exchanged into zeni (copper or iron coins) based on a certain gin (silver coin)-zeni exchange rate. This is an interesting business custom when talking about the monetary economy system in the Edo period, together with the Eisen-kanjo (a calculational procedure using <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Eiraku-tsuho (bronze coins struck in the Ming dynasty).html">Eiraku-tsuho</a> [bronze coins struck in the Ming dynasty] as a fictional unit) in Bitchu Province and senme-satsu in the northern part of Kyushu and in the western part of Shikoku. </p>
<p>The Ikeda clan in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Shingu.html">Shingu</a>, Itto County, was originally the Shimoma clan, a steward of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Higashi Hongan-ji Temple.html">Higashi Hongan-ji Temple</a>. However, the clan became a retainer of his uncle <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Terumasa IKEDA.html">Terumasa IKEDA</a>, the lord of the Himeji clan, due to internal problems in inheriting the steward post, and was permitted to use the surname of Ikeda, and then established the Harima-Shingu clan. Later, the family was going to be abolished due to its lack of an heir, but as a result of earnest efforts by the family of the Okayama domain lord and Tottori clan's lord, its head family, was permitted to exist as a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Hatamoto (direct retainers of shogun).html">Hatamoto</a>, although its territory was reduced. Its <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Jinya.html">jinya</a> was also placed in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Shingu.html">Shingu</a> (present <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Shingu.html">Shingu</a>, Shingu-cho, Tatsuno City) since the time of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Shingu.html">Shingu</a> clan. The Mimasaka-kaido road was branched from the Saigoku-kaido road (Sanyo-do road) slightly west of the Himeji-jo Castle town towards the northwest direct, reaching the area of Tsuyama-jo Castle town in Mimasaka Province. The town of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Shingu.html">Shingu</a> was located at the spot where the Mimasaka-kaido road came near to the Ibo-gawa River heavily used for water transportation. The Shingu-Ikeda clan issued gin-satsu and senme-satsu. </p>
<p>Further down the Mimasaka-kaido road, there were the chigyo-chi territories of three <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Hatamoto (direct retainers of shogun).html">Hatamoto</a> of the Matsui-Matsudaira clan such as Sayo, Sayo County (present Sayo, Sayo Town, Sayo County), Nagatani, Sayo County (present Kuchinagatani, Sayo Town, Sayo County), and Hirafuku, Sayo County (present Hirafuku, Sayo Town, Sayo County). These were the same clans derived from the Matsui-Matsudaira clan, the lord of Yamazaki clan, and established as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Hatamoto (direct retainers of shogun).html">Hatamoto</a> families given the divided territories in Sayo County. Sayo was a shuku-eki (a relay station in road transportation) along the Mimasaka-kaido road, which was branched from Sayo to the Inaba-kaido road in the north. Hirafuku was a next shuku-eki along the Inaba-kaido road, and Nagatani was located slightly in the south of Hirafuku. 
<br/>Furthermore, in the vicinity of each of these <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Jinya.html">jinya</a> places, the Chikusa-gawa River water system was used for water transportation<br/>
Although the three families lived near to each other, each of them issued its own paper money. </p>
<p>The Asano clan in Wakasano, Ako County (present Wakasano, Wakasano-cho, Aioi City), was located in the neighborhood downstream of the Chikusa-gawa River. This clan was a branch of the Asano family in the Ako clan famous for the Ako Incident in the Genroku era (1688 - 1704). Although its main family was abolished and the Ako clan came to be controlled by the Nagai clan, followed by the Mori clan, this clan continued owning its territory within Ako County most of which was occupied by the Ako clan. Undertaken by the Tennoji-ya money exchanger in Osaka, this Wakasano-Asano clan issued gin-satsu and senme-satsu. In the former <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Jinya.html">jinya</a> site in Wakasano, the office building where paper money-related jobs were done still exists. </p>
<p>The Asano clan in Iehara, Kato County (present Iehara, Kato City) in the eastern part of Harima Province, was also a branch of the main family of the Ako clan. The Asano clan in the Ako clan owned a territory in Kato County as well, in addition to Ako County where its castle residence was located, and placed a remote <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Jinya.html">jinya</a> in Hozumi, Kato County (present Hozumi, Kato City). However, after the Asano clan in the Ako clan was abolished due to the Ako Incident in the Genroku era, the site was officially confiscated by the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>, and villages including Hozumi became the territory of the Yagi clan, a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Hatamoto (direct retainers of shogun).html">Hatamoto</a>. The Yagi clan used the Hozumi <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Jinya.html">jinya</a> of the Asano clan as the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Jinya.html">jinya</a> for its own territory. The Yagi clan, a lineage of the family that branched in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period from the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/family/Asakura clan.html">Asakura clan</a> which later became Sengoku <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a>, was the lord of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Yagi-jo Castle (Tanba Province).html">Yagi-jo Castle</a> when the Oda clan invaded Tajima Province. However, its territory was lost when the Mori clan fought with the Oda clan, and the clan was picked as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Hatamoto (direct retainers of shogun).html">Hatamoto</a> of the Tokugawa family, by its distinguished accomplishments in the Battle of Sekigahara. Iehara was located in the vicinity of the Chidori-gawa River, a tributary of the Kako-gawa River, and Hozumi around the place where the Chidori-gawa River and the Kako-gawa River merged. Both the Iehara-Asano clan and the Hozumi-Yagi clan issued own gin-satsu and senme-satsu. </p>
<p>When the lord family of the Iyo-Saijo clan was abolished then pardoned later to become a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Hatamoto (direct retainers of shogun).html">Hatamoto</a>, the Hitotsuyanagi clan in Takagi, Mino County (present Takagi, Bessho-cho, Miki City), was given villages centered on Takagi as its territory. Takagi was the Miki-jo Castle town where the Bessho clan lived, near Miki Town which was flourished as a hardware town by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI.html">Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI</a> giving the town a tax-free privilege, and slightly in the north, the Mino-gawa river, a tributary of the Kako-gawa River, flowed to the west. With Mino County producing cotton, the Takagi-Hitotsuyanagi clan issued paper money in the form of stamps for cotton. </p>
<p>The Ikeda clan in Fukumoto, Jinto County (present Fukumoto, Kamikawa Town, Kanzaki County), was established as a branch clan of the Tottori clan. However, because its earning came to less than 10,000 koku after generating branch families, it became a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Hatamoto (direct retainers of shogun).html">Hatamoto</a> with kotaiyoriai-omoteoreishu status. The territory of the Fukumoto-Ikeda clan and that of its two branch families (the Ogata-Ikeda clan and the Yoshitomi-Ikeda clan) occupied Jinto County and the northern part of Jinsai County in the upper reaches of the Ichi-kawa River (in Hyogo Prefecture), with Kufumoto located near the east side of the Ichi-kawa River. Although they reestablished a clan by receiving kuramai from the Tottori clan in the end of the Edo period, the Fukumoto-Ikeda clan issued gin-satsu and senme-satsu in 1822 when the clan was a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Hatamoto (direct retainers of shogun).html">Hatamoto</a>, as well as in 1868 after having newly established its own clan. <h3>Chubu region and Shikoku region</h3>
</p>
<p>Many kunimochi-daimyo (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> with a big territory) were in the Chugoku and Shikoku regions, such as the Okayama clan (Bizen Province, present southeastern part of Okayama Prefecture), the Hiroshima clan (Aki Province, present western part of Hiroshima Prefecture), the Choshu clan (Nagato and Suo Provinces, present western and eastern parts of Yamaguchi Prefecture), the Tottori clan (Inaba and Hoki Provinces, present the western and eastern parts of Tottori Prefecture), the Matsue clan (Izumo Province, present eastern part of Shimane Prefecture), the Tokushima clan (Awa and Awaji Provinces, present Tokushima Prefecture and Awaji-shima Island, Hyogo Prefecture), and the Kochi clan (Tosa Province, present Kochi Prefecture), and only Bitchu Province (present western part of Okayama Prefecture) was in the hi-ryogokuchiiki state where <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Hatamoto (direct retainers of shogun).html">Hatamoto</a> territories were scattered. <h3>Bitchu Province</h3>
</p>
<p>Bitchu Province was occupied by 8 clans and more than 10 territories of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Hatamoto (direct retainers of shogun).html">Hatamoto</a> families, the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>, and the Gosankyo, and so on including the 50,000-koku Bitchu-Matsuyama clan. Of them, all of the clans and almost all of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Hatamoto (direct retainers of shogun).html">Hatamoto</a> who placed their <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Jinya.html">jinya</a> offices to manage their territories in the province issued Han-satsu or Hatamoto-satsu. Bitchu Province is also known as an area where a variety of private paper money and the like were issued as well by towns, villages, wealthy farmers or wealthy merchants, and so on. The <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Hatamoto (direct retainers of shogun).html">Hatamoto</a> families that issued Hatamoto-satsu in Bitchu Province were descendants of powerful retainers of Sengoku <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a>, the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Hatamoto (direct retainers of shogun).html">Hatamoto</a> families that had originally been <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> of the Tokugawa shogunate but became <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Hatamoto (direct retainers of shogun).html">Hatamoto</a> because their territories were reduced, or branch families of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> families. </p>
<p>The Maita clan (the lord of the Asao clan, later <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Hatamoto (direct retainers of shogun).html">Hatamoto</a> reduced its territory, then reestablished the clan by a review towards increasing the amount of rice produced in the end of the Edo period) in Asao, Kaya County (present Monde, Soja City, Okayama Prefecture), and the Misu-Maita clan in Misu, Boya County (present Misu, Soja City, Okayama Prefecture), which was a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Hatamoto (direct retainers of shogun).html">Hatamoto</a> established getting a portion of the Aso-Maita clan's territory, issued their own Hatamoto-satsu respectively. </p>
<p>The Yamazaki clan in Nariwa, Kawakami County (present Shimohara, Nariwa-cho, Takahashi City, Okayama Prefecture), was a branch family of the Yamazaki clan, a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> which governed the Tomioka clan in Higo Province and the Marugame clan in the Sanuki Province, and so on, and continued to exist with its <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Jinya.html">jinya</a> placed in the former Nariwa-jo Castle site of which the main family once served as the keeper, even after its main family was abolished. It was treated as a kotaiyoriai-omoteoreishu status, and established its own clan after the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Meiji Restoration (Meiji-ishin).html">Meiji Restoration</a> by a review towards increasing the amount of rice produced. The Nariwa-Yamazaki clan also issued Hatamoto-satsu when they were a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Hatamoto (direct retainers of shogun).html">Hatamoto</a>. </p>
<p>Having originally been a retainer of the Ukita clan, a Sengoku <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a>, the Togawa clan was given <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Hatamoto (direct retainers of shogun).html">Hatamoto</a> status because of their acquaintance with <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Ieyasu TOKUGAWA.html">Ieyasu TOKUGAWA</a> related with his intermediacy on internal issues of the Ukita family. The Hatamoto Togawa clan consisted largely of the four families of the Natsukawa-Togawa clan (from the lord of the Niwase clan to be kotaiyoriai-omoteoreishu status by reducing its territory) in Natsukawa, Tsu County (present Natsukawa, Okayama City, Okayama Prefecture), the Seno-Togawa clan in Seno, Tsu County (present Seno, Okayama City, Okayama Prefecture), the Hayashima-Togawa clan in Hayashima, Tsu County (present Hayashima, Hayashima Town, Tsukubo County, Okayama Prefecture), and the Obie-Togawa clan in Obie, Tsu County (present Hashima, Kurashiki City, Okayama Prefecture), and each of them issued its own Hatamoto-satsu. </p>
<p>Having been a retainer of the Ukita clan as well, the Hanabusa clan was taken under <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Ieyasu TOKUGAWA.html">Ieyasu TOKUGAWA</a>'s protection after an internal issued in the Ukita family, and belonged to the East squad in the Battle of Sekigahara. Furthermore, the clan was given <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Hatamoto (direct retainers of shogun).html">Hatamoto</a> status for the reason that the clan contributed to stabilize the state of Bitchu Province in post-battle operations. Placing its <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Jinya.html">jinya</a> in Harakosai of Takamatsu, Kayo County (present Takamatsuhara <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Kosai.html">Kosai</a>, Okayama City, Okayama Prefecture), a neighborhood of Bitchu-Takamatsu-jo Castle famous for the inundation tactics of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI.html">Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI</a> (the Battle of Bitchu-Takamatsu-jo Castle), the clan issued Hatamoto-satsu. The Sakakibara clan, a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Hatamoto (direct retainers of shogun).html">Hatamoto</a> in Tsudera, Tsu County (present Tsudera, Okayama City, Okayama Prefecture), originated in the Hanabusa clan. However, on being picked by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Ieyasu TOKUGAWA.html">Ieyasu TOKUGAWA</a>, the clan changed its name to Sakakibara to show its gratitude to the efforts of the Sakakibara clan, a fudai <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> (a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> in hereditary vassal to the Tokugawa family) acting as an intermediary. The Tsudera-Sakakibara clan issued Hatamoto-satsu as well. </p>
<p>The Mizutani clan was the lord of Bitchu-Matsuyama clan, but was abolished due to having no heir. The Osakabe-Mizutani clan in Osakabe, Aga County (present Osaosakabe, Niimi City, Okayama Prefecture), and the Fukakokucho-Mizutani clan in Fuka, Kawakami County (present Fuka, Bitchu-cho, Takahashi City, Okayama Prefecture) existed as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Hatamoto (direct retainers of shogun).html">Hatamoto</a>, and each issued its own Hatamoto-satsu. </p>
<p>The Ikeda clan, a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Hatamoto (direct retainers of shogun).html">Hatamoto</a> in Ibara, Itsuki County (present Ibara-cho, Ibara City, Okayama Prefecture), belonged to the same clan as that of the Ikeda clan in the Tottori clan and in the Okayama clan, and was a descendant of Nagayoshi IKEDA, who was a younger biological brother of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Terumasa IKEDA.html">Terumasa IKEDA</a> and the first lord of the Bitchu-Matsuyama clan. The Ibara-Ikeda clan continued to exist even after its main family, the Ikeda family of the Bitchu-Matsuyama clan, was abolished due to lack of an heir, and was issued Hatamoto-satsu. </p>
<p>A few of the Han-satsu or Hatamoto-satsu in Bitchu Province was often found written on the face value by Eisen-kanjo procedure. Eisen referred the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Eiraku-tsuho (bronze coins struck in the Ming dynasty).html">Eiraku-tsuho</a> coins (bronze coins struck in the Ming dynasty) that were used throughout the nation from the Muromachi period to the early Edo period when the currency system by the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Edo bakufu.html">Edo bakufu</a> was established. Use of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Eiraku-tsuho (bronze coins struck in the Ming dynasty).html">Eiraku-tsuho</a> coins itself was prohibited by the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Edo bakufu.html">Edo bakufu</a>, but the name itself was used as an auxiliary monetary unit through the Edo period, with 1 <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kamon (family).html">kamon</a> (1,000 mon) of Eisen set being equivalent to 1 ryo (a unit of currency) of gold. The Eisen-kanjo procedure itself was generally used, for example, by money exchangers, but it was a feature specific for this area in that the procedure was used for expressing the monetary worth of paper money. <h3>Kyushu region</h3>
</p>
<p>It is known that, in the Kyushu region, the Ogasawara clan in Tokieda of Buzen Province (present eastern part of Fukuoka Prefecture and northeastern part of Oita Prefecture), the Kinoshita clan in Tateishi, Bungo Province (present Oita Prefecture, excluding its northeastern part), and the Mera clan in Mera, Higo Province (present Kumamoto Prefecture and mountainous area in the southwestern part of Miyazaki Prefecture) issued Hatamoto-satsu. <h3>Buzen and Bungo Provinces</h3>
</p>
<p>Being a branch family of the lord family of the Nakatsu clan, the Tokieda-Ogasawara clan was a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Hatamoto (direct retainers of shogun).html">Hatamoto</a> that had a territory that produced 5,000 koku of rice crop, centered on Tokieda of Buzen Province (present Shimo-Tokieda, Usa City, Oita Prefecture). The Hatamoto-satsu issued by the Tokieda-Ogasawara clan included the senme-satsu issued in 1826 from Tokieda-sanbutsukaisho (the product business promotion body in Tokieda) and that issued in 1858 from Tokieda-kanjosho (the organization handling financial and public affairs in Tokieda). The Tateishi-Kinoshita clan, a branch of the lord family of the Hiji clan, was given the kotaiyoriai-omoteoreishu status, with a 5,000 koku of rice crop centered on Tateishi, Bungo Province (present Tateishi, Yamaga-machi, Kitsuki City, Oita Prefecture). The Hatamoto-satsu issued by the Tateishi Kinoshita clan included the senme-satsu issued several times by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kanjosho.html">kanjosho</a> (the organization handling financial and public affairs) or others in 1825 or later. </p>
<p>The Hatamoto-satsu issued by the Tokieda-Ogasawara clan and by the Tateishi-Kinoshita clan included many on which the face value was expressed with senme value, as typically seen among the Han-satsu and Hatamoto-satsu issued in the northern part of Kyushu, including chigyo-chi. Senme-satsu was paper money with the following features: The face value was written in the unit of silver (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Monme (A Weight Unit in The Japanese Traditional System of Weights And Measures).html">monme</a>, bu, or rin; each a monetary unit at that time) on it, but it was also written there that the money would be exchanged into zeni based on a certain gin (silver coin)-zeni exchange rate. It can be confirmed that senme-satsu itself was issued in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Tango (the Boys Festival).html">Tango</a>, Harima, and Iyo Provinces independently (at least they had no common boundaries geographically). However, some paper money issued by clans or <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Hatamoto (direct retainers of shogun).html">Hatamoto</a> in the northern part of Kyushu had a distinguishing feature not found in other areas, in which an exchange rate between gin (silver) coins and zeni coins was explicitly written on the surface (for example: 7-sen and 10-monme indicated that the coins of 70 mon should be given for 1 <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Monme (A Weight Unit in The Japanese Traditional System of Weights And Measures).html">monme</a>, and therefore, this paper money could be exchanged to coins of 700 mon). <h3>Higo Province</h3>
</p>
<p>The Mera clan was a descendant of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/family/Kikuchi clan.html">Kikuchi clan</a>, a distinguished clan that supported the Southern Court (in Japan) in the period of the Northern and Southern Courts (in Japan) and fled to the mountainous area of Kyushu, or more specifically, in Mt. Mera of Mera County, Higo Province, after being defeated in the war. The clan became acquainted with <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Ieyasu TOKUGAWA.html">Ieyasu TOKUGAWA</a> when Mt. Mera was designated as Mt. Takanosu, and picked by Ieyasu, after which they received kotaiyoriai-shu status (a family with the status equivalent of that of the Shishu). The clan built its residence in Ogawa, at the center of Mera of Higo Province (present Murasho, Nishimera Village, Koyu County, Miyazaki Prefecture). With their territory located in a mountain, no rice could grow, and therefore, their <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kokudaka (The Figure Of Land Productivity).html">kokudaka</a> (crop yield) amounted to zero. However, the clan earned income by converting lumber, kazoo (the tree from which washy paper was produced), tea, and shiitake mushroom into money or rice. The Hatamoto-satsu issued by the Mera clan included 500-mon, 100-mon or 48-mon Zeni-azukari-satsu (銭預札; paper money equivalent to zeni copper coins) issued by Okatte-za (御勝手座; an organization to undertake the paper money) in around 1862. The Mera clan had strong connections militarily, politically as well as economically, with adjacent clans that shared boundaries with its territory, such as the Hitoyoshi clan in Higo Province, clans in Hyuga Province, and the Satsuma clan. However, each of these three areas had own unique features in the expression of the face value (including gin [silver] coin-based, or zeni [copper or iron] coin-based) and the design of their Han-satsu. It is considered that, from the face value describing in zeni base and the design on the face, the Hatamoto-satsu issued by the Mera clan was deeply affected by the Han-satsu issued by clans in Hyuga Province. </p>
