<h1>Migyosho (御教書)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>A Migyosho (or Mikyosho) was a form of ancient document issued by a <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Keishi (household superintendent).html">Keishi</a> (household superintendant) with a court rank of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Jusanmi.html">Jusanmi</a> (Junior Third Rank) or higher used for conveying the intentions of their masters from the late Heian period to the Muromachi period. Documents with the same style issued by <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Keishi (household superintendent).html">Keishi</a> or Kaboku (servant) of nobilities with a rank lower than <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Jusanmi.html">Jusanmi</a> or Shugodaimyo (military governor) used for conveying their masters' intention was called hosho. </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>As a matter of formality, Migyosho were written in the same style as <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Rinji (the Emperors command).html">Rinji</a> (Imperial order), <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Inzen (a decree from the retired Emperor).html">Inzen</a> (decree from the Retired Emperor) and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Ryoji.html">Ryoji</a> (orders issued by princes, empresses etc.). Although they were written in the style of a private letter, they were customarily written by a <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Keishi (household superintendent).html">Keishi</a> since it was common for those with high rank to have their close aides write on their behalf. As a result, the sender was also a <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Keishi (household superintendent).html">Keishi</a> and the master would add their sodeban (signature) when necessary. 
<br/>At the end of one of these documents, a phrase emphasizing that a letter was written in accordance with the intention of a master was added, such as, 'The statements above were made by him/her.'<br/>
</p>
<p>As a Migyosho was a notice or emergency order, its status as a document was inferior to a Kudashibumi (a document issued by a superior or office), which was an official document and effective indefinitely as a court ruling, license proof, etc. <h3>History</h3>
</p>
<p>The oldest Migyosho still in existence was issued by <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/FUJIWARA no Tadazane.html">FUJIWARA no Tadazane</a> on November 25, 1116. 
<br/>Migyosho issued by the head of the Sekke (the top five Fujiwara families whose members were eligible for the positions of Sessho and Kanpaku) were called 'Denka Migyosho.'<br/>
</p>
<p>Minamoto no Yoritomo established the base of bukeyo monjo (a samurai-style document) which consisted of three kinds of documents; these were the Kudashibumi, Gejijo (a document issued by a vassal of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> for conveying <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> orders) and Migyosho. Documents issued by Yoritomo prior to his promotion to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Junii (Junior Second Rank).html">Junii</a> (Junior Second Rank) on June 4, 1185, however, were called hosho. After the death of Yoritomo, the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>) used Migyosho as the method for passing on information of official intentions. The frequency in which Migyosho were used gradually increased as the use of Kudashibumi and Gejijo decreased. </p>
<p>During the Muromachi period, Migyosho drove out Kudashibumi as well as Gejijo and became the highest ranking document style among documents issued by the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>. However, as <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Gonaisho.html">Gonaisho</a> (an official document) adopted the style of Jikijo (a private document) and came to be more wildey used, Migyosho gradually fell into disuse. </p>
<p>In emphasis of the fact that <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Yoshimitsu ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshimitsu ASHIKAGA</a> was conferred the title of '<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/King of Japan (Nihon Kokuo).html">King of Japan</a>' by the Emperor of Ming, Akira IMATANI called Yoshimitsu's Migyosho 'Migyosho of a King.'<br/>
