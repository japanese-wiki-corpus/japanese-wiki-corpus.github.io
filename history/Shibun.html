<p>Shibun was the term for persons with the full social rank as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bushi.html">bushi</a> (warrior) class among the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bushi.html">bushi</a> during the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Edo Period.html">Edo Period</a>. Also called Shikaku. In general, they were officially allowed to have a family name and carry swords. 
<br/><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Myojitaito.html">Myojitaito</a> (being permitted to adopt a surname and wear a pair of swords)<br/>
</p>
<p>In some domains, retainers were classified into 3 classes, '<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Joshi (upper-class samurai).html">Joshi</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kachi.html">Kachi</a>, Sotsu or <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Ashigaru.html">Ashigaru</a>,' but the top two classes (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Kishi.html">Kishi</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kachi.html">Kachi</a>) were considered Shibun. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Kishi.html">Kishi</a> (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Joshi (upper-class samurai).html">Joshi</a>) were upper class <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bushi.html">bushi</a> who were allowed to ride horses and, for example, in the case of the Hiroshima domain, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bushi.html">bushi</a> who were given more than one hundred koku were considered to belong to this class. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kachi.html">Kachi</a> (Kashi) were lower class <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bushi.html">bushi</a> who were not officially allowed to ride horses, and Sotsu were in principle foot soldiers, and this was the term for <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Ashigaru.html">Ashigaru</a> (common foot soldier). <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Kishi.html">Kishi</a> with a fief and vassals were allowed to have an audience with the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a>, whereas <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kachi.html">Kachi</a> were given kuramai (rice preserved in a depository by Edo Shogunate and domains) and were not allowed to have an audience with the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a>, and in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>), <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Hatamoto (direct retainers of shogun).html">Hatamoto</a> corresponded to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Kishi.html">Kishi</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Gokenin.html">Gokenin</a> corresponded to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kachi.html">Kachi</a>. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Ashigaru.html">Ashigaru</a> and below were called 'Keihai' (a person of low rank) and were not considered Shibun, so there was a large difference between the two. </p>
<p>Below the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Ashigaru.html">Ashigaru</a> class were servants of a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bushi.html">bushi</a> family called Chugen (rank below common soldier), Komono (a lower servant) who were privately hired by Shibun. Some <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Ashigaru.html">Ashigaru</a> were allowed <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Myojitaito.html">Myojitaito</a>, and depending upon their achievements, some were allowed to rise to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kachi.html">Kachi</a>, but Chugen and below were never allowed such privileges and there was a clear boundary between these two as well. Domain constituents (retainers) strictly indicated those that had Shibun, and even in a wide definition may have included <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Ashigaru.html">Ashigaru</a>, but Chugen and Komono were never considered retainers. </p>
<p>Some commoners who helped domain finances or were wealthy merchants were given Shibun and allowed <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Myojitaito.html">Myojitaito</a>. There were differences such as privileges for one generation only or for all subsequent generations, only family names or only carrying swords. Because it would have been difficult distinguish between houses if farmers and townspeople had no family name, the unofficial practice of using landmarks etc. as family names was common. </p>
<p>Among the 47 Akaho warriors, only Kichiemon TERASAKA was not Shibun but <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Ashigaru.html">Ashigaru</a> class. The custom at that time was that only people of Shibun were allowed <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Seppuku.html">Seppuku</a> (suicide by disembowelment) and Zanshu (beheading) was for <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Ashigaru.html">Ashigaru</a> upon execution. Kuranosuke OISHI thought this was unfortunate and was said to let Kichiemon TERASAKA be the messenger and survive after the raid. </p>
<p>After the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Meiji Restoration (Meiji-ishin).html">Meiji Restoration</a>, Shibun became Shizoku and Sotsu were taken into <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Sotsuzoku (low-ranking samurai).html">Sotsuzoku</a>, but later hereditary Sotsu became Shizoku and one generation only Sotsu were considered commoners. </p>
