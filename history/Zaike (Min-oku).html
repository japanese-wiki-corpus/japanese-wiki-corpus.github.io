<h1>Zaike (Min-oku) (在家 (民屋))</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Zaike was a house, and the cultivated land and residents belonging to the house. It was also used as a unit (Zaikeyaku) for collecting taxes (land tax, public duties, labor services) within <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> (landed estates) or koryo (public lands). </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>Under the tax collection system established in the Medieval period taxes relating to public duties and labor services, which were kinds of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Zoyaku.html">zoyaku</a> (odd-jobs tasks), were assessed for <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Myoden.html">myoden</a> (rice field lots) as a collection unit; on the other hand, taxes relating to public duties and labor services were collected in regions where <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Myoden.html">myoden</a> had not sufficiently established or from people who did not belong to the ruling system of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> (manor) and koryo (mainly non-cultivators) (mostly non-farmer), such as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kugonin.html">kugonin</a> (groups of producer-merchants) or jinin (shrine dependents) by assessing for zaike as a collection unit. Particularly, in Togoku (eastern Japan) and Kyushu where zaichi ryoshu (local proprietors) became similar to Nanushi (village headmen) and Hyakusho-myo (smaller holdings of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> held by ordinary peasants) were not established, many Zaikeyaku were levied. Zaike could be categorized as slaves similar to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Genin (Low ranked people).html">genin</a> (the base) and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shoju.html">shoju</a> (followers); but, zaike was considered differently in each region, and besides, there was no record indicating that ryoshu in fact controlled zaike. Zaike were confirmed through kenchu (land survey) and taxes were equally assessed in principle; zaike which were fixed to the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kenchucho.html">kenchucho</a> (land survey ledger) were called honzaike (main zaike), and newly added zaike were called waki zaike (branch zaike) or shin zaike (new zaike). </p>
