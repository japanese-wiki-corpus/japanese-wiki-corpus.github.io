<h1>Kyotoshi (筥陶司)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kyotoshi (Vessels Office) was one of the institutions belonging to Kunaisho (Ministry of the Sovereign's Household) in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ritsuryo.html">Ritsuryo</a> system (a system of centralized government based on the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ritsuryo.html">ritsuryo</a> code). 
<br/>The Japanese way of reading is 'Hakosue no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Tsukasa (a rank in government offices).html">tsukasa</a>.'<br/>
In <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Taiho Ritsuryo (Taiho Code).html">Taiho Ritsuryo</a> (Taiho Code), it might be called 'Kyokeshi.'<br/>
</p>
<p><h3>Official duties</h3>
</p>
<p>Kyotoshi managed and produced mainly the dinnerware and containers such as earthenware, wooden product, box and so on as its official duty. "Hako" is considered as a round box made with bamboo and hakohe, who was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Zakko (Special Technicians).html">Zakko</a> (special technicians), produced wooden product and bamboo product. However, as for earthenware, a special <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Zakko (Special Technicians).html">Zakko</a> did not belong to this. </p>
<p>It is known that Kyotoshi existed as suetsukuribe before <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ritsuryo.html">Ritsuryo</a> system, but it is unknown that Kyotoshi was born because of the spread of producing technique of earthenware or not, and for years to come, except for the special containers used for ritual and so on, the government is considered to have stopped producing earthenware and it is not sure what happened to suetsukuribe under the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ritsuryo.html">Ritsuryo</a> system. The theories of existing official documents or scholars of the law in "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ryonoshuge (Commentaries on the Civil Statutes).html">Ryonoshuge</a>" (Commentaries on the Civil Statutes) says that earthenwares, used in the Imperial Court or government officials except for special earthenwares used for rituals, were provided by tributes of cho (tributes) and nenryo zakki (ware paid as a tribute) or <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shozei (the rice tax stored in provincial offices warehouse).html">shozei</a> koeki (provision by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shozei (the rice tax stored in provincial offices warehouse).html">shozei</a> [the rice tax stored in provincial offices' warehouse]) and kyotoshi is considered to have only managed and done cashier job for earthenwares collected in the central government. </p>
<p>It was incorporated into <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Daizenshiki (Office of the Palace Table).html">Daizenshiki</a> (Office of the Palace Table) in 808. <h3>Personnel</h3>
