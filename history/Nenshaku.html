<h1>Nenshaku (年爵)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The term Nenshaku means the right to confer a court rank on a person that was granted to chiten no kimi (the Retired Emperor in power) and sangu (the Three Empresses : Great Empress Dowager, Empress Dowager and Empress) in Japan's ancient/early medieval period. Each of the chiten and sangu was given every year the right to confer a court rank on one person and allowed to confer the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Jugoi (Junior Fifth Rank) (a rank in Japan).html">Jugoi</a> (Junior Fifth Rank) on one of the applicants in return for a payment of joryo (a fee for attaining a court rank). This system started in the early Heian period and later, the privilege of nenshaku was also granted to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Nyoin (a close female relative of the Emperor or a womwan of comparable standing).html">nyoin</a> (close female relatives of the Emperor or a woman of comparative standing) and jugo (honorable rank next to the three empresses). </p>
<p>This system was originally the sale of court rank, like the system of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Eishaku (an honorable position or rank).html">eishaku</a> under which temples/shrines and guji (chief of those who serves shrine) were conferred court ranks in return for a payment of joryo. In the end of the Heian period and the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period however, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Shojo.html">shojo</a> (promotion) (kakai (promotion)) using the nenshaku system became popular. </p>
