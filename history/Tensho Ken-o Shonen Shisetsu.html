<h1>Tensho Ken-o Shonen Shisetsu (天正遣欧少年使節)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Tensho Ken-o Shonen Shisetsu was a mission of four boys and others dispatched to Rome in 1582, acting for Yoshishige OTOMO, Sumitada OMURA, and Harunobu ARIMA, who were the Christian feudal lords in Kyushu. This mission was suggested by the Jesuit, Alessandro Valignano. They returned to Japan in 1590. The mission made the existence of Japan known among the European people and Japanese documents were printed for the first time with a printing press that Johannes Gutenberg brought back (this is called Jesuit printing). </p>
<p><h3>Purpose</h3>
</p>
<p>Valignano explained the purpose of the mission in his own letter as follows:<br/>
</p>
<p>First, to ask the Pope and both kings in Spain and Portugal for financial and spiritual support for missionaries to Japan. </p>
<p>Second, have the Japanese see, hear, and experience the Christian world in Europe so that the boys could tell of its glory and greatness after returning to Japan, which would be useful for propagation. <h3>Members of the mission</h3>

<p>The mission boys were selected among students learning at seminario (seminary). </p>
