<p><h3>China</h3>
</p>
<p>In China, the policies that were carried out in lords' countries at the Spring and Autumn period and the Warring States period were called 'Fukoku kyohei', and some examples were given in Shinsaku (Qin strategies) of "Sengoku (warlike period) strategies". In this period each country appointed thinkers called Shoshi-hyakka (general term of scholars and schools in China), and they introduced new weapons, such as Cavalry Operations and chariots, and conducted military reforms. <h3>Japan</h3>
</p>
<p>It is a basic national policy of the Meiji government in Japan. Japan, which fell far behind the Western powers due to its national isolation policy in the Edo era, was heavily burdened by the Ansei Five-Power Treaties long after its start as a renewed nation. Learning a lesson from this, Japan aimed to revise the treaties and improve national security by strengthening its economic power with land-tax reform and encouragement of industries (national enrichment), and military power with the conscription system and reformation of the military system (strengthening of the military) to catch up with other great powers. </p>
