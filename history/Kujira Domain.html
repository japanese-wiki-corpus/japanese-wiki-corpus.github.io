<h1>Kujira Domain (櫛羅藩)</h1>
<p>Kujira Domain was a feudal domain that was located in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yamato Province.html">Yamato Province</a> (present-day Kujira, Gose City, Nara Prefecture)<br/>
The seat of government was Kujira <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Jinya.html">jinya</a> (regional government office)<br/>
</p>
<p><h3>History of the domain</h3>
</p>
<p>The domain was founded in 1863, when Naotaka NAGAI, the eighth lord of Yamato Shinjo Domain, moved the government office to Kujira, as a result of the reform of the Sankinkotai (a system under which feudal lords in the Edo period were required to spend every other year in residence in Edo) implemented by the shogunate as part of its <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bunkyu Reform.html">Bunkyu Reform</a>. It is believed that the move was prompted by Kujira being the most prosperous and key area in the domain. Naotaka encouraged the domain population to move and to form clusters and renamed the domain Kujira but died on October 8, 1865, succeeded by Naochika NAGAI. Naochika entered the domain in April of the following year, as the first lord of the domain, but his role as feudal domain lord was cut short by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Meiji Restoration (Meiji-ishin).html">Meiji Restoration</a>. With Hanseki <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Hokan (Professional entertainer).html">Hokan</a> (the return of land and population to rule by the Emperor) on August 1, 1869, Naochika became governor of Kujira Domain, and the domain was abolished along with others in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Haihan-chiken (abolition of feudal domains and establishment of prefectures).html">Haihan-chiken</a> (abolition of domains and establishment of prefectures) on August 29, 1871. </p>
