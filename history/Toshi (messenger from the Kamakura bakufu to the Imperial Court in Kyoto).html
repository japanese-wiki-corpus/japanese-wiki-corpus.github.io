<h1>Toshi (messenger from the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> to the Imperial Court in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>) (東使)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Toshi, also known as Kanto-onshi, is a messenger dispatched from the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>) to Imperial Court in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Rokuhara Tandai (an administrative and judicial agency in Rokuhara, Kyoto).html">Rokuhara Tandai</a> (the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> deputy in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>) or to Kanto-moshitsugi (liaison officer mediating between the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> and the Imperial Court), etc. and was employed for communication of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>'s opinions of issues of special political importance to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. 
<br/>(However, the term could also be used on messengers dispatched by the Imperial Court to the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a>.)<br/>
</p>
<p>For this reason, the toshi made frequent trips between <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> in important political developments, such as accession of a new Emperor (appearing frequently in documents such as "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Masukagami (The Clear Mirror).html">Masukagami</a>" (The Clear Mirror) that records activities in the Imperial Court at that time). Depending on the issue, the toshi was able to pass over the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Rokuhara Tandai (an administrative and judicial agency in Rokuhara, Kyoto).html">Rokuhara Tandai</a> and negotiate directly with the Court, or sometimes it was granted the authority to issue orders directly to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Rokuhara Tandai (an administrative and judicial agency in Rokuhara, Kyoto).html">Rokuhara Tandai</a>. </p>
<p>The toshi was very often selected from specific families of shogunal retainers well versed in the literary art and in imperial protocol, such as the Nagai, Nikaido and Adachi clans. In addition, the toshi could at times be accompanied by a vassal of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/family/Tokuso.html">Tokuso</a> (the patrimonial head of the main branch of the Hojo clan) and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shikken (regent for the shogun).html">Shikken</a> (shogunal <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Regent.html">regent</a>). </p>
