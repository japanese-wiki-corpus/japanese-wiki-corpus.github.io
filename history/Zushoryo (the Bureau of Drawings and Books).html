<h1>Zushoryo (the Bureau of Drawings and Books) (図書寮)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Zushoryo was one of the institutions belonging to Nakatsukasasho (Ministry of Central Affairs) in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ritsuryo.html">Ritsuryo</a> system (a system of centralized government based on the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ritsuryo.html">ritsuryo</a> code) in Japan. And in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Imperial Household Agency.html">Imperial Household Agency</a> after the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period, the institution of the same name institution was set up. </p>
<p><h3>Official duties</h3>
</p>
<p>The first official duty of Zushoryo was to control the state's library and it played a role of national library. Additionally, it also controlled the scriptures of Confucianism and Buddhism and Buddha statues and so on. For assisting the administrative work, shashoshu who copied books or sokoshu who did bookbinding belonged to this. Furthermore, the work of compiling history books was also one of the official duties, as described in the "Yoro <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ritsuryo.html">ritsuryo</a> code" (code promulgated in the Yoro period). In the actual work of compiling history books, the office work was done by establishing the institution (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Senkokushisho (History Compilation Bureau).html">Senkokushisho</a> [History Compilation Bureau]) (and official documents and records which were necessary for compiling history books were collected in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Naiki (government posts).html">Naiki</a> [secretary of the Ministry of Central Affairs] or Geki [Secretary of the Grand Council of State], which was the reason why Zushoryo did not involve with the work of compiling history books). Also, during the Heian period the administration of library was taken over to the institutions such as Gosho-dokoro (an office to maintain books in the Imperial Court), Uchi no goshodokoro(the place that keeps Emperor's books), Ippon-goshodokoro and so on and lost substance. </p>
<p>The second official duty of Zushoryo was to produce paper, ink, ink brush and so on.
