<p><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Genko (Mongol invasion).html">Genko</a> no Ran was an anti-Kamakura <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> movement broke out in 1331. The movement was driven by the powers that had gathered together with <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Go-Daigo.html">Emperor Go-Daigo</a> as the central figure. References to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Genko (Mongol invasion).html">Genko</a> no Ran often include a series of conflicts fought until the fall of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kamakura Bakufu.html">Kamakura Bakufu</a> (shogunate government) in 1333. The conflicts from 1331 to 1333 are described below. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Genko (Mongol invasion).html">Genko</a> no Ran is also called <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Genko (Mongol invasion).html">Genko</a> no Hen. </p>
<p><h3>Background</h3>
</p>
<p>In the late <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period, the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/family/Tokuso.html">Tokuso</a> family of the Hojo clan exercised authority over the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>. The Hojo family significantly increased its fiefdoms. Contrastingly, an increasing number of those in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Gokenin.html">gokenin</a> (immediate vassals of the shogunate) stratum were ruined because of the burden imposed on them by ikoku-keigoban-yaku (a kind of military service imposed on the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Gokenin.html">gokenin</a> in which they had to guard areas other than those they usually guarded), which continued even after the Mongolian expeditions against Japan; delays to the provision of rewards and settlement of lawsuits following the Mongolian expeditions; the gradual emergence of a monetary economy; and the division of their territory. The shogunate government coped with the matter by issuing the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Tokuseirei.html">Tokuseirei</a> (ordering the return of land sold and the dissolution of debts), but society remained in chaos. That activated <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Akuto.html">Akuto</a> (a villain of the medieval times) in the respective provinces, and gradually the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> lost support. </p>
<p>After the late thirteenth century, the Imperial Court adopted the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Ryoto (a formal dress for ancient military officers).html">ryoto</a> tetsuritsu system, a system in which succession to the imperial throne alternated between the two ancestral lines of the imperial family: <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Gofukakusa.html">Emperor Gofukakusa</a> (the Jimyoin line) and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Kameyama.html">Emperor Kameyama</a> (the Daikakuji line). That led to disruption among the Imperial nobles, by which they became factionalized according to the supporting imperial lines. The disruption hindered the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> from controlling the Imperial Court. </p>
<p>In 1318, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Go-Daigo.html">Emperor Go-Daigo</a> from the Daikakuji line acceded to the throne. Emperor Godaigo espoused the ideal of direct administration by the Emperor, but he harbored the aim of overthrowing the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>. The Shochu Conspiracy of 1324 was prevented by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Rokuhara Tandai (an administrative and judicial agency in Rokuhara, Kyoto).html">Rokuhara Tandai</a> (an administrative and judicial agency in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Rokuhara.html">Rokuhara</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>). Godaigo vindicated himself to the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> and was pardoned, but his close adviser <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Suketomo HINO.html">Suketomo HINO</a> was exiled to Sadoga-shima Island. Godaigo resumed his plan to overthrow the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> with his close adviser <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Toshimoto HINO.html">Toshimoto HINO</a>, who had been exempted from punishment, and a monk called <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Monkan.html">Monkan</a> from the Shingon-shu sect of Tantric Buddhism. <h3>Battle of Mount Kasagi and Akasaka-jo Castle</h3>
</p>
<p>In August 1331, Godaigo's close adviser <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Sadafusa YOSHIDA.html">Sadafusa YOSHIDA</a> informed <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Rokuhara Tandai (an administrative and judicial agency in Rokuhara, Kyoto).html">Rokuhara Tandai</a> of the plan to overthrow the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>. The plan was revealed again. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Rokuhara Tandai (an administrative and judicial agency in Rokuhara, Kyoto).html">Rokuhara Tandai</a> sent the army into the Imperial Palace. Godaigo escaped from the Imperial Palace in women's clothing and pretended to head for Mount Hiei. Godaigo was in fact at Mount Kasagi in Yamashiro Province (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>), and there he raised an army. Following this, Godaigo's son <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Imperial Prince Morinaga.html">Imperial Prince Morinaga</a> raised an army in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Yoshino.html">Yoshino</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Yamato Province.html">Yamato Province</a>, while at the same time <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Masashige KUSUNOKI.html">Masashige KUSUNOKI</a>, a villain from Kawachi Province, raised an army at Shimo Akasaka-jo Castle in Kawachi Province. </p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> dispatched the punitive force that had been formed by Sadanao OSARAGI, Sadafuyu KANAZAWA, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Takauji ASHIKAGA.html">Takauji ASHIKAGA</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshisada NITTA.html">Yoshisada NITTA</a>. In September, Mount Kasagi fell (the battle of Mount Kasagi), and subsequently <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Yoshino.html">Yoshino</a> fell. Only Shimo Akasaka -jo Castle, defended by the army of Kusunoki, survived. Here, the army of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> was forced into a hard fight. The army of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> scaled the wall of Shimo Akasaka-jo Castle while the army of Kusunoki employed unprecedented tactics against the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> army, such as throwing enormous trees down onto them, pouring boiling water over them, and collapsing the outer layer of the two-layered wall to which they were clinging. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Masashige KUSUNOKI.html">Masashige KUSUNOKI</a>, however, knew he couldn't afford a prolonged resistance. In October, he set fire to Shimo Akasaka -jo Castle by himself and pretended to commit suicide, and then vanished (the battle of Akasaka-jo Castle). </p>
<p>Godaigo was arrested by the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> together with his close adviser, Tadaaki CHIKUSA. The <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> enthroned the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Kogen.html">Emperor Kogen</a> from the Jimyoin line and changed the imperial era name to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shokei (court novels who work at the Imperial Court in high ranking posts).html">Shokei</a>. In March, 1332, the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> beheaded <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Toshimoto HINO.html">Toshimoto HINO</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Tomoyuki KITABATAKE.html">Tomoyuki KITABATAKE</a> as well as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Suketomo HINO.html">Suketomo HINO</a>, who had been in exile, and exiled Godaigo to Okino-shima island. The anti-bakufu movement seemed to be suppressed in this way. <h3>Battle of Chihaya-jo Castle</h3>
</p>
<p>Prince Morinaga and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Masashige KUSUNOKI.html">Masashige KUSUNOKI</a> hid and waited for the right moment. In November 1332, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Masashige KUSUNOKI.html">Masashige KUSUNOKI</a> raised an army at Chihaya-jo Castle in Mount Kongo, in Kawachi Province (Highland Kongo). In the same month, Prince Morinaga also raised an army in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Yoshino.html">Yoshino</a> and issued <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Ryoji.html">ryoji</a> (order issued by a prince, etc.) to overthrow the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>. In December, Masashige regained Akasaka-jo Castle. In January 1333, he defeated the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Rokuhara Tandai (an administrative and judicial agency in Rokuhara, Kyoto).html">Rokuhara Tandai</a> army at Tenno-ji Temple in Settsu Province, etc. </p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> again dispatched a large army led by Ietoki OSARAGI, Munenori NAGOE (or NAGOSHI), and Takanao OSARAGI. First, the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> army headed for Kami-Akasaka-jo Castle, which was being defended by the Masashige vassal Shogen HIRANO. Kami-Akasaka-jo Castle had strong defenses that forced the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> army to engage in a bitter fight, but the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> army cut off the water supply to the castle in order that Shogen HIRANO would be forced to surrender. At the same time, the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> army defeated Prince Morinaga in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Yoshino.html">Yoshino</a>. </p>
<p>However, Chihaya-jo Castle remained undefeated, and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Masashige KUSUNOKI.html">Masashige KUSUNOKI</a> remained inside with a small number of soldiers. The Kusunoki army then gave the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> army another drubbing by employing the novel strategy of shooting arrows from among straw figures dressed in armor that acted as decoys. The <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> army attempted to cut off the castle's water supply. The Kusunoki army, however, maintained a water source in Chihaya-jo Castle and was therefore undaunted. A portion of the Kusunoki army charged, attempting a surprise attack on the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> army. The Kusunoki army snatched the color from the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> army, displayed it on the castle wall, and made fun of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> army. The Kusunoki army had fought through 90 days against the larger <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> army. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, on receiving the news that, despite having been engaged in fighting to take Chihaya-jo Castle for such a long time, the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> army had yet to take control of it, the feeling that the time was ripe to overthrow the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> spread throughout the provinces of Japan. <h3>The Occupation of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Rokuhara.html">Rokuhara</a></h3>
</p>
<p>In Harima Province, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Norimura AKAMATSU.html">Norimura AKAMATSU</a> (Enshin) raised an army, and revolts occurred in other areas. Among others, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Norimura AKAMATSU.html">Norimura AKAMATSU</a> had great power to storm <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> by rallying the Godaigo armies. Having seen the circumstances, in leap February Godaigo escaped from Oki no shima Island with the aid of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Nagatoshi NAWA.html">Nagatoshi NAWA</a>. Then, Godaigo reached Mount Senjo in Hoki Province and issued a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Rinji (the Emperors command).html">rinji</a> (the Emperor's command) for the nation to overthrow the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>. </p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> dispatched reinforcements led by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Takauji ASHIKAGA.html">Takauji ASHIKAGA</a> and Takaie NAGOE to defeat the combatants at Mount Senjo. On April 27, Takaie NAGOE was defeated by Enshin AKAMATSU. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Takauji ASHIKAGA.html">Takauji ASHIKAGA</a> rose in revolt against the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> at Shinomura-Hachimangu Shrine in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Tanba Province.html">Tanba Province</a>, which was a shoryo (territory). On May 7, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Takauji ASHIKAGA.html">Takauji ASHIKAGA</a> defeated <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Rokuhara Tandai (an administrative and judicial agency in Rokuhara, Kyoto).html">Rokuhara Tandai</a> in cooperation with <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Doyo SASAKI.html">Doyo SASAKI</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Norimura AKAMATSU.html">Norimura AKAMATSU</a> and the like, and conquered <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. The families and followers of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Rokuhara Tandai (an administrative and judicial agency in Rokuhara, Kyoto).html">Rokuhara Tandai</a>, including <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Nakatoki HOJO.html">Nakatoki HOJO</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Tokimasu HOJO.html">Tokimasu HOJO</a>, attempted to escape to Togoku (the eastern part of Japan, particularly the Kanto region). On May 9, they committed suicide with their swords at <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Renge-ji Temple (Sakyo-ku Ward, Kyoto City).html">Renge-ji Temple</a> in Banba of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Omi Province.html">Omi Province</a>, and the emperors Kogen, Gofushimi and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Hanazono (Kyoto City).html">Hanazono</a> were arrested. <h3>The Occupation of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a></h3>
</p>
<p>On May 8, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshisada NITTA.html">Yoshisada NITTA</a> raised an army at Ikushina-jinja Shrine in Kozuke Province. The Nitta army pushed southward across the Tonegawa River while increasing the number of soldiers by rallying the clan and neighboring <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Gokenin.html">gokenin</a>. Senjuo, the legitimate son of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Takauji ASHIKAGA.html">Takauji ASHIKAGA</a> (later <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshiakira ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshiakira ASHIKAGA</a>), also joined the Nitta army. Thus it is said that the Nitta army grew to a number in the tens of thousands. The <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> dispatched the army led by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/family/Yasuie HOJO.html">Yasuie HOJO</a> to intercept the enemy. The <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> army was defeated at the battles of Kotesashi ga hara and Bubaigawara (the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period), and was cornered in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a>. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> was attacked from three directions, with the Nitta army attacking from the Gokurakji-saka and the Kobukuro-zaka and the army of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshisada NITTA.html">Yoshisada NITTA</a> and his younger brother Yoshisuke WAKIYA attacking from the Kesho-zaka. The natural fortress of the kiridoshi in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> offered strong defenses. Muneuji OTACHI (or ODACHI), of the Nitta army, was killed in the battle of Gokurakji-saka. The battle was temporarily in a stalemate. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshisada NITTA.html">Yoshisada NITTA</a> devised a plan and outmaneuvered the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> army by charging <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> from Inamura ga saki. On May 22 the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> army fell, and the HOJO family, including <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Takatoki HOJO.html">Takatoki HOJO</a>, fell at Toshoji-Temple (Toshoji Gassen (Tosho-ji War)). The chinzei <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Tandai.html">tandai</a> (the military governor of Kyushu) <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Hidetoki HOJO.html">Hidetoki HOJO</a> was also attacked by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Sadatsune SHONI.html">Sadatsune SHONI</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Sadamune OTOMO.html">Sadamune OTOMO</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Sadahisa SHIMAZU.html">Sadahisa SHIMAZU</a>, and on May 25 he committed suicide with his sword in Hakata. <h3>Influences</h3>

<p>Emperor Godaigo's anti-bakufu movement had succeeded after all. Godaigo returned to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, and restored the imperial era under the name of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Genko (Mongol invasion).html">Genko</a>. Godaigo launched the Kenmu Restoration, which was the direct imperial rule that Godaigo had long envisioned. The granting of rewards after the examination of services for the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Genko (Mongol invasion).html">Genko</a> no Ran was unfair, however. While Godaigo's close advisers were favored, many of those in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> stratum, including <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Norimura AKAMATSU.html">Norimura AKAMATSU</a>, were treated coldly. That treatment undermined the support for the new administration. Accordingly, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Takauji ASHIKAGA.html">Takauji ASHIKAGA</a> became alienated from Godaigo and established the Muromachi <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>. </p>
