<h1>The Hokke Ikki (Hokke Riot) (法華一揆)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The "Hokke Ikki" is the religious riot which occurred in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Sengoku Period (period of warring states) (Japan).html">Sengoku Period</a> (Period of Warring States) around 1532, in Japan. 
<br/>It is called 'Tenmon-honan' by the Nichiren sect, and is also generally called 'Tenmon-horan.'<br/>
</p>
<p>At that time in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, the Nichiren-sect faith became widespread among the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Machi-shu.html">Machi-shu</a> (an elite group of businessmen and artisans) around the Nichiren-sect temples (such as Rokujo <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Honkoku-ji Temple.html">Honkoku-ji Temple</a>). The sect attained great power and influence. In 1532, a rumor spread that the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Jodo Shinshu.html">Jodo Shinshu</a> sect were coming to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. The Nichiren-sect followers of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Machi-shu.html">Machi-shu</a> joined up with the military power of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Harumoto HOSOKAWA.html">Harumoto HOSOKAWA</a> and set fire to the Ikko sect temples. In particular, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Yamashina Hongan-ji Temple.html">Yamashina Hongan-ji Temple</a> was the headquarters of the Ikko sect which had Jinai-cho (the temple town) and the monastery enclosed by earthen walls at the Yamashina basin over the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Higashiyama (Kyoto Prefecture).html">Higashiyama</a>. It was burnt down in this fire. </p>
<p>Later followers of the Nichiren-sect gained autonomy for guarding the inside of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>. They expanded their power in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> over approximately 5 years. 
<br/>They did so through acts such as refusing the delivery of Jishisen (the land taxes paid by tenant farmers.)<br/>
</p>
<p>However, a follower of the Nichiren-sect (Hisayosi MATSUMOTO), refuted the preaching of the Hieizan Western tower's priest, and triggered the priest-soldier army of the Tendai sect Hieizan to start destroying the 'Hokke Ikki' in July, 1536 (old lunar calendar). All followers of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Enryaku-ji Temple.html">Enryaku-ji Temple</a> (also referred to as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Sanmon (large triple gate to temple).html">Sanmon</a>) gathered together and demanded that the 21 temples of Rakuchu-Hokke, in and around the capital <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, become branch temples of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Enryaku-ji Temple.html">Enryaku-ji Temple</a>. (At that time, prominent temples were in control and made small or medium temples of other sects become their branch temples. 
<br/>They did so by forcing them to pay money in return for allowing them to continue to be within their present sects.)<br/>
However, when this was rejected, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Enryaku-ji Temple.html">Enryaku-ji Temple</a> sought permission for the subjugation of the Hokke sect from the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Gonara.html">Emperor Gonara</a>. This was done while making alliances with the opposing Enjo-ji, To-ji, Kofuku-ji and Hongan-ji Temples and staying neutral. Then, approximately 60,000 monk soldiers advanced on to the city of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, and the 21 head temples of the Nichiren sect, inside and outside of the capital <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, were burnt down (Tenmon Hokke no Ran or War of Tenmon Hokke). Furthermore, the initial fire caused a larger fire, which is said damaged an area of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> surpassing the damage done in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Onin War.html">Onin War</a>. Due to this the period of prosperity of the Nichiren sect ended, and its followers were deported from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. Six years after this, the Nichiren sect became a prohibited religion in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. In 1542, an imperial sanction allowed them to return to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, and later, the 15 head temples of Nichiren sect were rebuilt. </p>
