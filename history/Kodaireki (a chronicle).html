<h1>Kodaireki (a chronicle) (皇代暦)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kodaireki is a chronicle written between the Period of Northern and Southern Courts and the Muromachi period. The author was <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Kinkata TOIN.html">Kinkata TOIN</a>. Later, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Chikanaga KANROJI.html">Chikanaga KANROJI</a> augmented it to form the edition as it is today. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Mitsukuni TOKUGAWA.html">Mitsukuni TOKUGAWA</a> gave it the name Rekidaikoki in the Edo period. </p>
<p>It describes the history from immemorial times to 1477, the Bunmei era under the rein of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Gotsuchimikado.html">Emperor Gotsuchimikado</a>. Although its original five-volume edition that was presented to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Gotsuchimikado.html">Emperor Gotsuchimikado</a> from <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Chikanaga KANROJI.html">Chikanaga KANROJI</a> does not survive today, the Imperial Household Archives stores a duplicate copy ('Yanagi genpon' (Yanagi's original copy)) that was transcribed from the original edition by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Norimitsu YANAGIHARA.html">Norimitsu YANAGIHARA</a> in the Edo period. Another edition that had been stored by Tsunatoshi MAEDA of the Kaga domain is now in the Sonkeikaku Library. </p>
<p><h3>Contents</h3>
</p>
<p>According to the five-volume edition that is said to be the unmodified copy of the original one:<br/>
The age of the gods to the era of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Uda.html">Emperor Uda</a><br/>
The era of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Daigo.html">Emperor Daigo</a> to the era of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Horikawa.html">Emperor Horikawa</a><br/>
The era of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Toba.html">Emperor Toba</a> to the era of Emperor Gotoba<br/>
The era of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Tsuchimikado.html">Emperor Tsuchimikado</a> to the era of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Suko.html">Emperor Suko</a><br/>
The era of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Gokogon.html">Emperor Gokogon</a> to the era of Gotsuchimikado<br/>
</p>
<p>There are also a six-volume edition and a seven-volume edition: the fourth volume was split in two for the former; the latter has the separate seventh volume which has excerpts of the uragaki (additional parts) in addition to the former one. </p>
<p>Each page has five columns: the first column has the Emperor's brief biography; the second column has important incidents around the Imperial Palace; the third column has matters about the Retired Emperor, the Crown Prince, the Imperial Prince, the Imperial Princess, and an empress; the fourth and the fifth columns have personnel affairs of important offices such as sessho (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Regent.html">regent</a>), kanpaku (chief adviser to the Emperor), a minister, seii taishogun (literally, "great general who subdues the barbarians"), and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Konoe no daisho.html">Konoe no daisho</a> (Major Captain of the Palace Guards). In the first to the third volumes, the history and appointments of monks in China were added and these parts were called 'uragaki' (additional parts). </p>
<p>The third volume belonging to the first three volumes with uragaki is the original form written by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Kinkata TOIN.html">Kinkata TOIN</a> which is indicated in the page of April 9, 1356 (the first year of the Enbun era) (old calendar) of his own diary "<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Entairyaku.html">Entairyaku</a>", which says he had edited the continuation of Kodaireki, and this continuation is considered to be the fourth volume. Therefore, the first three volumes were written before the Enbun era. </p>
<p>Some unknown people are considered to have taken over to write the continuation after Kinkata's death, but it was <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Chikanaga KANROJI.html">Chikanaga KANROJI</a> who made Kodaireki as it is today. One can see Chikanaga took good care of Kodaireki from his diary "Chikanaga-kyoki" which says he first grabbed this book while evacuating a big fire which occurred in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> in 1476. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Gotsuchimikado.html">Emperor Gotsuchimikado</a>, who later heard of this episode, ordered Chikanaga to give the copy to the Imperial Court, so he added descriptions until his time to present to the Emperor the copy of Kodaireki, which is said to have been the original edition. </p>
