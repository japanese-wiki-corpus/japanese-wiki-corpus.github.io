<h1>Chuko (periodization) (中古 (時代区分))</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Chuko (Middle Ages) is a word used to represent a time period, and is the second of the three words: joko (ancient times), chuko (middle ages), and kinko (early modern age). </p>
<p>Chuko carries the same meaning as the "Middle Ages." In Japanese literary history, the word chuko is used in the 'Chuko <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Rokkasen (six famous poets).html">Rokkasen</a>' (six Japanese poets presented in the prelude of Kokinshu, A Collection of Ancient and Modern Poetry in the early Heian period) and the 'Chuko Sanjurokkasen' (Thirty-six Japanese poets of Nochi no Rokurokusen selected by FUJIWARA no Norikane). Chuko is therefore regarded as a word used to refer to the Heian period (794 - 1192) in Japanese literature. On the other hand, Japanese literature also uses the term 'chusei' to refer to the time period after the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period which has the same meaning as chuko, and the appropriateness of this practice has been questioned. 
<br/>It is for this reason that there is a tendency to avoid the use of the word 'chuko.'<br/>
