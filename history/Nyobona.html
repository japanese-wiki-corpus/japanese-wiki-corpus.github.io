<h1>Nyobona (女房名)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Nyobona was a name that a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Nyobo (a court lady).html">nyobo</a> (a court lady) called herself in attendance. Her master or colleagues called her by her nyobona instead of her real name. Moreover, the formality of the name itself is called nyobona. </p>
<p>From the Heian period to the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period, women's names were rarely listed in genealogy, etc. Therefore, their real names were hardly known no matter how popular they were. </p>
<p>Nyobona is usually created from the title or rank of the household head, such as her father, brother, or husband. For example, Shikibu in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Murasaki Shikibu.html">Murasaki Shikibu</a> was from her father <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Tametoki.html">FUJIWARA no Tametoki</a>'s title Shikibu taijo (Senior Secretary of the Ministry of Ceremonial), and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shonagon (Post in Daijokan).html">Shonagon</a> in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Sei Shonagon.html">Sei Shonagon</a> was from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shonagon (Post in Daijokan).html">shonagon</a> (lesser counselor) (it is said that her brother became <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shonagon (Post in Daijokan).html">shonagon</a>). Moreover, poet Ise's father was the governor of Ise Province, and poet <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Sagami (poet).html">Sagami</a>'s husband was the governor of Sagami Province. However, a word that indicates her trait might be added in order to distinguish from others who has same name. Sei (清) in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Sei Shonagon.html">Sei Shonagon</a> indicated she was from the Kiyohara (清原) clan, and Murasaki (紫) in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Murasaki Shikibu.html">Murasaki Shikibu</a> came from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Murasaki no ue.html">Murasaki no ue</a> (紫の上), a character of her novel "Tale of Genji," according to one view. Moreover, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Izumi Shikibu.html">Izumi Shikibu</a> was made from her husband's title, governor of Izumi Province and her father's title, shikibu taijo. Another example is <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Daini no Sanmi.html">Daini no Sanmi</a> that was made from a combination of her husband's title, dazai no daini (Senior Assistant Governor-General of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Dazai-fu (local government office in Kyushu region).html">Dazai-fu</a> offices) and her own court rank, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Jusanmi.html">jusanmi</a> (junior third court rank). Furthermore, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Koshikibu no Naishi.html">Koshikibu no Naishi</a> was called 'Koshikibu' (small-shikibu) because she and her mother, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Izumi Shikibu.html">Izumi Shikibu</a>, served <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Shoshi.html">FUJIWARA no Shoshi</a>, the second consort of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Ichijo.html">Emperor Ichijo</a>, at the same time. </p>
<p>Moreover, in order to avoid being confused with a person of the same name but of a different generation, the master's family name might be prefixed to the original nyobona of a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Nyobo (a court lady).html">nyobo</a> who shared a name with another family's <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Nyobo (a court lady).html">nyobo</a> or who had made their name as a poet or a novelist. Especially, the custom started in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Insei.html">insei</a> period (period of the government by the Retired Emperor) and became popular. For example, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Yushi Naishinno-ke no Kii.html">Yushi Naishinno-ke no Kii</a>, Baishi Naishinno-ke no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Senji (imperial decree).html">Senji</a> (as known as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Rokujosaiin no senji.html">Rokujosaiin no senji</a>), Taikenmonin Horikawa, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Nijoin no Sanuki.html">Nijoin no Sanuki</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kokamonin no Betto.html">Kokamonin no Betto</a>, Inpumonin no Taifu, and 摂政家丹後 (as known as Gishumonin no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Tango (the Boys Festival).html">Tango</a>) were named in that manner. </p>
