<h1>Jogen no Honan (承元の法難)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Jogen no Honan was an incident where monks following Senju-Nenbutsu (intently praying to Buddha) led by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Honen.html">Honen</a> were suppressed and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Honen.html">Honen</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shinran.html">Shinran</a> and other monks with central roles were exiled throughout the country. </p>
<p>The incident was triggered by a rebellion of the monks of Mt Hiei, who demanded the cessation of Senju-Nenbutsu in 1204. They directed their demand towards the Tendaizasu (chief of Tendaishu) at that time, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Shinsho (Shinjo).html">Shinsho</a>. </p>
<p><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Honen.html">Honen</a> sent 'The Seven Articles of Religious Commandments' with 190 signatures of monk followers to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Enryaku-ji Temple.html">Enryaku-ji Temple</a> and this settled the quarrel with Tendai. </p>
<p>However, in 1205, the decision to cease nenbutsu was decided by a soujo (document reported to the Emperor) from Kofuju-ji Temple in Nanto (Nara Prefecture). On this occasion, the monks of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Kofuku-ji Temple.html">Kofuku-ji Temple</a> sent "The Nine Articles of Religious Negligence" to the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Honen.html">Honen</a> order. </p>
<p>Negligence by starting a new order<br/>
</p>
<p>Negligence by creating new images<br/>
</p>
<p>Negligence by not respecting Shaka<br/>
</p>
<p>Negligence by impeding good deeds<br/>
</p>
<p>Negligence by turning your back towards the gods<br/>
</p>
<p>Negligence by darkening Jodo<br/>
</p>
<p>Negligence by making mistakes during nenbutsu<br/>
</p>
<p>Negligence by losing the followers<br/>
</p>
<p>Negligence by upsetting the country<br/>
</p>
<p>In particular, Anrakubo <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Junsai (Water Shield).html">Junsai</a> and Hohonbo <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Gyoku.html">Gyoku</a> were attacked because of their popularity with Nenbutsu shows which featured a tune similar to the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Rokuji-Raisan.html">Rokuji-Raisan</a> nenbutsu. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Honen.html">Honen</a> excommunicated <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Gyoku.html">Gyoku</a>, but the situation was not resolved. </p>
<p>In 1207, the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> bowed to the demands from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Kofuku-ji Temple.html">Kofuku-ji Temple</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Honen.html">Honen</a> was exiled to Sanuki Province. Again, the Nenbutsu show that <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Junsai (Water Shield).html">Junsai</a> and Juren had held at Shishigatani was considered as a problem. Their beautiful voices entranced the women in Retired Emperor Gotoba's Inner Court to the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Point (Sentoki).html">point</a> that some had their hair shaved and became nuns, angering the Retired Emperor so much that he had the two monks executed and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Honen.html">Honen</a> exiled. 2 other monks were also executed and 7 monks other than <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Honen.html">Honen</a> were exiled. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shinran.html">Shinran</a> was exiled to Echigo Province. </p>
<p><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Honen.html">Honen</a> did not reach Tosa Province, but was forgiven at Sanuki, stayed for a while at Katsuo-ji Temple in Settsu Province and returned to the capital in 1211. </p>
