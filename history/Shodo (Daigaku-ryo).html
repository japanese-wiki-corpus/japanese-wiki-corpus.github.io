<h1>Shodo (<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Daigaku-ryo.html">Daigaku-ryo</a>) (書道 (大学寮))</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Shodo was the study of calligraphy under the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Daigaku-ryo.html">Daigaku-ryo</a> (Bureau of Education) of Japan's <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Ritsuryo.html">Ritsuryo</a> system (a system of centralized government based on the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Ritsuryo.html">ritsuryo</a> code). </p>
<p>It was thought that <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Shosei.html">shosei</a> (students who were given room and board in exchange for performing domestic duties) were taught by sho hakase (professors of calligraphy) but despite the fact that there were regulations regarding <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Shosei.html">shosei</a> in education laws, there were no regulations regarding the fixed number of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Shosei.html">shosei</a> written within the shikiinryo (law which stipulates duties of the ministries) which fixed number of students, and they are thought to have been few in number (an entry in "<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Shoku Nihongi (Chronicle of Japan Continued).html">Shoku Nihongi</a>" (Chronicle of Japan Continued) for December 758 contains an article stating raw silk thread was awarded to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Shosei.html">shosei</a> by <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Junnin.html">Emperor Junnin</a>, so it was not the case that there were not any <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Shosei.html">shosei</a> at all.)<br/>
It appears that the superiority of a <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Shosei.html">shosei</a>'s calligraphy would be judged based on its quality, that the curriculum was simpler than the system of Tang Dynasty China which demanded knowledge of disciplines such as "Shuowen Jiezi" and the formation of characters, and that students who passed examinations were placed in clerical government posts such as that of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Naiki (government posts).html">naiki</a> (secretary of the Ministry of Central Affairs). It also appears to be the case that the main duty of sho hakase was to teach calligraphy (which later became myogyo-do (the study of Confucian classics)) to students. </p>
<p>In the Heian period, the position of sho hakase became monopolized by the Saeki clan of Tado District, Sanuki Province but as demonstrated by the fact that <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Jichie.html">Jichie</a>, who is thought to have been the first To-ji <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Choja.html">choja</a> (the chief abbot of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/To-ji Temple.html">To-ji Temple</a>), studied Confucianism under SAEKI no Sakemaro, sho hakase (although <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Jichie.html">Jichie</a> himself was of the Saeki clan. <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Jichie.html">Jichie</a>'s master <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Kukai.html">Kukai</a>, one of the three famous ancient calligraphers of ancient Japan, was also of the same clan), they took on the role of myogyo-do teachers and Sakemaro's son SAEKI no Toyoo also held the position of engraving official seals (regulations under the "<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Shinto/Engishiki.html">Engishiki</a>" (codes and procedures on national rites and prayers) Department of State codes and Ministry of Central Affairs codes) following the statement that 'owing to his fine seal engraving, he was made a member of the Tengaku Kan' ("<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Nihon Sandai Jitsuroku.html">Nihon Sandai Jitsuroku</a>" (sixth of the six classical Japanese history texts), December 20, 861). In the 11th century, the position of sho hakase became a standby post (a post to which clan members were temporarily appointed until a myogyo-do position became available) for members of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/family/Kiyohara clan.html">Kiyohara clan</a> and Nakahara clan which inherited the position of Myogyo hakase (Professor of Confucian classics), and it is though that shodo completely disappeared as an area of study. </p>
