<h1>Chipped stone tool (打製石器)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Chipped stone tool is a stone tool made with smashed stone without giving a polish. It was mainly used from the Paleolithic era to the Jomon period, but as metal tools came into use in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yayoi period.html">Yayoi period</a>, the number of the stone tools decreased. </p>
<p>It is used in contrast with ground stone tools. </p>
<p>Materials for chipped stone tools include obsidian, sanukite, and shale. </p>
<p><h3>The art of producing chipped stone tools</h3>
</p>
<p>Direct striking: striking a stone at an end with a stone hammer (a striking tool) and flaking unnecessary parts. 
<br/>This technique is used to make the stone in a shape or to make a rough blade,<br/>
</p>
<p>Indirect striking: Not by directly striking stones with hammers but by indirectly striking stones covered with deer's horns or chisel made of animal bones to peel off a piece of stone (called a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Flake.html">flake</a>) and making a stone blade from it. </p>
<p>Pressure-flaking: applying softer striking tools such as deer's horns and bones or wood to the edge of a stone and putting pressure on it to peel off a small piece of stone. This is a close processing technique for making points and microblades. <h3>Changes in chipped stone tools</h3>
</p>
<p>Chipped stone tools changed from small stone tools made just by crushing stones to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Flake.html">flake</a> tools using thin flakes and core tools using the center part of a stone, and finally, microlithes came in use. <h3>Types of chipped stone tool</h3>
</p>
<p>Chipped stone tools in the Paleolithic era are as follows. </p>
<p>Hand ax<br/>
</p>
<p>It is also called akufu and nigiritsuchi. It was used as an almighty tool. </p>
<p>Blade<br/>
</p>
<p>It is also called as sekijin. It was a sharp stone tool used for such purposes as cutting and shaving. </p>
<p><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Point (Sentoki).html">Point</a><br/>
</p>
<p>It is also called sento-ki. It was attached to the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Point (Sentoki).html">point</a> of a pike and mainly used for hunting. </p>
<p>Other types included a scraper, a stone tool resembling a knife, and a chiseling tool. </p>
<p>In Jomon period, various kinds of chipped stone tools, including a stone spoon, a flint of arrowhead, a chipped-stone drill, a stone ax, and a stone pike, were made according to the use. 
<br/>They are all <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Flake.html">flake</a> tools<br/>
In contrast with them, a core tool is a stone left when chipped stone tools are made, and stone tools made with the center part of a stone is called a core tool. </p>
