<h1>Hirata no Sho (平田荘)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Hirata no sho was a manor located in old <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yamato Province.html">Yamato Province</a>. It was the biggest manor in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yamato.html">Yamato</a>, scattered from Katsuge County to Hirose County. </p>
<p>It ranged from the present Yamatotakada City to Katsuragi City, Koryo-cho, Kita-Katsuragi County. </p>
<p>During the Heian period, the manor was a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Zoyakumen.html">zoyakumen</a> (land that was excepted from all levies except the regular land tax), and the estate of a Sekkan-ke (family which produced regents and advisers). During the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period, it was the estate of the Konoe family. Kasuga-taisha Shrine was the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ryoke.html">ryoke</a> (lord of the manor), and Kofuku-ji Temple Ichijo-in was in charge of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Chigyo.html">chigyo</a> (fief). During the Muromachi period, the manor was reportedly over twenty-one square kilometers (Daijoin <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Jisha (Buddhist Temples and Shinto Shrines).html">jisha</a> zojiki (Miscellaneous Records of the Daijo Temple and Shrine)). It became the heartland of the Hirata clique (including the Taima, Fuse, Oka, and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Manzai.html">Manzai</a> clans; while they were in conflict, both the Toma and Fuse clans also called themselves the Takada clan) of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yamato.html">Yamato</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bushi.html">bushi</a> (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yamato Province.html">Yamato Province</a>). The Hirata clan took charge of important ceremonies, such as the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Yabusame (shooting arrows from a galloping horse).html">yabusame</a> (horseback archery) for the Kasuga Wakamiya On-matsuri (Kasuga-Wakamiya Shrine festival in Nara -- an annual festival where prayers are made for a good harvest and protection against evil). </p>
