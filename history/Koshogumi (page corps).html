<h1>Koshogumi (page corps) (小姓組)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Koshogumi (page corps) was an organization in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Edo bakufu.html">Edo bakufu</a> and one of the bankata which took charge in the military affairs. A similar organizations were called Gobankata (including koshogumi, shoinban [the castle guards], <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shinban.html">Shinban</a> [New Guard], Oban [a group of guards in the Edo shogunate], <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kojunin (小十人) (escort guards).html">Kojunin</a> [Escort Guard]), in which koshogumi and shoinban were collectively called ryoban. Incidentally, the kosyogumi was different from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kosho.html">kosho</a> (pageboy) in the general conception and was purely a combat troop. </p>
<p>It was established in November, 1606 and six people were appointed as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Banto.html">Banto</a> (heads of the group), namely Tadamoto MIZUNO, Masafuyu KUSAKABE, Masatake NARUSE, Noritaka OKUBO, Masanari INOUE, and Shigemune ITAKURA. </p>
<p>Their duty was in the wartime to serve as 直掩備 and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Cavalry.html">cavalry</a> for <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> under the troops of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Hatamoto (direct retainers of shogun).html">hatamoto</a> (direct retainers of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>), and in the peacetime to guard of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> in the castle. Together with shoinban, it was a kind of bodyguard in nature, so qualifications to become a Banshi (a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> serving as a guard in the Edo period) were limited based on the Kakaku (family status) and post of his father. Therefore, the status of Banshi was regarded as higher than the other bankata, thus the Banshi was likely to get higher post. It was under the management of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Wakadoshiyori.html">wakadoshiyori</a> (junior councilor) and the yakudaka (salary paid in accordance with the rank of one's post) of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Banto.html">Banto</a> was 4,000 koku (approximately 0.72 million liters of crop yields). There were six groups in total, each consisted of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Banto.html">Banto</a>, one Kumigashira (the leader) and fifty Banshi. There were additional four groups in nishi no maru (a castle compound to the west of the main compound). </p>
