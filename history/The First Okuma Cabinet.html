<h1>The First Okuma Cabinet (第1次大隈内閣)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Among the Constitutional Party in power, the cabinet was organized with OKUMA from the former Progressive Party (Japan) as the Prime Minister and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Taisuke ITAGAKI.html">Taisuke ITAGAKI</a> from the former Liberal Party (Japan) as Minister of Home Affairs. Therefore, the cabinet is also called the Waihan Cabinet derived from Okuma and Itagaki's names. </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>The third Ito Cabinet resigned en masse to prepare for party organization for Hirobumi ITO. As a result of compromise of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Genro (an elder statesman).html">Genro</a> (elder statesman) to force of the Diet, OKUMA, who was the head seat of the Constitutional Party, the leading party in the House of Representatives at that time, and ITAGAKI formed the cabinet, receiving an Imperial mandate. Although the cabinet lacked the condition in the sense that the head seat did not have position in the diet (the House of Representatives), it was Japan's first party cabinet in terms of the fact that the cabinet members were not from the military but from political parties. </p>
<p>However, inside the Constitutional Party, which was congeries of parties, conflict between the former Progressive Party (Japan) side and the former Liberal Party (Japan) side was serious. The Liberal Party side requested <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Toru HOSHI.html">Toru HOSHI</a> to be appointed as the Foreign Minister, but OKUMA refused it and doubled as Foreign Minister. 
<br/>In addition, dismissal of Yukio OZAKI, the Minister of Education, triggered by the Kyowa enzetsu affair brought an entanglement of replacement that escalated into division of the Constitutional Party by HOSHI<br/>
The cabinet was forced to resign en masse four month after the cabinetmaking. <h3>Incumbency</h3>
