<p></p>
<p>Yoshida dormitory of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/school/Kyoto University.html">Kyoto University</a> is one of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/school/Kyoto University.html">Kyoto University</a>'s dormitories. There are three two-storied wooden buildings (construction) (three buildings). It is one of the four major autonomous student dormitories in Japan. </p>
<p><h3>Facilities</h3>
</p>
<p>Yoshida dormitory is adjacent to Yoshida-minami campus of Kyoto University Yoshida campus. </p>
<p>The dormitory consists of three buildings, the north building, the center building and the south building, and they are placed in an E-shape. Each one is a two-storied building with about forty rooms (26 Japanese-style rooms of 8 - 10 mats [about 14 -18 square meters]) and 95 Japanese-style rooms of 6 - 7.5 mats [about 11 - 13 square meters]). There are other facilities such as an administration building, a pre-fabricated building which is being used for living space, laundry, a shower room and a former dining room etc. </p>
<p>Monthly boarding fee is 400 yen based on 'Regulation on the payments of the students of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/school/Kyoto University.html">Kyoto University</a> (Instruction No. 63 issued in 2006).'<br/>
In addition to a boarding fee, students pay utility expenses and a membership fee for dormitory council. <h3>History</h3>
</p>
<p>The dormitory was constructed in 1913. </p>
<p>It was constructed using scrap wood of the dormitory of the former <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/school/Third High School (under the prewar school educational system).html">Third High School</a>. It consists of three two-storied wooden buildings, which are called the north building, the center building and the south building respectively, and other related facilities. At present, it is the oldest existing university dormitory since Komaba dormitory of Tokyo University was already abolished. </p>
<p>There was a student dormitory at the time when <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/school/Kyoto University.html">Kyoto University</a> was established in 1897. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/school/Kyoto University.html">Kyoto University</a> took over in 1898 the dormitory of the former <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/school/Third High School (under the prewar school educational system).html">Third High School</a>, which was constructed in 1889, and newly constructed the existing Yoshida dormitory in 1913 using its scrap wood. </p>
<p>Although the center building was burned down in 1941, it was reconstructed soon after. </p>
<p>In 1959 and 1960, a dormitory for private workers was converted to a dormitory of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/school/Kyoto University.html">Kyoto University</a>, and the then- existing building and newly converted building were called Yoshida East dormitory and Yoshida West dormitory respectively. </p>
<p>Yoshida West dormitory, which was located inside the pharmaceutical department's campus, was abolished in keeping with the national tendency to abolish national universities' dormitories. On the other hand, Yoshida East dormitory has continued to exist until the present thanks to the opposition movement conducted by the students of the time (to be mentioned later), and about 180 persons, including the students of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/school/Kyoto University.html">Kyoto University</a> as well as their families, are living in the dormitory (the predetermined number of personnel determined by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/school/Kyoto University.html">Kyoto University</a> is 147). Yoshida East dormitory was renamed 'Yoshida dormitory' and has continued to exist up to the present. </p>
<p>On October 31, 1996, the west side of the former dining room was burnt down due to an accidental fire occurring in the building situated on the opposite of the student meeting place (building for club activities). The former dining room was once closed because it became too old, but currently it is now used as a place for various events of the Yoshida dormitory as well as concerts or theatrical performances. </p>
<p>A small fire started at dawn on January 16, 2007 on the first floor of the adjacent student meeting building and two square meters of shed situated under the staircase burned due to this fire. People of club activities as well as the students of Yoshida dormitory engaged in the initial firefighting activities and the fire was put out within 20 minutes after the arrival of fire engines. There were no causalities. </p>
<p>On April 25, 2009, the president of Kyoto University Hiroshi MATSUMOTO announced in the Sankei Shimbun saying 'the university started a consultation with the dormitory council concerning the reconstruction of Yoshida dormitory.'<br/>
<h3>The opposition movement against the closure of dormitory</h3>
</p>
<p>In the 1970's when student movements declined around the nation, student movements at <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/school/Kyoto University.html">Kyoto University</a> were still active using dormitories (autonomous dormitories), some college councils and the west auditorium of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/school/Kyoto University.html">Kyoto University</a> as the base of their activity, and such situations were dubbed 'Japanese Galapagos.'<br/>
</p>
<p>In the late 70's, the authority of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/school/Kyoto University.html">Kyoto University</a> stated to destroy such bases of movements. After forcing through '<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Takemoto.html">Takemoto</a> shobun' (dismissal of associate professor <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Takemoto.html">Takemoto</a>) in 1977, the president Toshio SAWADA implemented the policy of 'normalization of student dormitories' with the aim of abolishing student dormitories including Yoshida dormitory. </p>
<p>In December 1982, the university council decided, without consultation with the members of the dormitory or hearing their opinions, that 'the time limit for staying at Yoshida dormitory is March 31, 1986' (so in original). With the rise in the opposition movement against the above decision conducted by the council of Yoshida dormitory and the graduates, however, the number of dormitory residents increased, instead of decreased, thanks to the success of autonomous selection of residents. 
<br/>As a result, many students still lived in the dormitory at the time of the above 'time limit.'<br/>
In the meantime, some councils, such as the council of the department of liberal arts, conceded the decision of the university, and confrontation among councils arising from differences in philosophy or policy for movements also became apparent. </p>
<p>In 1989 when Yasunori NISHIJIMA was the president, the authority of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/school/Kyoto University.html">Kyoto University</a> (dean of students Hayao KAWAI) and the council of Yoshida dormitory agreed to demolish the west building in exchange for the abolition of the 'time limit.'<br/>
As a result, Yoshida dormitory has since continued to exist as the student dormitory of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/school/Kyoto University.html">Kyoto University</a>. <h3>Construction of a new dormitory</h3>
</p>
<p>After the Great Hanshin-Awaji Earthquake occurred in 1995, questions have been raised from the people both inside and outside of the university about the durability and quake resistance of the dormitory. A budget for seismic-resistance evaluation was approved in 2005 and the evaluations were conducted by outside experts intermittently. </p>
<p>An important movement concerning the continued existence of the dormitory occurred in 2006. </p>
<p>Based on the results of seismic-resistance evaluation conducted in the previous year, executives of Yoshida dormitory requested in February to include the renovation cost of dormitory's dining room in the presidential discretionary budget of the academic year 2006. In June, however, it was revealed that this request was turned down and executives pursued other ways to secure a budget. </p>
<p>In August, the student center of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/school/Kyoto University.html">Kyoto University</a> made a proposal to the executives of Yoshida dormitory saying 'as we will be able to secure the budget for the improvement of students' facilities, why don't you request the budget for reconstructing Yoshida dormitory?'<br/>
Although the above proposal was once declined by Yoshida dormitory, the student center pressed forward with this case behind closed doors. </p>
<p>From the end of September to early October, officers of the student center visited Yoshida dormitory twice. In these meeting, they informed that the student center was prepared to submit the budget for reconstruction, and requested Yoshida dormitory to reply by October 23 whether or not it would accept the reconstruction. Yoshida dormitory's residents discussed day and night about the pros and cons of the proposal as well as the conditions of the negotiation. </p>
<p>A mass bargaining session on the problem of reconstruction was held on October 23. University vice-president Hirohisa HIGASHIYAMA, a responsible person, and several other officers attended as representatives of the university and 80 persons, including the residents of the dormitory, students, and other users, attended as people of the Yoshida dormitory side. In spite of two and a half hours of negotiation, no agreements were reached and the submission of the budget for reconstruction of Yoshida dormitory in the academic year 2006 was not reached. </p>
<p>In the wake of the inauguration of Hiroshi MATSUMOTO as the president of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/school/Kyoto University.html">Kyoto University</a>, Shuzo NISHIMURA was appointed on October 1, 2008 to the vice-president in charge of education, student affairs and international affairs (education). In a meeting in which the council of the dormitory and the university authority participated, Nishimura proposed to reconstruct Yoshida dormitory as soon as possible while the council of the dormitory requested him to keep previous promises. </p>
<p>On April 20, 2009, the authority of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/school/Kyoto University.html">Kyoto University</a> submitted to the council of the dormitory 'the basic policy for the redevelopment of the southernmost area in Yoshida (draft).'<br/>
The authority of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/school/Kyoto University.html">Kyoto University</a> convened on April 24 a meeting to explain the basic policy for reconstruction and about 60 persons of the Yoshida dormitory side participated in this meeting. <h3>Selection for entering the dormitory and easing of the requirements for entering</h3>
</p>
<p>Selection for entering the dormitory is conducted by the council of Yoshida dormitory. The period of selection is set twice a year in spring and in autumn and a 'dormitory-entering selection committee,' an organization of the council of the dormitory, is in charge of selection. </p>
<p>Yoshida dormitory has eased the requirements for entering as a part of the above-mentioned opposition movement against the closure of dormitory. </p>
<p>Although it used to permit only male undergraduates to enter the dormitory, it started to accept female students from 1985. </p>
<p>It started to accept foreign students from the academic year 1990, and from the academic year 1991, it started to allow all students of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/school/Kyoto University.html">Kyoto University</a>, including graduate students, postgraduates, auditing students, junior college students of medical technology (health sciences course in the Medical department), to apply for entering the dormitory. </p>
<p>Further, 'persons who keenly need to live with the students of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/school/Kyoto University.html">Kyoto University</a>' (the handicapped and their support persons, parent and children, a couple etc.) were allowed to apply for entering the dormitory in the academic year 1994. </p>
<p>As the number of applicants increased after the requirements for entering were eased, the current number of residents far exceeds 147, the quota decided by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/school/Kyoto University.html">Kyoto University</a>. As a result, rooms originally used as individual rooms are being shared by two persons now. </p>
<p>Incidentally, a description stating 'only undergraduates are allowed to enter the dormitory' is seen in the regulation for the student dormitory of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/school/Kyoto University.html">Kyoto University</a> (article 3 of the regulation for the student dormitory). According to the guidelines for the students taking an entrance exam and official web-site of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/school/Kyoto University.html">Kyoto University</a>, however, 'students of the university' are qualified to enter dormitories. The above means that the authority of the university officially confirmed the easing of the requirements for entering the dormitory. As a matter of fact, if Yoshida dormitory and Kumano dormitory hadn't eased the requirements on an autonomous basis, there might have been no facilities to accept female students (dormitory for females) and graduate students (Muromachi dormitory). Also, foreign students who were in distress might have faced difficulty in finding affordable lodging. <h3>Famous persons who once lived in the dormitory</h3>
