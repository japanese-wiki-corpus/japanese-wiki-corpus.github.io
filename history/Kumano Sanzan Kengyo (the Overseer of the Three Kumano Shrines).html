<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>In 1090, Emperor <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Shirakawa (the surroundings of the old capital, Kyoto).html">Shirakawa</a> had visited Kumano and observed the place bustling with pilgrimages to Kumano Sanzan; he felt that Kumano Sanzan which had been rather an insignificant local reizan (sacred mountain) needed to be managed systematically. Thus, he appointed Zoyo who acted as a sendatsu (a guide) and was Chori (chief priest) of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Onjo-ji Temple.html">Onjo-ji Temple</a> to the new post, Kumano Sanzan <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kengyo.html">Kengyo</a>, and put it above the Kumano betto, the post for the local land ruler. At the same time, Kumano Sanzan became a part of the central Sogo (Office of Monastic Affairs) system since Chokai, Kumano betto, was appointed to hokkyo (the rank of a priest). </p>
<p>However, Kumano betto and supporting staffs were the ones who ran the governing affairs such as the expected temple affairs as well as the territory management, the security keeping, and the management of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> priests, the priests, and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Yamabushi.html">yamabushi</a> (mountain priests). On the other hand, the main role of Kumano Sanzan <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kengyo.html">Kengyo</a> was acting as a guide when <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Daijo Tenno.html">Daijo Tenno</a> (the retired Emperor) paid visit to Kumano Sanzan. Therefore, characteristically the position emphasized honor and authority rather than the real power; however, as Kumano betto family's power had declined, Kumano Sanzan <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kengyo.html">Kengyo</a> came to seize the power in Kumano after the middle of the 14th century. <h3>History</h3>
</p>
<p>Of all Kumano Sanzan <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kengyo.html">Kengyo</a>, from Zoyo, the founder, to Kakujitsu, the 6th generation, were known to be ascetic Buddhist monks who practiced asceticism in Mt. Omine, Mt. Katsuragi, and Kumano and were appointed to Mitsui Chori, Chori of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Onjo-ji Temple.html">Onjo-ji Temple</a>. Cyogen, the 7th-generation Kumano Sanzan <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kengyo.html">Kengyo</a> after these predecessors, was a ascetic Buddhist monk; however, he not only had no association with Enjo-ji Temple, but also was from the Shingon Sect line's <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Ninna-ji Temple.html">Ninna-ji Temple</a>. Perhaps because of these reasons, he was appointed to Kumano Sanzan <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kengyo.html">Kengyo</a> after he had held a post as Nachi-san Mountain <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kengyo.html">Kengyo</a>. Maybe because Cyogen had strong influence on Kumano Sanzan unlike other Sanzan <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kengyo.html">Kengyo</a>, his predecessors, it is written in the entry on July 5, 1216, of FUJIWARA no Yorisuke's journal of the shrine visits that Kumano betto <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Shingu.html">Shingu</a> betto family and Tanabe betto family's Kaijitsu and Yorisuke had a conversation rather being critical of Cyogen. </p>
<p>Also, during Kakusan's, the 4th-generation Kumano Sanzan <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kengyo.html">Kengyo</a>'s, tenure, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Goshirakawa.html">Emperor Goshirakawa</a> called upon the gods of Imakumanosha Shrine (新熊野社aka '今熊野社') in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Hoju-ji Temple (Kyoto City).html">Hoju-ji Temple</a>'s (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>) premise in 1160 and appointed Kakusan to Imakumano Shrine (literally "New Kumano Shrine" located in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>) <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kengyo.html">Kengyo</a> in 1173. After Jikkei, the 5th generation Sanzan <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kengyo.html">Kengyo</a>, was appointed to the 4th generation Imakumano Shrine <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kengyo.html">Kengyo</a>, Imakumano Shrine <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kengyo.html">Kengyo</a> was decided to be the concurrent job of Sanzan <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kengyo.html">Kengyo</a>; Imakumano Shrine became a foothold of Sanzan <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kengyo.html">Kengyo</a> and Kumano powers in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. </p>
<p>The person named Jogo was appointed to betto after the Jokyu War in which Kumano Sanzan fought on the retired Emperor's side against <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>) under the guidance of the betto's family. However, Jogo was also Tsurugaoka Hachiman-gu Shrine's betto and it is assumed that <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> directly governed Kumano. From Ryoson, the 9th-generation Sanzan <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kengyo.html">Kengyo</a>, the post was appointed to an ascetic Buddhist monk in successive generations; however, the authority of the post was stil just the formality. </p>
<p>However, after the Jokyu War, Kumano betto family's power had declined and they lost control over the competing powers in the Kumano region. Therefore, Kumano Sanzan's governing organization began to undergo major changes in the middle of 14th century and Sanzan <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kengyo.html">Kengyo</a> attempted to govern Kumano directly. There was an early attempt to seize the power in Kumano by Sanzan <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kengyo.html">Kengyo</a>; for example, Sanzan <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kengyo.html">Kengyo</a> issued two monjo (written material) under the name of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Dosho.html">Dosho</a>, the 15th generatlion Sanzan <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kengyo.html">Kengyo</a>, to Nachi-san Mountain's monks in managerial positions asking after the territory in the middle of 15th century. Also, from approximately the time of Cloistered Imperial Prince Gakujo, the 16th generation Sanzan <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kengyo.html">Kengyo</a>, or Doi, the 20th generation Sanzan <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kengyo.html">Kengyo</a> onward, Sanzan <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kengyo.html">Kengyo</a> became Jyudaisyoku, the position passed down to the members of Shogoin <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Monzeki (Monseki).html">monzeki</a> (a temple in which resided a member of nobility or imperial family), with the help of the close tie to Ashikaga Shogun Family. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Takauji ASHIKAGA.html">Takauji ASHIKAGA</a> granted Sanzan <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kengyo.html">Kengyo</a>'s wish and gave a practical support by newly creating a post, Kumano Sanzan <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Bugyo.html">Bugyo</a> (magistrate), to manage practical business in a local land. Takauji (ASHIKAGA) restored <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Zenrin-ji Temple.html">Zenrin-ji Temple</a>'s (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>) Kumano Nyakuoji-sha Shrine and newly constructed Jyojyoin Temple's as its bettojiin (a temple attached to a shrine). Takauji not only appointed Jyojyoin Temple's betto Ryokai to Sanzan <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kengyo.html">Kengyo</a> but also supported Jyojyoin Temple financially by donating private estates. Afterward, the successive generations of Ashikaga <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> cordially protected Jyojyoin Temple's territory and interests and after Shogoin Temple decided Sanzan <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kengyo.html">Kengyo</a> to be Jyudaisyoku (the position passed down to the members of Shogoin <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Monzeki (Monseki).html">monzeki</a>), Kumano Sanzan <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Bugyo.html">Bugyo</a> not only became Jyudaisyoku but also gain the position of the highest rank Inge (a family to support services of the temple). </p>
<p>In addition, the changes in the conditions surrounding private mountain estates in Kumano which took place during the time from the Muromachi Period to the Sengoku period (period of warring states) in Japan helped Kumano Sanzan <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kengyo.html">Kengyo</a> and Sanzan <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Bugyo.html">Bugyo</a> which was placed under Kumano Sanzan <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kengyo.html">Kengyo</a> to increase the power over Kumano Sanzan. During this time, a local lord came to rule the area; as a result, the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Nengu (Land Tax).html">nengu</a> (land tax) paid to Kumano were only a part of rice tax for the religious festivals and sometimes that fell behind. The problem had been resolved with the Kumano's initiative; however, many clans needed help of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a> (provincial constable) or a local ruling family as a mediator. Kumano Sanzan <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kengyo.html">Kengyo</a> and Sanzan <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Bugyo.html">Bugyo</a> often relayed a mediator's messages to the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>; as a result, their influence had increased in Kumano. In this way, Kumano Sanzan <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kengyo.html">Kengyo</a> which was only the honor post in the beginning had expanded the authority and real power with the support of Ashikaga Shogun Family's patronage as Kumano betto family's power had declined in the middle of the 14th century. </p>
<p>Afterwards, Shogoin Temple and Nyakuoji-sha Shrine were burnt down by an army fire in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Onin War.html">Onin War</a>; however, Kumano Sanzan <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kengyo.html">Kengyo</a>'s post itself continued to exist as seen in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Ryoji.html">ryoji</a> (orders issued by princes, empresses, etc.) issued in 1545 and 1564. Also, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Nobunaga ODA.html">Nobunaga ODA</a> donated 30 koku (8.34 cubic meters) of the Saiindai Palace in the Yamashiro Province in 1575; likewise, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI.html">Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI</a> donated 75 koku of the Iwakuradai Palace in the Yamashiro Province in 1585 and 8 to 8 syo belonged of the Kissho-in Temple in the Yamashiro Province in 1591. After the Edo period had started, Hase and Kissho-in Temple which were donated by Hideyoshi were kept as Shuinchi (temple's territory authorized by the Edo shorgunate) and kokuinchi (shrine's and temple's territory authorized by the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">Daimyo</a>). Kumano Sanzan <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kengyo.html">Kengyo</a> continued to exist until 1868; however, when Imperial Prince Miyairido Nobuhito, the last <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kengyo.html">Kengyo</a>, returned to secular life, established Kitashirakawanomiya Palace, and came to be known as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Imperial Prince Kitashirakawanomiya Satonari.html">Imperial Prince Kitashirakawanomiya Satonari</a> in 1870, the post was abolished. </p>
