<h1>Shoki <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shoen.html">Shoen</a> (early <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a>) (初期荘園)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Shoki <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> (early <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a>) were <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> (manors) established through an accumulation of wasteland and a collection of reclaimed rice fields from the eighth to the ninth century. They were also called Kondenchi Kei <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shoen.html">Shoen</a> (manors established by the reclaiming of fields). Land taxes applied to the reclaimed fields, indicating that they were still under the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ritsuryo.html">Ritsuryo</a> system (a system of centralized government based on the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ritsuryo.html">ritsuryo</a> code). </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>After the Konden Einen Shizai Law (a law allowing farmers to permanently own reclaimed fields) was enacted, temples and shrines, as well as nobles in the capital began reclaiming fields on a large scale with active support from the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kokuga (provincial government office compounds).html">Kokuga</a> (provincial government offices) under the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ritsuryo.html">ritsuryo</a> code. At important points in the reclaimed fields, houses called "sho" or "shosho" were constructed for the development and management of the land. The combination of the sho and the reclaimed field came to be called "Shoden" (field within a manor) or "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a>." </p>
<p>There were many Jikonchi Kei <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shoen.html">Shoen</a> in rural areas, in which vast wastelands were defined in order to develop the land with the aid of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kokuga (provincial government office compounds).html">Kokuga</a> under the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ritsuryo.html">ritsuryo</a> code, while, in the Kinai region (provinces surrounding <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and Nara), there were many Kikonchi Ke <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shoen.html">Shoen</a>, which were collected through purchase, exchange, transfer, and donation of well-cultivated rice fields called Konata. In general, nobody lived in the Shoki <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shoen.html">Shoen</a>, so farmers from neighboring handen (allotted farmlands) worked the fields by renting them under the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ritsuryo.html">Ritsuryo</a> system. The governance and management of Shoki <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shoen.html">Shoen</a> was strongly dependent on the national authority. In the ninth century when the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ritsuryo.html">Ritsuryo</a> system began to dissolve, the Jikonchi Kei <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shoen.html">Shoen</a> were no longer able sustain a work force and quickly disappeared. </p>
<p>Nobles, powerful temples and shrines attempted to stabilize the management of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> by appointing a resident of an emerging wealthy class as a sho cho (administrator of a manor) and maintaining a labor force by accepting impoverished people who had run off due debts or escaped from their distributed assignments. The expansion of Kikonchi Kei <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shoen.html">Shoen</a> due to donations from wealthy farmers created serious commotion on the financial base of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ritsuryo.html">Ritsuryo</a> system. In 902, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Tokihira.html">FUJIWARA no Tokihira</a> put into effect the Manor Regulation Acts without success, resulting in a dysfunctional handen-sei (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ritsuryo.html">Ritsuryo</a> land-allotment system). </p>
<p>The <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> at the time, however, depended on the contribution of labor from vagrants and handen farmers for the reclaimed fields, and it is neither slave-labor system, nor the system under which the field and residents were controlled in an integrated manner. Furthermore, from the eleventh to twelfth century, cessation of state power, such as fuyu (tax exemptions) and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Zoyakumen.html">zoyakumen</a> (exception from all levies except regular land taxes) for contributors was not conducted on donated <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> (manors based on donation). As donated <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a>, which were oriented towards total control of the fields and residents, were established nationwide in the late Heian period, Shoki <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shoen.html">Shoen</a> were incorporated into the system and eventually disappeared. </p>
