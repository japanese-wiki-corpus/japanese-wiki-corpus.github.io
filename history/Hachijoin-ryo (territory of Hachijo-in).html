<h1>Hachijoin-ryo (territory of Hachijo-in) (八条院領)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The Hachijoin-ryo was one of the groups of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> (manor in medieval Japan) possessed by members of the imperial family under <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> koryo sei (The System of Public Lands and Private Estates) in the medieval period. The Hachijoin-ryo originated in the territory of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Imperial Princess Akiko.html">Imperial Princess Akiko</a>, who had inherited mainly the territory of the Anrakuju-in Temple, a temple built after a Buddhist temple in Higashi-dono Palace (East Palace) of Toba-dono Palace, an imperial palace for retired and cloistered emperors, as well as the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Toba.html">Emperor Toba</a>'s territory and the Bifukumonin's territory. The territory was passed on from Hachijoin, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Imperial Princess Shoshi.html">Imperial Princess Shoshi</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Juntoku.html">Emperor Juntoku</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Imperial Prince Morisada.html">Imperial Prince Morisada</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Imperial Princess Kuniko.html">Imperial Princess Kuniko</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Kameyama.html">Emperor Kameyama</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Gouda.html">Emperor Gouda</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Imperial Princess Kishi.html">Imperial Princess Kishi</a>, to Emperor Godaigo; it had become a major economic resource for the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Daikakuji-to.html">Daikakuji-to</a> (imperial lineage of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Kameyama.html">Emperor Kameyama</a>). </p>
<p><h3>Hachijoin-ryo and the Jisho-Juei War</h3>
</p>
<p>When <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Prince Mochihito.html">Prince Mochihito</a>, an adopted child of Hachijoin, raised an army against the Taira clan in 1180, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Prince Mochihito.html">Prince Mochihito</a>'s <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ryoji.html">ryoji</a> (orders issued by princes, empresses, etc.) was delivered across the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> of the Hachijoin-ryo. Also involved were: the family of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Yorimasa.html">MINAMOTO no Yorimasa</a> who had served Hachijoin since the time of Bifukumonin; Hachijoin's <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kurodo (Chamberlain).html">Kurodo</a> (Chamberlain) of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Yukiie.html">MINAMOTO no Yukiie</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Nakaie.html">MINAMOTO no Nakaie</a>; the local lord of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> in the Hachijoin-ryo, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Yoshikiyo (Yada no Hangandai).html">MINAMOTO no Yoshikiyo</a> (Yada no Hangandai (assistant officer who served an administration organization called Innocho)); and a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> called Yukihira SHIMOKOBE. <h3>Hachijoin-ryo and the Genko Incident</h3>
</p>
<p>In the Genko Incident in 1331, Emperor Godaigo's edict was delivered across the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> of the Hachijoin-ryo, and this is believed to have been one of the reasons <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Takauji ASHIKAGA.html">Takauji ASHIKAGA</a> in the Ashikaga-no-sho district in the territory of Hachijoin (the Anrakuju-in Temple) raised an army. </p>
