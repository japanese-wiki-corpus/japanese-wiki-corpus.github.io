<h1>Hachijoin-ryo (territory of Hachijo-in) (八条院領)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The Hachijoin-ryo was one of the groups of shoen (manor in medieval Japan) possessed by members of the imperial family under shoen koryo sei (The System of Public Lands and Private Estates) in the medieval period. The Hachijoin-ryo originated in the territory of Imperial Princess Akiko, who had inherited mainly the territory of the Anrakuju-in Temple, a temple built after a Buddhist temple in Higashi-dono Palace (East Palace) of Toba-dono Palace, an imperial palace for retired and cloistered emperors, as well as the Emperor Toba's territory and the Bifukumonin's territory. The territory was passed on from Hachijoin, Imperial Princess Shoshi, Emperor Juntoku, Imperial Prince Morisada, Imperial Princess Kuniko, Emperor Kameyama, Emperor Gouda, Imperial Princess Kishi, to Emperor Godaigo; it had become a major economic resource for the Daikakuji-to (imperial lineage of Emperor Kameyama). </p>
<p><h3>Hachijoin-ryo and the Jisho-Juei War</h3>
</p>
<p>When Prince Mochihito, an adopted child of Hachijoin, raised an army against the Taira clan in 1180, Prince Mochihito's ryoji (orders issued by princes, empresses, etc.) was delivered across the shoen of the Hachijoin-ryo. Also involved were: the family of MINAMOTO no Yorimasa who had served Hachijoin since the time of Bifukumonin; Hachijoin's Kurodo (Chamberlain) of MINAMOTO no Yukiie and MINAMOTO no Nakaie; the local lord of the shoen in the Hachijoin-ryo, MINAMOTO no Yoshikiyo (Yada no Hangandai (assistant officer who served an administration organization called Innocho)); and a samurai called Yukihira SHIMOKOBE. <h3>Hachijoin-ryo and the Genko Incident</h3>
</p>
<p>In the Genko Incident in 1331, Emperor Godaigo's edict was delivered across the shoen of the Hachijoin-ryo, and this is believed to have been one of the reasons Takauji ASHIKAGA in the Ashikaga-no-sho district in the territory of Hachijoin (the Anrakuju-in Temple) raised an army. </p>
