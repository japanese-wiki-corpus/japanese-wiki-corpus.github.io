<h1>Dosoyaku (tax for doso) (土倉役)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Dosoyaku, also known as kurayaku, was a tax on doso (pawnbrokers and moneylenders) in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> during the medieval era. It was the main source of revenue, especially for the Muromachi <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>). </p>
<p><h3><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a></h3>
</p>
<p>It has been estimated that the collection of dosoyaku began during the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period. Due to the fact that doso in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> were under the control of Gion-sha Shrine, which was affiliated with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Enryaku-ji Temple.html">Enryaku-ji Temple</a>, they were often taxed by both and also subject to extraordinary taxation by the Imperial court. The taxation was so frequent that there was an article protecting doso in the Kenmu code. <h3>Muromachi <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a></h3>
</p>
<p>As the Muromachi <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> was establishing authority in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, deputy collecting officials of the Imperial court took on the task of imposing independent taxes on doso for the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> that had a weak financial base. In 1393 the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> issued 'Five rules regarding doso and sake shops scattered around Rakuchu' which was a five-article law. The law denied the interests of influential families, including <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Enryaku-ji Temple.html">Enryaku-ji Temple</a>, minimizing the taxation by the Imperial court and other parties. It is believed that dosoyaku was charged in accordance with the number of items held by a doso. Sake shops and doso paid the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> 6,000 kan (now obsolete unit of currency) per year in return for being exempted from other taxes. The <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> directly collected dosoyaku at first, but later on appointed influential doso as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Nosenkata (an institution to collect taxes from moneylenders and sake breweries).html">nosenkata</a> (an institution to collect tax from moneylenders and sake breweries) and had them collect dosoyaku from several dozens of doso. This process eventually turned into a kind of subcontract system. Furthermore, the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> also appointed a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kubo-okura (financial branch).html">Kubo-okura</a> (financial branch) and entrusted the revenue, including dosoyaku and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Sakaya.html">Sakaya</a> yaku (taxes imposed on sake breweries by Muromachi <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>), with selected <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Nosenkata (an institution to collect taxes from moneylenders and sake breweries).html">nosenkata</a>. A conflict over dosoyaku with the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Enryaku-ji Temple.html">Enryaku-ji Temple</a> continued for nearly a hundred years, and the state that <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Enryaku-ji Temple.html">Enryaku-ji Temple</a> collected dosoyaku at their discretion and the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> issued the ban was occurred repeatedly even in Bunmei Era (1469-1487). When <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Tokuseirei.html">Tokuseirei</a> (ordering return of land sold and dissolution of debts) was issued due to a peasant uprising, the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> had to suspend the collection of dosoyaku, making it an unstable form of revenue even though it was an indispensable form of income. The amount of revenue is not clear, but based on records of the time, it is estimated that 200 <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/kanmon.html">kanmon</a> was paid to the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> every month during the Kakitsu Era (1141-1144). </p>
