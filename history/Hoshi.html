<h1>Hoshi (保司)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Hoshi refers to officers of provincial government who administered ho, which was a type of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kokugaryo.html">Kokugaryo</a> (the territories governed by a provincial government office) in medieval Japan. </p>
<p>Ho (shogunal demesne) and Sho (private land)<br/>
Although a theory has it that ho was a small-scale <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> (manor), ho was originally a shogunal demesne which was distinguished from sho, which were private lands. </p>
<p>On September 14, 1186, according to Azumakagami (The chronology of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> [Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>]), <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Yoritomo.html">MINAMOTO no Yoritomo</a> appointed <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/TAIRA no Yasuyori.html">TAIRA no Yasuyori</a> as hoshi of Oe no ho, a shogunal demesne in the Province of Awa. </p>
<p>Therefore <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Nengu (Land Tax).html">nengu</a> (land tax) collected from Oe no ho was customarily deposited with the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kuraryo.html">Kuraryo</a> (Bureau of Palace Storehouses) of the Imperial Court.
