<h1>Hoshi (保司)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Hoshi refers to officers of provincial government who administered ho, which was a type of Kokugaryo (the territories governed by a provincial government office) in medieval Japan. </p>
<p>Ho (shogunal demesne) and Sho (private land)<br/>
Although a theory has it that ho was a small-scale shoen (manor), ho was originally a shogunal demesne which was distinguished from sho, which were private lands. </p>
<p>On September 14, 1186, according to Azumakagami (The chronology of the Kamakura bakufu [Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun]), MINAMOTO no Yoritomo appointed TAIRA no Yasuyori as hoshi of Oe no ho, a shogunal demesne in the Province of Awa. </p>
<p>Therefore nengu (land tax) collected from Oe no ho was customarily deposited with the Kuraryo (Bureau of Palace Storehouses) of the Imperial Court.
