<h1>Jako no ma shiko (麝香間祗候)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Jako no ma shiko was one of the licenses of the Imperial Court defined by the Constitution of the Empire of Japan, in order to treat the peerages and government officials for their contributions, and the person who rendered a distinguished service for the Meiji Restoration. This license was reflected on the class standing and the treatment within the Imperial Court. </p>
<p>This license followed shiko shu license system of the Imperial Court during Edo period. </p>
<p>This license was established in 1869 when the Imperial Court summoned the former gijo (official post) Mochiaki HACHISUKA and some other members of the government to appear in Jako no ma of Kyoto Imperial Palace every other day as the advisers of the emperor. This licensee was treated as an official appointed by the emperor, while it was an honorary position without any salary. The licensees were held at service in Jako no ma of the Imperial Court.
