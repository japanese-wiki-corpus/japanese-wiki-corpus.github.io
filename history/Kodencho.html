<h1>Kodencho (校田帳)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>A kodencho was an account book made to report to the central government on the results of koden (research of public paddy fields in a ryoseikoku [province]) by a kodenshi (koden researcher) or a kokushi (provincial governor) sent by the central government under the ritsuryo system in ancient Japan. The kodencho put together with a jukocho, a record of qualified handen (allotted farmland) owners, was also called koden-jukocho. </p>
<p>Based on the results of kodencho and jukocho, actual handen (allotting farmland to farmers) was performed, however, the descriptions in kodencho gradually became untrue as Handen Shuju ho (law of rice field allotment system) was emasculated. Therefore, large scale checkups were performed in 862. </p>
