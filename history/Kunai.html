<h1>Kunai (くない)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kunai is a small tool used by ninja. Kunai has a shape which can be easily hidden. Kunai is written as '苦内' or '苦無' in Chinese characters. </p>
<p>Kunai was originally a tool which was treated as an utility knife or an all-purpose scoop in the general market at the time and thus ninja began to use it as a weapon because no one was suspicious of a person who carried a kunai with him. </p>
<p>Two variations are dai-kunai (big kunai) (ranging about from 13 to 15 cm in length) and sho-kunai (small kunai) (ranging about from 8 to 10 cm in length). </p>
<p>Kunai has flat claws made of iron and it was used to climb walls or dig holes in walls or ground. </p>
<p>Kunai is well known as well as shuriken (ninja throwing stars, multi-pointed throwing weapon) and makibishi (small, spiked caltrops used by ninja) as tools used by ninja, but kunai was little used except the case where it was needed immediately as a substitution because it was made of a high quality wrought iron. </p>
<p>Small kunai may be used like shuriken and it is called 'tobi-kunai'. </p>
<p>Kunai is made by forging wakugi (Japanese nail) by hand and forming into the shape of kunai. Kunai is not a standard article and therefore it comes in various sizes and shapes, and its center of gravity is unstable because it was originally made as a tool, not as a throwing weapon, as described above. Therefore it was said that only a very skilled person could hit a target because stabbing the target with a kunai was more difficult than with a shuriken. </p>
