<h1>Kunai (くない)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kunai is a small tool used by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Ninja (professional spy in feudal Japan highly trained in stealth and secrecy).html">ninja</a>. Kunai has a shape which can be easily hidden. Kunai is written as '苦内' or '苦無' in Chinese characters. </p>
<p>Kunai was originally a tool which was treated as an utility knife or an all-purpose scoop in the general market at the time and thus <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Ninja (professional spy in feudal Japan highly trained in stealth and secrecy).html">ninja</a> began to use it as a weapon because no one was suspicious of a person who carried a kunai with him. </p>
<p>Two variations are dai-kunai (big kunai) (ranging about from 13 to 15 cm in length) and sho-kunai (small kunai) (ranging about from 8 to 10 cm in length). </p>
<p>Kunai has flat claws made of iron and it was used to climb walls or dig holes in walls or ground. </p>
<p>Kunai is well known as well as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Shuriken (Small Throwing Blade).html">shuriken</a> (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Ninja (professional spy in feudal Japan highly trained in stealth and secrecy).html">ninja</a> throwing stars, multi-pointed throwing weapon) and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Makibishi.html">makibishi</a> (small, spiked caltrops used by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Ninja (professional spy in feudal Japan highly trained in stealth and secrecy).html">ninja</a>) as tools used by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Ninja (professional spy in feudal Japan highly trained in stealth and secrecy).html">ninja</a>, but kunai was little used except the case where it was needed immediately as a substitution because it was made of a high quality wrought iron. </p>
<p>Small kunai may be used like <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Shuriken (Small Throwing Blade).html">shuriken</a> and it is called 'tobi-kunai'. </p>
<p>Kunai is made by forging wakugi (Japanese nail) by hand and forming into the shape of kunai. Kunai is not a standard article and therefore it comes in various sizes and shapes, and its center of gravity is unstable because it was originally made as a tool, not as a throwing weapon, as described above. Therefore it was said that only a very skilled person could hit a target because stabbing the target with a kunai was more difficult than with a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Shuriken (Small Throwing Blade).html">shuriken</a>. </p>
