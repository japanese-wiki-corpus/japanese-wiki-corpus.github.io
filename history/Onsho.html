<p>Onsho (reward grants) is defined as follows. In the battles fought before the early modern times, the master honored his <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kenin.html">kenin</a> (retainers) or <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> warriors who rendered outstanding military service and granted them territories, written appointments, testimonials, goods, rank and office confirmations, or commendation to governmental posts. (Related term: Onkyu [reward from master to vassal]). </p>
<p><h3>Ancient times</h3>
</p>
<p>The practice of reward grants in Japan goes back to ancient times when the Imperial Court appointed those who rendered distinguished service in conquering Ezo or fighting rebellions as government officials or promoted them. In the ninth century when the private warrior bands (in ancient Japan) became nominal and effectively disappeared, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Gunji.html">gunji</a> (district officials), the rich and powerful class, and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Fushu (barbarians).html">fushu</a> (the indigenous tribes of the north-eastern Japan who became allies of the Imperial Court) were formed as military forces under 'hatsuhei-chokufu' (an imperial order authorizing the mobilization of soldiers). <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/The Imperial Court.html">The Imperial Court</a> granted rewards to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Gunji.html">gunji</a>, the rich and powerful class, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Fushu (barbarians).html">fushu</a> who were of great service. Around the end of the ninth century <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kokushi.html">kokushi</a> (provincial officials) (in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kokuga (provincial government office compounds).html">kokuga</a> [provincial office structure]) who received 'tsuibu kanpu' (Warrants of Pursuit and Capture) from the Imperial Court were able to form, at their discretion, troops with <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Gunji.html">gunji</a> and the rich and powerful class. Those among them who carried out fine performance were rewarded by the Imperial Court. In the early 10th century, Kanbyo Engi Togoku War took place in the east, and Joheinankaizoku (rebellion by pirates in Seto inland sea) in the west. In suppressing these insurgencies, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kokushi.html">kokushi</a>, military, the rich and powerful class (Tato <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Fumyo.html">fumyo</a> [powerful cultivator who managed farm operations and collected tax] class) provided outstanding service which, however, was not sufficiently rewarded. Their discontent, which increased over time, in part led to the Johei and Tengyo War. In the course of these events, a military system centering on <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kokushi.html">kokushi</a> (the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kokuga (provincial government office compounds).html">kokuga</a> system); namely, the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kokuga (provincial government office compounds).html">kokuga</a> forces system was formed. </p>
<p>In the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kokuga (provincial government office compounds).html">kokuga</a> forces system, the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kokushi.html">kokushi</a> who held supreme command in the military affairs held a decisive position. From the 10th to the 11th century 'the hereditary governmental offices' which were transmitted among certain families in the aristocratic society developed rapidly. It was in this context that warrior houses (tsuwamono no ie) whose 'family business' was martial arts and military affairs emerged. The warrior houses held <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Zuryo (The Head of The Provincial Governors).html">zuryo</a> (custodial governor) governorships and were also appointed <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Oryoshi.html">Oryoshi</a> (Suppression and Control Agents) or <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Tsuibushi (Pursuit and Apprehension Agent).html">Tsuibushi</a> (Pursuit and Apprehension Agents). Taking advantage of military expertise which they had acquired over many generations, they formed military forces in the provinces. Some formed personal master-servant relationships with Tato <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Fumyo.html">fumyo</a>. In the 11th century the tsuwamono no ie evolved into military lords. In the mid-11th century the dynastic nation system transformed itself (to the late dynastic nation). Many Tato <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Fumyo.html">fumyo</a> became local lords as they were militarized. {The <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kokuga (provincial government office compounds).html">kokuga</a> forces system}, on the other hand, collapsed. The Ikkoku-toryo' (the provincial leader) who held the offices of provincial <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Oryoshi.html">Oryoshi</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Tsuibushi (Pursuit and Apprehension Agent).html">Tsuibushi</a> in place of the provincial officials organized military forces. Ikkoku-toryo who were also military nobles confirmed the territories of the Tato <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Fumyo.html">fumyo</a> class and so on to guaranteed their hereditary prerogatives. The Tato <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Fumyo.html">fumyo</a> class were given new holdings according to their meritorious performance in battle. This assessment and provision of rewards based on military performance was called ronko <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kosho.html">kosho</a>. Suppressing revolts and rebellions by leading their private warrior bands (whose constituents were the Tato <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Fumyo.html">fumyo</a> class who were also local lords) under 'tsuibu kanpu,' the military nobles earned rewards. They in turn recommended the Imperial Court to reward kejin, and were involved in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kenin.html">kenin</a>'s <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Appointment (Ninkan).html">appointment</a> as governmental officials or their promotion. They were also granted new territory by appointed to shokan-shiki (estate manager). Among the military nobles, Seiwa Genji (the Minamoto clan) and Kanmu Heishi (the Taira clan), who were endowed with the high Shii (Fourth Rank), stood out as the chieftains of the warrior class, namely Buke no toryo (the leader of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> families), that newly emerged in this period. While Buke no toryo distributed territories to their <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kenin.html">kenin</a>, they actively sought to become <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kokushi.html">kokushi</a>, which would provide them both handsome income, or to obtain a higher rank, which would lead higher grade in the central government, or to access to the Imperial Palace to advance their political status in the Imperial Court. The toryo (leader) of the Minamoto clan and the Taira clan thus achieved their standing in the central politics as well as establishing their military power in the countryside through their military achievements. </p>
<p>Reward grants always raised the question of fairness. Those who reported distinguished services were <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Zuryo (The Head of The Provincial Governors).html">zuryo</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Tsuibushi (Pursuit and Apprehension Agent).html">tsuibushi</a>, and tsuitoshi (envoy to search and kill), and so on, who did not necessarily give detailed accounts. The reporter might have favored some over others. It can be said therefore that there was constantly latent dissatisfaction at granted rewards. For the warriors, rewards were of utmost significance in keeping up their family honors and permanence, in maintaining their political status and power. <h3>Medieval Times</h3>
</p>
<p>Following the Heiji War, the Taira clan established a new order both in the national political arena and the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> warrior society. Consequently, the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> who were originally mediators of rewards came to acquire the position of reward-giver. The Taira regime took control of many appointments and manors, thereby acquiring the position that enabled them to manage reward grants. They thus strengthened their power and ruled over the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> in the provinces. However, many <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> were more or less discontent with reward grants given by the Taira clan. Their dissatisfaction is regarded as one of the factors that triggered the Jisho-Juei Civil War. </p>
<p>It was <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Yoritomo.html">MINAMOTO no Yoritomo</a> who established the military government after the Taira-clan regime. As the basis of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Yoritomo.html">MINAMOTO no Yoritomo</a>'s political power was the Kanto warrior bands, it was of utmost importance for Yoritomo to gain the Kanto <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a>'s support. He paid careful attention to ensure that Kanto <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> warriors were content with the rewards they received during the period between the Jisho-Juei Civil War and the Battle of Oshu. In the mid to late <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period the concept of rewards became more diverse. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Gokenin.html">Gokenin</a> (shogunal retainers) were given rights to claim rewards for their meritorious performance in battle by submitting service citations. Their claims were examined by onsho <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Bugyo.html">bugyo</a> (the office of rewards). Based on their examination result, they were given land and property rights in the form of the grant of holdings or the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Appointment (Ninkan).html">appointment</a> to the posts of jito (military estate steward), manor manger, and governmental officer. If there had been any conflict in an existing holding, a holding confirmation could have replaced a reward. Rights to commend meritorious warriors to posts in the Imperial Court or to appoint them to posts in the Shogunate were also regarded as rewards. Assuring local <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Gokenin.html">gokenin</a> as the position of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a> (provincial constable) led them become more powerful and extend their influence to the national politics. Kamakura-dono (lord of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a>) and regents began to give the names (in which one character was identical to that of the givers) to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Gokenin.html">gokenin</a>, which cannot be considered pure rewards, although the names given by the shoguns were regarded as the highest honors. The grant of written testimonials praising outstanding military services was instituted in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period and onwards. <h3>Early Modern Times</h3>
</p>
<p>After the War the notions of honor, public recognition, commendation, and performance review have become common and the concept of onsho (rewards) has not been publicly used, however, when ruling-party politicians who rendered service in the formation of the government or cabinet are appointed to important posts or enter the cabinet, this is sometime ridiculed as onsho or reward-oriented appointments. </p>
