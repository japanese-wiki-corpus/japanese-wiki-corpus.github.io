<h1>Gyobu-sho (刑部省)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Gyobu-sho (Ministry of Justice) was a government-regulated organization in Japan under the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ritsuryo.html">Ritsuryo</a> system (a system of centralized government based on the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ritsuryo.html">ritsuryo</a> codes). Gyobu-sho was also one of the central ministries in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period. </p>
<p>Gyobu-sho (in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ritsuryo.html">Ritsuryo</a> system)<br/>
Gyobu-sho was one of the eight central ministries under the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ritsuryo.html">Ritsuryo</a> system. With administering the entire judicial affairs, Gyobu-sho engaged in the trials of serious incidents, the management of prisons and the execution of punishments. However, as for minor offences, each government official had jurisdiction independently. Since the post of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kebiishi (police and judicial chief).html">Kebiishi</a> (officials with judicial and police powers) was provided in the Heian period, the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kebiishi (police and judicial chief).html">Kebiishi</a> deprived most of the businesses entrusted to Gyobu-sho, with the result that Gyobu-sho became the nominal ministry. </p>

The departments of Hanji and Tokibe were regarded as different departments from Gyobu-sho to some degree. </p>
<p>The Gyobu-Kyo, the Secretary of Gyobu-sho, corresponded to Shoshiinoge (Senior Fourth Rank, Lower Grade). <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/TAIRA no Tadamori.html">TAIRA no Tadamori</a> counted among successive Gyobu-Kyo.
