<h1>Heguri Clan (an ancient powerful local clan based in Heguri County, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yamato Province.html">Yamato Province</a>) (平群氏)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The Heguri clan is said to be a descendant of TAKENOUCHI no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Sukune.html">Sukune</a> and one of the ancient powerful local clans based in Heguri no go, Heguri County in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yamato Province.html">Yamato Province</a> (present Heguri Town, Ikoma County, Nara Prefecture). <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kabane (hereditary title).html">Kabane</a> (hereditary title) was Omi and later it was changed to Ason. </p>
<p>According to "Nihon Shoki" (Chronicles of Japan), the Heguri clan was active as a military clan from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Ojin.html">Emperor Ojin</a>'s Court and HEGURI no Tsuku no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Sukune.html">Sukune</a> came to participate in the national politics in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Richu.html">Emperor Richu</a>'s Court. Since <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Yuryaku.html">Emperor Yuryaku</a>'s Court after the fall of the Katsuragi clan, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/HEGURI no Matori.html">HEGURI no Matori</a>, a child of Tsuku successively held the position of 'Oomi' (a highest officer in national politics of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yamato.html">Yamato</a> dynasty) and the clan fully enjoyed their prosperity. However, after <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Ninken.html">Emperor Ninken</a>'s death, Matori Oomi, having wanted to be the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/King of Japan (Nihon Kokuo).html">King of Japan</a>, became tyrannical to govern the nation as he wanted and was feared his power excluding even the Imperial Family, which is considered to be a cause that Kanamura OTOMO by the order of Prince Wakasazaki (later <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Buretsu (Muretsu).html">Emperor Buretsu</a>) killed Matori and his son, HEGURI no Shibi in 498. </p>
<p>After this, members of the Heguri clan disappear from "Nihon Shoki" (The Chronicle of Japan) for a while, but in 587 the name of HEGURI no Kamite appears as the General to subjugate the Mononobe clan; by this time the Heguri clan had gained the position to be elected as daibu (master). In November, 684 the Heguri clan was granted <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kabane (hereditary title).html">kabane</a> (hereditary title) of Ason again when the Imperial Court enforced the yakusa no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kabane (hereditary title).html">kabane</a> system (eight official titles conferred upon nobles by Emperor Tenmu). The Heguri clan produced government officials such as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/HEGURI no Hironari.html">HEGURI no Hironari</a> in the Nara period, but afterwards the clan went to ruin. </p>
<p><h3>Various Theories</h3>
</p>
<p>According to archeologists, when they see the changes of Heguridani-kofun Tumulus Cluster (located in present Heguri Town) which is said to be the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Okutsuki.html">okutsuki</a> (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> tomb) of the Heguri clan, the emergence of the Heguri clan cannot be traced before the middle of the sixth century. Based on the above fact, a theory that regards the Heguri clan to be a new powerful local clan after Kamite of the later sixth century is gaining supporters recently. Accordingly, the description in "Nihon Shoki" in which Matori took the position of Oomi and wielded arbitrary power is not accepted as a historical fact; it is explained that the story was intentionally made up by the Heguri clan themselves driven by a feeling of competition to the Soga clan who is considered to be the descendant of the same TAKENOUCHI no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Sukune.html">Sukune</a> as the Heguri clan. We should note, related with the formation of the legend of the clan, that in 681 HEGURI no Kobito participated in the project of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Teiki (records of Emperors family tree).html">Teiki</a> (the genealogy of the Imperial Family) and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Kyuji (A Record of Stories Current at Court).html">Kyuji</a> (a record of stories current at court) and also included in the various clans asked to submit an 'epitaph' in 691. </p>
