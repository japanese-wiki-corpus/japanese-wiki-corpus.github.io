<h1>Choya Gunsai (朝野群載)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Choya gunsai was edited by MIYOSHI no Tameyasu, San hakase (Doctor of Numbers), who classified monjo (written materials) n the Heian period such as prose and poetry, imperial decrees, official documents from the Dajokan (Great Council of State). It was completed in 1116. However, it was enlarged in later years, so that the final completion is estimated to be from 1135 to 1141. The original book consisted of thirty volumes; however, the volumes 10, 14, 18, 19, 23, 24, 25, 29, and 30 do not exist today. </p>
<p>The classification includes such items as literary art, chogi (ceremony at Imperial Court), Jingikan (Department of Divinities), Daijokan (Grand Council of State), the Setsuroku family (the family which produced the Regent and the Chief Adviser to the Emperor), the Kugyo family (kugyo means a Court noble), besso, achievements, teii (Chinese name of police), naiki (secretary of the Ministry of Central Affairs), kiden (biographical books), Onmyodo (yin-yang philosophy), rekido (the study of the calendar), tenmondo (astrology), ido (medical ethics), Buddhist service, Dazaifu (local government office in Kyushu region), foreign countries, miscellaneous writings, misfortunes, shokoku-zatsuji (miscellaneous matters of various districts), shokoku-kumon (official documents of various districts) and shokoku koka (merits and demerits of various districts), however, these items are about existing parts, therefore, it is unknown what kinds of classification were included in the missing nine volumes. </p>
<p>As easily understood from the above, this book, including many affairs of shoshi (officials), has more characteristics as collected monjo (written material) than as a poetry miscellany. As the editor, MIYOSHI no Tameyasu himself stated that he had collected 'hogo' (scraps of paper), the book, including many historical materials especially in the end of Heian period when he lived, makes itself a valuable collection of monjo that reports realities of government according to the Ritsuryo code from the middle to the end of the Heian period. </p>
<p>In 1938, it was included in the 29th volume of "Enlarged New Edition of the Summa Japanese History" compiled by Katsumi KUROSAKA (Yoshikawa Kobunkan Inc.). </p>
