<h1>Budan Seiji (government by the military) (武断政治)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Budan Seiji is an authoritarian government based on military power. </p>
<p>It usually refers to a government ruled by shogun from Ieyasu TOKUGAWA to Iemitsu TOKUGAWA in the early Edo period. Under the rule of Iemitsu, many domains were abolished and an increase in the number of ronin (masterless samurai) became a social problem. After the incident of Shosetsu YUI and the Joo Incident, the fourth shogun Ietsuna TOKUGAWA undertook conversion into a civilian government. </p>
