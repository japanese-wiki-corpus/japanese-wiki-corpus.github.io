<h1>The Incident of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Honkoku-ji Temple.html">Honkoku-ji Temple</a> (本圀寺の変)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The Incident of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Honkoku-ji Temple.html">Honkoku-ji Temple</a>, on January 31, 1569, was an attack of Miyoshi sanninshu (three chief retainers of the Miyoshi clan) on <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshiaki ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshiaki ASHIKAGA</a>, seii taishogun (literally, "great general who subdues the barbarians") of the Muromachi <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>), who was in his temporary residence (Rokujo Palace) in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Honkoku-ji Temple.html">Honkoku-ji Temple</a> (it was called 'Honkoku-ji' then). It is also called the battle of Rokujo. </p>
<p><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshiaki ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshiaki ASHIKAGA</a>, who assumed the title of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> in September of the previous year after going up to the capital while being backed by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Nobunaga ODA.html">Nobunaga ODA</a>, made <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Honkoku-ji Temple.html">Honkoku-ji Temple</a> as his temprorary residence instead of Gosho (the Imperial Palace) because it had been burnt down in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Eiroku Incident.html">Eiroku Incident</a>. Nobunaga, after assuring the peace in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, returned once to his base Gifu-jo Castle in Mino Province. </p>
<p>However, Miyoshi sanninshu, who were in exile in Settsu Province expelled by Nobunaga from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> earlier, with the aim of gaining power in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> again, attacked <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Honkoku-ji Temple.html">Honkoku-ji Temple</a> while Nobunaga was absent from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, and when the guards of Yoshiaki let their guard down during the New Year. </p>
<p>However against all odds, because Yoshiaki's close aids <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yusai HOSOKAWA.html">Yusai HOSOKAWA</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Mitsuhide AKECHI.html">Mitsuhide AKECHI</a> fought a good fight, and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Katsumasa IKEDA.html">Katsumasa IKEDA</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshitsugu MIYOSHI.html">Yoshitsugu MIYOSHI</a> arrived to rescue them the next day, Miyoshi sanninshu took escaped the pincer movement. </p>
<p>Nobunaga hurriedly returned to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> after five days, and thought that merchants of Sakai were pulling strings behind the scene before imposing yasen (war funds) on Sakai to restrict their autonomy. </p>
