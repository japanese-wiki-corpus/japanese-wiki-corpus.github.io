<h1>kanmon (勘文)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The term Kanmon means written reports (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Kanshin.html">Kanshin</a>) for various information such as origins/precedents that were submitted by scholars, etc. at the request of the Imperial court. Such a survey was principally conducted by Geki (Secretary of the Grand Council of State), <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Jingikan.html">Jingikan</a> (department of worship) and scholars of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shodo (Daigaku-ryo).html">Shodo</a> (various fields of academy) belonged to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Daigaku-ryo.html">Daigaku-ryo</a> (Bureau of Education under the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ritsuryo.html">ritsuryo</a> system) or <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Onmyoryo.html">Onmyoryo</a> (Bureau of Divination). Kanmon written by the scholars of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shodo (Daigaku-ryo).html">Shodo</a> were specifically called Shodo Kanmon. </p>
<p>In the event of a matter of national concern, the Imperial court ordered professional bureaucrats and scholars to submit <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Kanjin.html">Kanjin</a> and used it as reference materials at Jin no sadame (ancient cabinet council) of Daijokan (Grand Council of State) and/or In no hyojo (consultation under the government by the Retired Emperor). Kanmon submitted by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Tenyakuryo.html">Tenyakuryo</a> (the Bureau of Medicine) when the epidemic of smallpox occurred in 737 was recorded as a countermeasure in "Ruiju fusensho" (A collection of official documents dating from the years 737 to 1093). Other than the above, Tenmon Kanmon submitted at the time of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Tenmon misso.html">Tenmon misso</a> (reporting unusual astronomical phenomena to the emperor) and Myobo Kanmon submitted by scholars of law on the occasion of criminal cases are well-known. It was said that 200 volumes of '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shodo (Daigaku-ryo).html">Shodo</a> kanmon' (written reports by various scholars from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Daigaku-ryo.html">Daigaku-ryo</a> and Onmyo-ryo) and 'Zoku <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shodo (Daigaku-ryo).html">shodo</a> kanmon' (its number of volumes is unclear) were inherited by the Nakahara clan, which had the qualification of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Tenmon misso.html">Tenmon misso</a> at Geki. However, only two volumes of '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shodo (Daigaku-ryo).html">Shodo</a> kanmon' that were compiled in "Gunsho ruiju" (Collection of historical documents compiled by Hokiichi HANAWA) are existing today. </p>
