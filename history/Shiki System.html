Shiki System (職の体系)
</h1>

<p></p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shiki (a rank in government offices under ritsuryo system).html">shiki</a> system is the term to indicate the stratified ruling structure in medieval Japan. The system was found mainly in western Japan from the mid Heian period to the taiko <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kenchi.html">kenchi</a> (the cadastral surveys conducted by Hideyoshi). </p>
<p><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shiki (a rank in government offices under ritsuryo system).html">Shiki</a>' originally meant the duty concerning land ruling, but a certain amount of authority on earnings associated with <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shiki (a rank in government offices under ritsuryo system).html">shiki</a> authority was also called '<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shiki (a rank in government offices under ritsuryo system).html">shiki</a>.'<br/>
In this article the word <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shiki (a rank in government offices under ritsuryo system).html">shiki</a> is used here in the sense of latter one. </p>
<p><h3>Coming into existence</h3>
</p>
<p>The collapse of the ancient family registration that had begun in the end 8th century did not stop in the early Heian period and the direct control of people by the central government became impossible in the mid Heian period. Therefore, the land tax collection system by the ancient government moved from the framework based on the rule over people under the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Ritsuryo.html">Ritsuryo</a> system into the one on medieval land ruling. The unit of the medieval land ruling is called <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Myoden.html">myoden</a> (rice field lots in the charge of a nominal holder), and at that period the wealthy class called Tato (cultivators) that came from <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Gunji.html">gunji</a> (local magistrates) and native provincial governors undertook the management of myo and came to be called <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Fumyo.html">Fumyo</a> (tiller of the public rice field). Tato that became deeply involved in the management of Imperial demesne, obtaining the position of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Myoshu.html">myoshu</a> (owner of rice field), not only ran the management of cultivated land but also developed new rice fields by themselves, and became feudal lords or <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kaihatsu-Ryoshu.html">kaihatsu-ryoshu</a> (local notables who developed the land). </p>
<p>And in order to avoid one's domain being confiscated into Koryo (an Imperial demesne), they donated their land as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> (manor in medieval Japan) to Juryoso (career provincial class) and paid a certain amount of tax to Juryoso, maintaining effective dominion on the land as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shokan.html">shokan</a> (an officer governing <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a>), which is called contribution with reserving authority. Juryoso that thus came to hold <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> was called <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Ryoke.html">ryoke</a> (a lord of the manor), and because confiscating <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kokushi.html">kokushi</a> (provincial governors) who belonged to the same hierarchy as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Ryoke.html">ryoke</a> continued, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Ryoke.html">ryoke</a> donated their land to the upper kenmon (an influential family) class. Kenmon class that accumulated <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> were called <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Honke.html">honke</a> (the head family). And among <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Ryoke.html">ryoke</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Honke.html">honke</a>, the ones who had the right of effective dominion were called <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Honjo (proprietor or guarantor of manor).html">honjo</a> (proprietor or guarantor of manor). 
<br/>In the structure of stratified land ruling by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shokan.html">shokan</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Ryoke.html">ryoke</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Honke.html">honke</a>, the right held by each subject is called '<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shiki (a rank in government offices under ritsuryo system).html">shiki</a>.'<br/>
</p>
<p><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shokan.html">Shokan</a> held <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Azukaridokoro.html">azukaridokoro</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shiki (a rank in government offices under ritsuryo system).html">shiki</a> (the right that <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Azukaridokoro.html">azukaridokoro</a> (a deputy of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> manor lord) had), <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Ryoke.html">ryoke</a> held ryokeshiki (the economical right as a lord of the manor) and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Honke.html">honke</a> held <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Honke.html">honke</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shiki (a rank in government offices under ritsuryo system).html">shiki</a> (the right that the head family had). </p>
<p>In the meantime, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kokushi.html">kokushi</a> who strengthened their rights by the contracting system of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kokushi.html">kokushi</a> began to deal with Koryo as if it were their own property and appointed Tato as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Zaichokanjin.html">Zaichokanjin</a> (the local officials in Heian and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> periods) who were such as Goji (a local government of official under <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Ritsuryo.html">ritsuryo</a> system) and hoji (an officer governing koryo, or public land) as their local government officials. Goji and Hoji paid certain amount of tax to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kokushi.html">kokushi</a>, and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kokushi.html">kokushi</a> paid certain amount of tax to Imperial Court respectively. </p>
<p>In this case, Goji were called <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Goshi (country samurai).html">Goshi</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shiki (a rank in government offices under ritsuryo system).html">shiki</a> (sub district headships) and Hoji were called <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Hoshi.html">Hoshi</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shiki (a rank in government offices under ritsuryo system).html">shiki</a> (executive officer of an Imperial demesne), and the difference between the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> and koryo on actual local land ruling apparently almost disappeared. 
<br/>The <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Share.html">share</a> that each <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shiki (a rank in government offices under ritsuryo system).html">shiki</a> had for taxes was called sakuai, and the stratified land ruling like this is called the '<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shiki (a rank in government offices under ritsuryo system).html">shiki</a> system.'<br/>
</p>
<p>In addition, recent studies question the concept of 'contribution with reserving authority' as the understanding of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shiki (a rank in government offices under ritsuryo system).html">shiki</a> system in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a>. <h3>Establishment</h3>
</p>
<p>By the 11the century, the manor regulation acts were often enforced in order to impose taxes for the purpose of rebuilding <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Dairi (the Imperial palace).html">dairi</a> (Imperial Palace) and main temples and shrines. Because of this, the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> that had existed before the acts came to be officially recognized as the subject to the extraordinary taxation, and measures to integrate the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> that had been scattered was taken. To the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> that enhanced its integrity by the enclosure measures, the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Myoden.html">myoden</a> system (field naming system) was adopted, and Ikkoku heikinyaku (taxes and labor uniformly imposed on <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> and kogugaryo (territory governed by provincial government office) in a province) to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kokugaryo.html">kokugaryo</a> came to be enforced. </p>
<p>In the 12th century, as a result of the reduction in tax revenue caused by the expansion of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a>, the Imperial Court was no longer able to pay salaries to high-ranked aristocrats, so it gave these nobles provinces as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Chigyo-koku.html">chigyo-koku</a> (provincial fiefdom), as well as the right to appoint <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kokushi.html">kokushi</a> (provincial governors) and collect taxes. Similarly, as for Imperial families, Ingu <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bunkoku.html">bunkoku</a> sei (provincial allotment system) was implemented, which means that the high-ranked aristocracy who were kenmon so (influential families), <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kokushi.html">kokushi</a> who were Juryoso (career provincial official class) and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> tato (powerful cultivators) who were Goji (local government official under the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Ritsuryo.html">ritsuryo</a> system) and hoji (an officer governing <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, or public land) were connected with each other and the structure in the case of the Imperial family showed almost no structural difference from the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> system. The system that <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kokugaryo.html">kokugaryo</a> (koryo) reorganized into gun (local district), go (sub local district), ho (Imperial demesne) worked as units for taxation were called <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> koryo sei (the system of public land and private estates). </p>
<p>The certified <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> lords collected Soyocho (a tax system, corvee), yo (tax in kind) and yoeki (corvee under <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Ritsuryo.html">Ritsuryo</a> system) in addition to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Jishi.html">jishi</a> (land tax) on rice fields, and similarly in koryo the taxation system was consolidated. The consolidated tax came to be called <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Nengu (Land Tax).html">nengu</a> (land tax). </p>
<p>With the establishment of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> koryo sei (the system of public lands and private estate), the local lords armed themselves to settle their land disputes and began to become <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a>. By the establishment of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>), in most cases <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> in Togoku (the eastern part of Japan, particularly Kanto region) became <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Gokenin.html">gokenin</a> (an immediate vassal of the shogunate in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> and Muromachi through Edo periods) to serve <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> and were appointed jito with their rights to rule their shoryo (territory) guaranteed by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>. At first there was no such thing as Jito <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shiki (a rank in government offices under ritsuryo system).html">shiki</a> (manager and lord of a private estate), but among <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shokan.html">shokan</a>, Goji and hoji only the ones who established the relationship between lord and vassal with the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> were called jito. However, after the Jokyu War, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> in which <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shokan.html">shokan</a> and jito stood abreast were also seen mainly in western Japan and, as described below, with the beginning of Jitouke (the contract system that manor's owner entrust a jito to manage his manor and pay the customs) the conception of Jito <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shiki (a rank in government offices under ritsuryo system).html">shiki</a> gradually took root. <h3>Transformation</h3>
</p>
<p>By the fact that the jito's rights to control local land ruling were guaranteed by the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> and the unstable legal status of jito to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kokushi.html">kokushi</a> seen in the scenes of local land ruling were stabilized, the jito tried to dissolve the existing relationship with the stratified land ruling, and came to direct the monistical land ruling. Such a monistical land ruling was called Ichien <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Chigyo.html">chigyo</a> (monistical ruling), and the Jitouke that jito undertook to collect <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Nengu (Land Tax).html">nengu</a> in place of shoenryoshu (lord of manor) or <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kokushi.html">kokushi</a> began. In this case, the rights of jito were called Jito <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shiki (a rank in government offices under ritsuryo system).html">shiki</a> (manager and lord of manor). In the meantime, in Saigoku (western part of Japan (esp. Kyushu, but ranging as far east as Kinki)) as the peasants strengthened their territorial bond and formed villages, Hyakushouke (the contract system that the manor's owner entrust a peasant to manage his manor and pay the customs) began to appear in addition to Jitouke. In addition, as a solution to dissolve disputes over sakuai (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Share.html">share</a> that each <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shiki (a rank in government offices under ritsuryo system).html">shiki</a> had for taxes) between jito and shoenryoshu, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shitaji chubun.html">Shitaji chubun</a> (physical division of the land) was started. </p>
<p>After the mid-Kamakura period, as a part of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Tokuseirei.html">Tokuseirei</a> (ordering return of land sold and dissolution of debts), shinryokogyorei (a policy to show divine shows based on thoughts of Confucianism in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period) were issued in succession based on the belief that it was by the grace of gods that <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Kamikaze.html">kamikaze</a> (divine wind) had blown at the Mongolian invasion attempts against Japan. By this, Ichien <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Chigyo.html">chigyo</a> was carried out not only from the side of jito but also from the side of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shokan.html">shokan</a> (an officer governing <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> (manor)) and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Ryoke.html">ryoke</a> (a lord of manor) toward the direction that it would tend to remove interference from <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Honjo (proprietor or guarantor of manor).html">honjo</a> (proprietor of guarantor of manor) and jito (manager and lord of manor). As a result of such movements, jito that held the right of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Ryoke.html">ryoke</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shiki (a rank in government offices under ritsuryo system).html">shiki</a> (as an economical right as a lord of manor) and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Ryoke.html">ryoke</a> that held Jitoshiki appeared, with the conventional structure beginning to collapse and the role of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Ryoke.html">ryoke</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shiki (a rank in government offices under ritsuryo system).html">shiki</a> or jito <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shiki (a rank in government offices under ritsuryo system).html">shiki</a> would greatly change. Moreover, at the Kenmu Restoration <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Honke.html">honke</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shiki (a rank in government offices under ritsuryo system).html">shiki</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Ryoke.html">ryoke</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shiki (a rank in government offices under ritsuryo system).html">shiki</a> in various provinces were abolished and Kansha (shrines) kaiho (liberation) edict was issued, therefore the monistical ruling was rapidly advanced. </p>
<p>Under such circumstances, the concept of territory of kuge (court noble) and territory of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> families took root and the provisions in the various laws on the premise of Ichien <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Chigyo.html">chigyo</a> began to appear. In the meantime, with the strengthened authority of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a> (provincial constable), aiming for the establishment of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shugo-ryogoku system.html">Shugo-ryogoku system</a> (the system that a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a> dominates a manor), <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a> lowered the social position of jito and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kokujin.html">kokujin</a> (local <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a>) of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Hikan (low ranking clerks).html">hikan</a> (low-level bureaucrat) and began to take over <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kokuga (provincial government office compounds).html">kokuga</a> (provincial government offices) and their territory. In this period, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shugouke.html">Shugouke</a>, the contract system that <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a> undertook <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Nengu (Land Tax).html">nengu</a> collection from <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> and koryo within <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a>'s territory for <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Honke.html">honke</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Ryoke.html">ryoke</a>, and chigyo-kokushu (provincial proprietor) was spreading, and such a right was called <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shiki (a rank in government offices under ritsuryo system).html">shiki</a>. </p>
<p>By this period, the right to cultivate by sakunin (local cultivators) was established as saku-shiki (the right of the cultivator), and the formation of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Soson (a community comprising a self-governing association of peasants).html">soson</a> (a community consisting of peasants' self-governing association) began to appear. Moreover, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shiki (a rank in government offices under ritsuryo system).html">shiki</a> itself became mere tokubunken (the right to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Share.html">share</a> of profits of each <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shiki (a rank in government offices under ritsuryo system).html">shiki</a>) from the one indicating the class difference, and the cases that <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Honke.html">honke</a> (head family) and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Ryoke.html">ryoke</a> held the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shiki (a rank in government offices under ritsuryo system).html">shiki</a> containing the feature of local lords and vice versa came to be seen. In addition, by Muromachi <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>'s structure to harmonize the interests of court noble and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a>, the reorganization of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> was advanced by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shitaji chubun.html">Shitaji chubun</a> (physical division of the land) etc., and ichienryo (ichien territory) and bukeichienryo (ichien territory of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> families) took hold. <h3>Decline</h3>
</p>
<p>In the Sengoku period (period of warring states) <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> (Japanese territorial lord) in the Sengoku period who took over <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shugo daimyo.html">Shugo daimyo</a> (Japanese territorial lord as provincial constable) further advanced Ichien <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Chigyo.html">chigyo</a>, and the manorism collapsed. </p>
<p>Eventually, by taiko <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kenchi.html">kenchi</a> (the cadastral surveys conducted by Hideyoshi), only the right of direct cultivator was admitted to the land, and the previous stratified ruling structure disappeared both in name and reality. </p>
