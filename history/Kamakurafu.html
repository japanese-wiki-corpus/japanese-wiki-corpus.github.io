<h1>Kamakurafu (鎌倉府)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The Kamakurafu was a government office which the Muromachi <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>) established in the Northern and Southern courts period and the Muromachi period for the purpose of ruling the Kanto region. </p>
<p>Its origin was the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> shogunfu headed by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Imperial Prince Nariyoshi.html">Imperial Prince Nariyoshi</a>, a prince of Emperor Godaigo, which Emperor Godaigo established, as a part of the Kenmu Restoration, for the purpose of ruling the Kanto region. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Tadayoshi ASHIKAGA.html">Tadayoshi ASHIKAGA</a> seized real power instead of a very young prince, and it later became the local office of the Muromachi <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> in the Kanto region. When the Kanno Disturbance occurred, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Takauji ASHIKAGA.html">Takauji ASHIKAGA</a> dispatched his son <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Motouji ASHIKAGA.html">Motouji ASHIKAGA</a> to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a>. Since then, Motouji's descendants inherited the top post of the Kamakurafu (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> kubo) and the Uesugi clan supported <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> kubo as Kanto <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kanrei.html">kanrei</a> (a shogunal deputy for Kanto region) for generations. </p>
<p>Its original jurisdiction included the Kanto region, Izu Province and Kai Province, and Mutsu Province and Dewa province were added in 1392. The <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> kubo Ashikaga clan and the Kanto kanrei Uesugi clan became at odds, and the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Eikyo War.html">Eikyo War</a> occurred in 1439, where the Kanto <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kanrei.html">kanrei</a> sided with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshinori ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshinori ASHIKAGA</a>. As the fourth <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> kubo, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Mochiuji ASHIKAGA.html">Mochiuji ASHIKAGA</a> was defeated and killed in this war, and the top of the Kamakurafu became vacant for a while. </p>
<p>Although Shigeuji ASHIKAGA, a bereaved son of Mochiuji, became <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> kubo, he was forced by the Uesugi clan and the Imagawa clan to move to Koga palace (Koga kubo) after he caused the Kyotoku War. As <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Masatomo ASHIKAGA.html">Masatomo ASHIKAGA</a> (Yoshinori's son), who was appointed in place of Shigeuji, was based at Horikoshi palace (Horikoshi kubo) in Izu Province due to a feud with the Uesugi clan, the Kamakurafu ceased to exist in effect. </p>
