<h1>Ryoji (令旨)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Ryoji refers to a document issued under the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ritsuryo.html">Ritsuryo</a> system (a system of centralized government based on the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ritsuryo.html">ritsuryo</a> code by princes, empresses, etc.) for conveying orders of princes and three sango (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Grand Empress Dowager.html">Grand Empress Dowager</a>, Empress Dowager, and Empress). </p>
<p>In China (Tong), a document intended to convey orders of princes was called ryo, which was introduced into Japan. In Japan, such a document for conveying orders of princes came to be called ryoji, which also include documents issued by the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Grand Empress Dowager.html">Grand Empress Dowager</a>, Empress Dowager, and Empress. In and after the mid Heian period, ryoji started to cover documents issued by other imperial families (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Nyoin (a close female relative of the Emperor or a womwan of comparable standing).html">nyoin</a> (a close female relative of the Emperor or a woman of comparable standing), Princesses, and Shoo (princes who didn't receive any proclamation to be an Imperial Prince) in addition to princes and sango. </p>
<p>A historically famous ryoji is '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Prince Mochihito.html">Prince Mochihito</a>'s order' issued to justify the Genji's raising of an army during the Genpei War. </p>
<p>Documents that convey imperial orders include imperial decrees and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Rinji (the Emperors command).html">rinji</a> (the Emperor's command). </p>
