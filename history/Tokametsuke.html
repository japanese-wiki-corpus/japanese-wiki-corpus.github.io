<h1>Tokametsuke (灯火目付)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Tokametsuke was one of the physical trainings of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Ninja (professional spy in feudal Japan highly trained in stealth and secrecy).html">Ninja</a> (a secret agent in feudal Japan highly skilled in stealth and secrecy). It was used to improve eyesight. In Tokametsuke, an Andon (a paper-covered lamp stand) was lit in a dark room, and a reasonable number of holes were pricked on its parts made of Washi (Japanese paper), and from a distance, the numbers of those holes were counted. The exercise was carried out every day, and gradually the numbers of the holes were increased. </p>
<p>Another method which was passed down for improving eyesight was to repeatedly come and go between a dark room or a closet and a bright room. </p>
<p>The <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Ninja (professional spy in feudal Japan highly trained in stealth and secrecy).html">Ninja</a> were considered to have improved their eyesight not only through the methods described above, but also through the ingestion of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Sansho (Japanese pepper).html">Sansho</a> (Japanese pepper). </p>
