<p>It is also called 'Okindachi no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Tsukasa (a rank in government offices).html">tsukasa</a>.'<br/>

Before the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ritsuryo.html">Ritsuryo</a> system, there was no such institution and it is considered to have imitated the Court of the Imperial Clan (Zongzheng Si) in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ritsuryo.html">Ritsuryo</a> system during the Tang Dynasty. To control the name list of Imperial families, princes were often appointed to Kami, who was an administrator, during the Nara period and after the Heian period the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Shirakawa (the surroundings of the old capital, Kyoto).html">Shirakawa</a> family (Kazan-Genji [Minamoto clan], the Hakuo family) were appointed for generations.

Aristocrats served as 'betto' to administer the institution and in many cases the post was under the control of 'ryo' (bureau), and only Naizen no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Tsukasa (a rank in government offices).html">tsukasa</a> (Imperial Table Office) other than <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Okimi (great king) (Yamato sovereignty).html">Okimi</a> no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Tsukasa (a rank in government offices).html">tsukasa</a> had the position of 'betto' among others. For this reason, the institution was an important one for a long time. <h3>Personnel</h3>
