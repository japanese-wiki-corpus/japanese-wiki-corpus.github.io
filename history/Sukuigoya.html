<h1>Sukuigoya (救小屋)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Sukuigoya is a public shelter of the Edo Period, built by the Edo shogunate or local feudal domain for victims of earthquakes, fire, floods, famine and other natural disasters. It is also known as osukuigoya. </p>
<p>Summary<br/>
Although such shelters were built in various feudal domains, shelters built in urban area such as Edo and Osaka were exceptionally large in scale, because which should accommodate refugees evaded from other provinces. Since the influx of such people from rural region into urban area was linked directly to rise in crime, these shelters were administered by the machi-bugyo (town magistrate) for the purpose of safety and security of the Edo city. These shelters provided accommodations, as well as supply of rice and assistance in finding work. </p>
