<h1>Shisetsu Jungyo (使節遵行)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Shisetsu jungyo was a on-site procedure to carry out a judgment which was handed down by the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>) on shoryo soron (litigation over real estate) in the medieval Japan. The system of shisetsu jungyo began in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period. At the beginning of the Muromachi period, the shisetsu jungyo was included in the capacity and power of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a> (provincial constable). This resulted in the expanded power of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a> and creating an opportunity for <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shugo daimyo.html">Shugo daimyo</a> (Japanese territorial lord as provincial constable) to emerge and construct <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shugo-ryogoku system.html">Shugo-ryogoku system</a> (a system in which a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a> dominates a manor). </p>
<p><h3>History</h3>
</p>
<p>As the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period began, in addition to the currently existing laws and ordinances of the dynasty (the Imperial court and Court nobles), such as court noble law and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Honjo (proprietor or guarantor of manor).html">honjo</a> law (a law to govern manor in the medieval Japan), the newly established <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> instituted <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">Samurai</a> laws which was unique to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> families by collecting legal precedents after the inauguration of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Yoritomo.html">MINAMOTO no Yoritomo</a>, the udaisho (Major Captain of the Right Division of Inner Palace Guards) family, and formulating <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Goseibai-shikimoku (code of conduct for samurai).html">Goseibai-shikimoku</a> (code of conduct for <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a>). On the other hand, there was a tendency that <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a>, even after the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> judged in the lawsuit over the right of fief, which was called <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shomusata (trial dealing with land-related issues).html">shomusata</a> (trial dealing with land-related issues), not necessarily followed the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>'s judgment but tried to keep their right to manage the territory using their force with the aid of the customary practice of self-help which had been approved in the society at that time. </p>
<p>Then, the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> decided to compulsorily execute their judgment over the shoryo soron on site by sending a pair of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Gokenin.html">gokenin</a> (an immediate vassal of the shogunate)whose position had been neutral in the dispute. The <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Gokenin.html">gokenin</a> who had been sent for the site was called ryoshi. That was the origin of shisetsu jungyo. </p>
<p>In the late <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period, some cases emerged in which the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">Bakufu</a>, instead of sending ryoshi directly, sent shigyojo (a letter conveying orders from the head to the subjects) to a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a>, who in turn selected an envoy and carried out this procedure based on the shigyojo. </p>
<p>In 1346 of the early Muromachi period, while the battle between the Southern and Northern Dynasties had been going on, the Muromachi <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> contemplated securing public order by strengthening the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a>'s authorities and enacted laws which directly granted the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a> the right to judge criminal cases for shisetsu jungyo and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Karita-rozeki.html">Karita-rozeki</a> (to reap rice illegally). This allowed the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a> to send an envoy to the site, and carry out a transfer of the right to manage the territory and an eviction, in order to put the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">Bakufu</a>'s judgment into effect. Since then, the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a> acquired the right to intervene in disputes over territory within their province and gradually increased their domination over <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> (manor) and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kokugaryo.html">Kokugaryo</a> (territories governed by provincial government office). Additionally, the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a> put jito (manager and lord of manor), the local lord, and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Myoshu.html">myoshu</a> (owner of rice fields) under their influence by adopting them into <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Hikan (low ranking clerks).html">hikan</a> (low-level bureaucrat). Thus, in the Muromachi period, the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a> grew into the status of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shugo daimyo.html">Shugo daimyo</a> (Japanese territorial lord as provincial constable), and a ruling system called <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shugo-ryogoku system.html">Shugo-ryogoku system</a> (the system that a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a> dominates a manor) was instituted. </p>
<p>Since the late <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period when the system of shisetsu jungyo began, the expenses associated with the shisetsu jungyo was at the lord of the manor's. </p>
