<h1>Nakatsukasa-sho (中務省)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Nakatsukasa-sho (Ministry of Central Affairs, "中務省" in the Chinese characters) was a government-regulated organization under the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ritsuryo.html">Ritsuryo</a> system (a system of centralized government based on the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ritsuryo.html">ritsuryo</a> codes). 
<br/>It was also called by a Japanese name, 'Naka no matsurigoto no tukasa.'<br/>
The Chinese character '中' of "中務省" has a meaning of the Imperial Court. </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>Nakatsukasa-sho was regarded as the most important ministry among the eight central ministries, because it administered all duties related to the Imperial Court, such as assisting the Emperor, proclaiming the imperial edict, conferring the court rank. There is a theory that Nakatsukasa-sho along with Kunai-sho (Ministry of the Sovereign's Household) was ranked higher than other six ministries before the establishment of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Taiho Ritsuryo (Taiho Code).html">Taiho Ritsuryo</a> (Taiho Code). </p>
<p>Therefore, the Nakatsukasa-Kyo (corresponding to Shoshiinojo [Senior Fourth Rank Upper Grade]), the Secretary of Nakatsukasa-sho, was conventionally chosen from the Imperial Princes with a rank equivalent to or higher than Shihon (the fourth rank of Imperial Princes' rank) exclusively in and after the Heian period. Even if the post became vacant, it remained unfilled until an Imperial Prince suitable for the post appeared. </p>
<p>This ministry had to cover extensive duties, because it managed the general clerical works related to the Imperial Court from enforcement of the imperial edict to the personnel affairs concerning court ladies in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kokyu (empresss residence).html">Kokyu</a> (empress's residence). Therefore, in addition to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shitokan (four classifications of bureaucrats ranks).html">Shitokan</a> (four classifications of bureaucrats' ranks, the official court ranks conferred to the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shitokan (four classifications of bureaucrats ranks).html">Shitokan</a> of Nakatsukasa-sho were higher than <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shitokan (four classifications of bureaucrats ranks).html">Shitokan</a> in other ministries) consisting of Suke, Jo and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Sakan (Kokushi).html">Sakan</a>, the following posts were counted among <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Honkan.html">Honkan</a> (government posts): Jiju (chamberlain); officials attending the Emperor, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Udoneri (government post).html">Udoneri</a> (Ministerial equerry); officials taking charge of the Imperial Court defense and miscellaneous jobs and guarding an imperial visit, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Naiki (government posts).html">Naiki</a> and others; officials engaged in drafting the two types of imperial edict (one was written in the classical Chinese and the other was in the Japanese syllabary) and the court rank diploma, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kenmotsu (officials belonging to Nakatsukasasho).html">Kenmotsu</a> and others; officials engaged in accounts of Okura-sho (Ministry of the Treasury), Kura-ryo (Bureau of Palace Storehouses), etc., <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shurei (officials belonging to Nakatsukasasho).html">Shurei</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Tenyaku (government post).html">Tenyaku</a>; officials managing <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ekirei.html">Ekirei</a> (bells set in stations used for supplying horses), Denfu (certification for lending horses), etc. Meanwhile, the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Udoneri (government post).html">Udoneri</a> guarding the Emperor and the Jiju, attendants of the Emperor, was obliged to wear a sword. </p>
<p>Government offices under high-ranked offices in Nakatsukasa-sho were categorized into one-shiki (the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ritsuryo.html">Ritsuryo</a> system), six-ryo (the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ritsuryo.html">Ritsuryo</a> system) and three-shi under the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ritsuryo.html">Ritsuryo</a> system. However, this system was later streamlined to decrease the number of categories to one-shiki and six-ryo. <h3>The quota of the posts equivalent to or lower than Taifu (Vice-Minister)</h3>
</p>
<p>The quota of the posts in this ministry equivalent to or lower than Taifu was as follows. </p>
