<h1>Nakatsukasa-sho (中務省)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Nakatsukasa-sho (Ministry of Central Affairs, "中務省" in the Chinese characters) was a government-regulated organization under the Ritsuryo system (a system of centralized government based on the ritsuryo codes). 
<br/>It was also called by a Japanese name, 'Naka no matsurigoto no tukasa.'<br/>
The Chinese character '中' of "中務省" has a meaning of the Imperial Court. </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>Nakatsukasa-sho was regarded as the most important ministry among the eight central ministries, because it administered all duties related to the Imperial Court, such as assisting the Emperor, proclaiming the imperial edict, conferring the court rank. There is a theory that Nakatsukasa-sho along with Kunai-sho (Ministry of the Sovereign's Household) was ranked higher than other six ministries before the establishment of Taiho Ritsuryo (Taiho Code). </p>
<p>Therefore, the Nakatsukasa-Kyo (corresponding to Shoshiinojo [Senior Fourth Rank Upper Grade]), the Secretary of Nakatsukasa-sho, was conventionally chosen from the Imperial Princes with a rank equivalent to or higher than Shihon (the fourth rank of Imperial Princes' rank) exclusively in and after the Heian period. Even if the post became vacant, it remained unfilled until an Imperial Prince suitable for the post appeared. </p>
<p>This ministry had to cover extensive duties, because it managed the general clerical works related to the Imperial Court from enforcement of the imperial edict to the personnel affairs concerning court ladies in Kokyu (empress's residence). Therefore, in addition to Shitokan (four classifications of bureaucrats' ranks, the official court ranks conferred to the Shitokan of Nakatsukasa-sho were higher than Shitokan in other ministries) consisting of Suke, Jo and Sakan, the following posts were counted among Honkan (government posts): Jiju (chamberlain); officials attending the Emperor, Udoneri (Ministerial equerry); officials taking charge of the Imperial Court defense and miscellaneous jobs and guarding an imperial visit, Naiki and others; officials engaged in drafting the two types of imperial edict (one was written in the classical Chinese and the other was in the Japanese syllabary) and the court rank diploma, Kenmotsu and others; officials engaged in accounts of Okura-sho (Ministry of the Treasury), Kura-ryo (Bureau of Palace Storehouses), etc., Shurei and Tenyaku; officials managing Ekirei (bells set in stations used for supplying horses), Denfu (certification for lending horses), etc. Meanwhile, the Udoneri guarding the Emperor and the Jiju, attendants of the Emperor, was obliged to wear a sword. </p>
<p>Government offices under high-ranked offices in Nakatsukasa-sho were categorized into one-shiki (the Ritsuryo system), six-ryo (the Ritsuryo system) and three-shi under the Ritsuryo system. However, this system was later streamlined to decrease the number of categories to one-shiki and six-ryo. <h3>The quota of the posts equivalent to or lower than Taifu (Vice-Minister)</h3>
