<h1>Funaokayama-gassen (船岡山合戦)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The Funaokayama-gassen (Battle at Mt. Funaoka) refers to a battle on September 25, 1511, between <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Takakuni HOSOKAWA.html">Takakuni HOSOKAWA</a> along with OUCHI Yoshioki who supported <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshitane ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshitane ASHIKAGA</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Sumimoto HOSOKAWA.html">Sumimoto HOSOKAWA</a> who support former <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshizumi ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshizumi ASHIKAGA</a>. It was a power struggle over the Muromachi <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>). It is also called 'the Battle of Funaokayama in the Eisho era' in order to differentiate from the battle which broke out at Funaokayama during the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Onin War.html">Onin War</a>. </p>
<p><h3>Details on the outbreak of the war</h3>
</p>
<p>Having expelled <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Seii Taishogun.html">Seii Taishogun</a> (literally, "great general who subdues the barbarians") Yoshiki ASHIKAGA on the Coup of Meio in 1493, Shogunal Deputy <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Masamoto HOSOKAWA.html">Masamoto HOSOKAWA</a> flaunted his enormous power under Yoshizumi (Yoshitaka) ASHIKAGA whom he supported. However, because Masamoto had no biological child, he adopted three sons -Sumiyuki HOSOKAWA, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Sumimoto HOSOKAWA.html">Sumimoto HOSOKAWA</a>, and Takakuni HOSOKAWA- who later disputed each other as successor. </p>
<p>On June 23, 1507, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Masamoto HOSOKAWA.html">Masamoto HOSOKAWA</a> was assassinated by HOSOKAWA Sumiyuki's senior vassals, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Motonaga KOZAI.html">Motonaga KOZAI</a>, Nagatada YAKUSHIJI, et al (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Eisho Disturbance.html">Eisho Disturbance</a>). Although <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Sumimoto HOSOKAWA.html">Sumimoto HOSOKAWA</a>'s residence was also attacked and Sumimoto once escaped to Koga-gun <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Omi Province.html">Omi Province</a>, he gained strength back with the help of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kokujin.html">Kokujin</a> (local <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a>). On September 17 of that year, he invaded <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and caught <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Sumiyuki HOSOKAWA.html">Sumiyuki HOSOKAWA</a> and his supporters. On August second, he had an approval of the eleventh <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshizumi ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshizumi ASHIKAGA</a> to succeed the HOSOKAWA clan. </p>
<p>However, former Shogun Yoshitada ASHIKAGA (Yoshiki) took advantage of the confusion, intending his return to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. He headed to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> with Sengoku-daimyo (Japanese territorial lord during the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Sengoku Period (period of warring states) (Japan).html">Sengoku Period</a>) <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshioki OUCHI.html">Yoshioki OUCHI</a> of Suo Province. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Takakuni HOSOKAWA.html">Takakuni HOSOKAWA</a> acted in concert with this. Then <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshizumi ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshizumi ASHIKAGA</a> fled to Okayama-jo Castle in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Omi Province.html">Omi Province</a>, and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Sumimoto HOSOKAWA.html">Sumimoto HOSOKAWA</a> who supported Yoshizumi fled to Omi and ultimately to Awa Province. Yoshitada ASHIKAGA, who won the battle, changed his name to Yoshitane and reinstated as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a>; a coalition government of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Takakuni HOSOKAWA.html">Takakuni HOSOKAWA</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshioki OUCHI.html">Yoshioki OUCHI</a> was formed. </p>
<p>Although <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshizumi ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshizumi ASHIKAGA</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Sumimoto HOSOKAWA.html">Sumimoto HOSOKAWA</a> aimed at rehabilitation, they were defeated at the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Battle of Nyoigatake.html">Battle of Nyoigatake</a> in 1509. Then, they prepared and in 1511, mustered various groups in Kinai, counterattacked, and recovered the capital. They once made <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshitane ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshitane ASHIKAGA</a> and his people flee to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Tanba (train).html">Tanba</a> province. However, Yoshitane and his people gradually regained power and were getting around the capital again. <h3>The situation of the battle</h3>
</p>
<p>Just before the outbreak of the battle, an internal conflict had occurred in the Rokkaku clan of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Omi Province.html">Omi Province</a> who supported <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshizumi ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshizumi ASHIKAGA</a>. As a result, Takayori ROKKAKU, family head of the ROKKAKU, revolted to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshitane ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshitane ASHIKAGA</a>'s side, despite the Iba clan, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shugodai.html">shugodai</a> (deputy of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a>, provincial constable), who insisted to assist Yoshizumi's side. Moreover, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshizumi ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshizumi ASHIKAGA</a>, the leader of the alliance, learned of the situation and died from an illness in despair. It was a serious incident. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Sumimoto HOSOKAWA.html">Sumimoto HOSOKAWA</a> and his people did not lose the will to fight; they attempted a turf war at Mt. Funaoka, which was a strategic <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Point (Sentoki).html">point</a> in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Tanba (train).html">Tanba</a> and Yamashiro Province, with Masataka HOSOKAWA, who was in their side, as a captain. </p>
<p>However, Ouchi's forces, which included most <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kokujin.html">Kokujin</a> in Saigoku (western part of Japan - esp. Kyushu, but ranging as far east as Kinki), were mighty. When Takakuni's side, including the Ouchi's forces, attacked at night, Masataka HOSOKAWA was killed in the battle, and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Sumimoto HOSOKAWA.html">Sumimoto HOSOKAWA</a>'s force completely collapsed. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> was again fell into <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshitane ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshitane ASHIKAGA</a>'s hands. <h3>Impact of the battle</h3>
</p>
<p>Having lost the battle, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Sumimoto HOSOKAWA.html">Sumimoto HOSOKAWA</a> fled to Awa where his parents lived and continued to resist with the support of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yukinaga MIYOSHI.html">Yukinaga MIYOSHI</a>, aiming at recovery. Although he succeeded in recovering the capital for a short time, he finally went to ruin after all. Yoshizumi's children were entrusted to Yoshimura AKAMATSU in Harima and Yukimochi HOSOKAWA in Awa. The children were later called <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshiharu ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshiharu ASHIKAGA</a> and Yoshitsuna ASHIKAGA (Hirashima kubo). </p>
<p>As for <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshioki OUCHI.html">Yoshioki OUCHI</a> who won the battle, while he remained in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> for a long time, there were disturbing trends in Izumo Province caused by the Amako clan, the Takeda clan, etc. Moreover, because many <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kokujin.html">Kokujin</a> (local <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a>) seceded from him, he returned to Suo in 1518. Since then, he had been busy with regaining the power and died from illness in 1529 without going to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> again. </p>
<p><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Takakuni HOSOKAWA.html">Takakuni HOSOKAWA</a> opposed to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshitane ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshitane ASHIKAGA</a> after a while, expelled <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshitane ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshitane ASHIKAGA</a> in 1521, and backed <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshizumi ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshizumi ASHIKAGA</a>'s son, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshiharu ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshiharu ASHIKAGA</a>, to become <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a>. Then he opposed to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Sumimoto HOSOKAWA.html">Sumimoto HOSOKAWA</a>'s son <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Harumoto HOSOKAWA.html">Harumoto HOSOKAWA</a> and lost the Battle of Tenno-ji, as known as Daimotsu-kuzure (Battle of Daimotsu) in 1531. Finally, Takakuni himself went to ruin. <h3><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Busho.html">Busho</a> of Yoshitane's side</h3>
</p>
<p>As core <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Busho.html">busho</a> on Yoshitane's side, there were Captain <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Takakuni HOSOKAWA.html">Takakuni HOSOKAWA</a>, OUCHI Yoshioki, and Yoshimoto HATAKEYAMA of Noto Province. The Kawachi Hatakeyama clan (the Bishu family) who had supported Yoshitane since the Coup of Meio was also thought to be with Yoshitane; however, the fact is unknown. Takamori TOIDA and Okifusa SUE who were great vassals of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshioki OUCHI.html">Yoshioki OUCHI</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Tsunehisa AMAGO.html">Tsunehisa AMAGO</a>, a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kokujin.html">kokujin</a> ryoshu (local <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> lord) who later opposed in Chugoku region, Kunitsune KIKKAWA, Okimoto MORI (elder brother of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Motonari MORI.html">Motonari MORI</a>), Yorioki YOSHIMI and others had joined the forces of OUCHI Yoshioki. <h3><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Busho.html">Busho</a> on Yoshizumi's side</h3>
</p>
<p>As <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Busho.html">busho</a> on Yoshizumi's side, there were many great vassals of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>, such as captain <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Sumimoto HOSOKAWA.html">Sumimoto HOSOKAWA</a>, Masataka HOSOKAWA and Yorisuke MATSUDA. There were also feudal lords, such as Yoshihide HATAKEYAMA of the Kawachi Hatakeyama clan (Soshu family), who opposed Hisanobu in Kawachi, and Yoshimura AKAMATSU of Harima. </p>
<p>It is thought that the Awa Hosokawa family, who were the parents' family of Sumimoto, and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yukinaga MIYOSHI.html">Yukinaga MIYOSHI</a> their influential <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Hikan (low ranking clerks).html">hikan</a> (low-level bureaucrat) were naturally on the side of Yoshizumi. However, Nariyuki HOSOKAWA, Sumimoto's grandfather and conservator, died of an illness right after this battle, and Yukinaga was no condition to move. Their involvement in the battle is uncertain. Moreover, it has been known that there was 'Yusa, the Governor of Kawachi Province' who joined Yoshizumi's force and killed himself. He is often considered to be Nobumori YUSA who was a vassal of the Hatakeyama Bishu family. However, it is thought that Nobumori was not Yusa, the Governor of Kawachi Province, because it has become clear that there was a group of the Yusa clan among <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kokujin.html">Kokujin</a> who supported the Soshu family, and because Hisanobu was politically dominant over Yoshihide after the battle, driving Yoshihide into ruin. </p>
