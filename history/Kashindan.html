<p>The term Kashindan refers to the group of vassals serving <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> families, such as the family of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Seii Taishogun.html">Seii Taishogun</a> (literally, a general who subsides barbarians) or a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> (Japanese territorial lord). </p>
<p><h3>The relationship between master and vassal until the medieval period</h3>
</p>
<p>Until the medieval period, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> within a master and vassal relationship who were subordinate to a Bumon no toryo (leader of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> families) were called <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kenin.html">Kenin</a>. Most <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kenin.html">Kenin</a> during the Heian period were descendants of a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Gunji.html">Gunji</a> (local magistrate) or Dogo (local powerful clan) and were engaged in the administration of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kokufu.html">Kokufu</a> (provincial government office) as local officials. Meanwhile, they evaded heavy taxes imposed by the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kokufu.html">Kokufu</a> and prevented intervention by the Imperial Court by donating <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> (manor) to Ingu oshinke (a general term for Imperial families and nobilities) and influential temples and shrines. At the same time, they rendered homage and service to a Bumon no toryo, who held great provincial power due to their noble bloodline and close relationship with the Imperial Court and powerful nobilities; they did so in return for honryo-ando (acknowledgement of inherited territories) so that they could get out of trouble under the protection of the Bumon no toryo in the event of military attack. In other words, many local <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> managed to secure independence, survival and opportunities to expand their territory by establishing multiple relationships with powerful and influential individuals who shared mutual interests. As the relationship between master and vassal among <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> was highly dependent on interests, at times vassals would abandon a Bumon no toryo, if and when they came under an unfavorable situation due to a war and changed loyalty to the opponent. As such, the relationship between master and vassal among <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> was not absolute. The situation did not change even after the establishment of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>) as the first military government. </p>
<p>As it became the Muromachi period, the relationship between master and vassal among <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> became comparably stronger to earlier times. Many <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> descendants of a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a> (military governor) during the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period were appointed to the position again by the Muromachi <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>. They obtained the authority to impose taxes on <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> based on new systems like <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Hanzei (Half Payment of Taxes).html">hanzei</a> (a system under which <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a> were allowed to collect half of the taxes from <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a>) and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shugouke.html">shugouke</a> (the contract system under which the owner of a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> entrusted a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a> to manage their <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> and pay customs). At the same time, they made the descendents of a Jito (military land steward) called <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kokujin.html">Kokujin</a> ryoshu (local <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a>) their subordinates, acquired the authority to collect taxes from <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> owned by Ingu oshinke, temples and shrines, and strengthened their power base. A number of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kokujin.html">Kokujin</a> ryoshu protected themselves from intervention by a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a> or checked the movements of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a> by obtaining the status of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Hokoshu.html">hokoshu</a> (a military post of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>). Conversely, some obtained the position of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugodai.html">Shugodai</a> (deputy of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a>), or other official positions by serving the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a>, through the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a> or the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>. In this case, they protected themselves from outside enemies or justified their ruling authority based on their positions. </p>
<p>On the other hand, strengthening the ruling power of a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a> or <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kokujin.html">Kokujin</a> was not necessarily accomplished smoothly, due to vassals often changing loyalty to other <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a> or rebelled against a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a> in an alliance with another <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kokujin.html">Kokujin</a>. In terms of tax collection as well, taxes could not be collected from <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shoen.html">Shoen</a> after they obtained the right of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shugoshi funyu.html">Shugoshi funyu</a> (a right to reject the entrance of a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a>) and they had no way to collect money without embezzling illegally. In the case of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kokujin.html">Kokujin</a> ryoshu, their relationship with clan members, branch families and Dogo under their rule was similar to an alliance, rather than a relationship of master and vassal; in this sense, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kokujin.html">Kokujin</a> ryoshu were more akin to leaders rather than masters. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kokujin.html">Kokujin</a> were therefore unable to neglect the intentions of their branch families and Dogo. In some cases, subordinates of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kokujin.html">Kokujin</a> became independent <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kokujin.html">Kokujin</a> by appealing to the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> or the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a>. When conflict of interests occurred, some branch families went so far as to publicly rebel against the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kokujin.html">Kokujin</a> and engage in battle. As shown above, the relationship of master and vassal among <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> until the medieval period was based only on the common interests of both parties and was not absolute. <h3>Sengoku <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> (Japanese territorial lord in the Sengoku period (period of Warring States)) and Kashindan</h3>
</p>
<p>The importance of common interests in a relationship of master and vassal did not change in the Sengoku period. Rather, it was even more apparent when vassals began changing masters in the event of a serious conflict of interest and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Gekokujo.html">Gekokujo</a> (a revolt of vassals against their lords) became a matter of course. The big difference between the Sengoku <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> and the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shugo daimyo.html">Shugo daimyo</a> (military governors), <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugodai.html">Shugodai</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kokujin.html">Kokujin</a> ryoshu from the Muromachi period, however, was in whether or not they could organize strong Kashindan. </p>
<p>Unlike their counterparts in the medieval period, Sengoku <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> actively appointed capable vassals to important positions. Generally presiding over the politics of a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> family were clan members, branch families, relatives, powerful <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kokujin.html">Kokujin</a> and vassals who were descendants of the Dogo. Within the Kashindan under a Sengoku <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a>, however, there was a trend to give promotions based on abilities; this was seen in the case of Hideyoshi HASHIBA (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI.html">Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI</a>) who had been born from a peasant family, became an <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Ashigaru.html">ashigaru</a> (common foot soldier) and was promoted to a vassal by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Nobunaga ODA.html">Nobunaga ODA</a>, a Sengoku <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> in Owari Province. On the other hand, there were also conflicts between hereditary vassals, who held their status based on bloodline or traditional master-vassal relationships, and individuals who were newly appointed due to their abilities. </p>
<p>In the late Sengoku period, powerful Sengoku <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> brought their vassals into complete subordination, whereas before they had been independent to a certain degree and were able to refuse orders depending on the circumstances. Sengoku <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> constructed castle towns, giving residences to their vassals and families inside the towns in order to prevent revolts and indigenization. After <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI.html">Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI</a> became a Kanpaku (chief adviser to the Emperor), a policy called <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Heinobunri.html">heinobunri</a> (separation of warrior class from the soil of its territory) was implemented. As a result of the policy, vassals who had been engaged in agriculture in their territories in times of peace became full-time bureaucrats or warriors. This caused a change in the relationship between vassals and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a>; whereas vassals formerly went to the castle to work when necessary, under the new policy they were required to work in the castle every day. <h3>Since the Edo period</h3>
</p>
<p>During the Edo period when the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> held absolute authority, relations between Kinsei <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> (early modern lords), who were Jikishin (great vassals), and their Kashindan, who were <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Baishin (indirect vassal).html">Baishin</a> (indirect vassals), became a categorical master-subordinate relationship. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">Daimyo</a> adopted a horoku (salary) system in place of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Chigyo.html">chigyo</a> system (a system under which vassals were entitled and given the right to rule the land) and monopolized the right to rule the land. Under these circumstances, the nature of Kashindan changed from a group of ryoshu (feudal lords) to a group of employees serving a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> family. As it became a peaceful period, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> became increasingly bureaucratic, not only due to vassals being given important positions when they excelled in governance instead of in military affairs, but because of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Heinobunri.html">heinobunri</a> policy implemented in the Azuchi-Momoyama period and the adoption of the horoku system in the Edo period as well. This resulted in the nature of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> changing from ryoshu to bureaucrats and officials. </p>
