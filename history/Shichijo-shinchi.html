<h1>Shichijo-shinchi (七条新地)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Shichijo-shinchi was once a brothel in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Shimogyo Ward.html">Shimogyo Ward</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a> and today it continues its business under its new name, "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Gojo Rakuen.html">Gojo Rakuen</a>." </p>
<p>It was said that Shichijo-shinchi brothel was originally a chaya (teahouse) of boiled foods founded on the land reclaimed from the riverside fields in the middle of the Edo period. It flourished as the biggest brothel in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> during the later Edo period and the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period, and in the Taisho period it owned rows of three-storey buildings. The largest number of women working in Shichijo-shinchi were prostitutes and a small number of geisha girls were there, but in the early Showa period, there were no geisha girls. </p>
<p>After the World War II, Shichijo-shinchi was designated as the red-light district and closed down in 1958 when Anti-Prostitution Law took effect. Shichijo-shinchi then changed its name to "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Gojo Rakuen.html">Gojo Rakuen</a>" and has been an entertainment house specializing geisha girls. 
<br/>(However, they still do their original business on some occasions.)<br/>
