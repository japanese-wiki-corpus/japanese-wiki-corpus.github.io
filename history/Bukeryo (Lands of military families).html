<p></p>
<p>Bukeryo was shoryo (individual holdings) of military families during the medieval Japan. </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>The bukeryo included from individual holdings owned by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> (warriors) retainers to individual holdings owned by the Ise Heishi (a branch of the Taira clan) and the Kawachi Genji (a branch of the Minamoto family), each a chief of the warrior houses, based on their military authority. Local <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> warriors including the Ise Heishi clan and the Kawachi Genji, both originating from middle and lower ranked officials, were qualified as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> ryoshu (proprietary lord of manor) in their local power base. Among others, the Ise Heishi formed its economic foundation by receiving chigyokoku and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> throughout Japan in the process of establishing the Taira administration, which culminated in ruling of thirty or more chigyokoku and 500 or more <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a>. The Kawachi Genji received nine provinces (Shimousa Province, Kazusa Province, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Musashi Province.html">Musashi Province</a>, Sagami Province, Izu Province, Echigo Province, Shinano Province, Suruga Province, Bungo Province) among those that had been the Ise Heishi's chigyokoku, and 500 or more <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a>, that had been <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Mokkan (Confiscation).html">mokkan</a> ryo (confiscated lands) -- All of them were received as rewards in the Jisho no ran (Jisho civil war, 1180) in the process of establishing the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (military government of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a>). The former provinces were called Kanto gobunkoku (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>'s provincial jurisdiction) and the latter <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> were called Kanto goryo (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>'s private estates), both of which were also collectively called Heike <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Mokkan (Confiscation).html">mokkan</a> ryo (lands confiscated from the Heike). Here, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> dono (Lord of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a>), who was the head of the head family of the Kawachi Genji, had attained the position of one of the greatest <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> ryoshu of Japan in those days. To those shoryo, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Gokenin.html">gokenin</a> (personal retainers of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>) were appointed as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a> (protectors, or military governors) or jito (stewards), and a strong system of government was constructed based on their military forces. Even after the whole family line of the Kawachi Genji was destroyed, the position was taken over by the successive seii taishogun (barbarian-subduing generalissimo), which expanded its power by taking over the shoryo and various <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shiki (a rank in government offices under ritsuryo system).html">shiki</a> (the right to use land and to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Share.html">share</a> in the products of the land) which were confiscated in disturbances such as the Jokyu no ran (Jokyu disturbance; 1221) and in times of crisis and rebellion of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Gokenin.html">gokenin</a>. The shoryo of the other <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bushi.html">bushi</a> (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a>) also mainly originated in the various <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shiki (a rank in government offices under ritsuryo system).html">shiki</a> of their own <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> and koryo (public lands). Many of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Gokenin.html">gokenin</a> applied military and police powers, which they had obtained after becoming <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a> or jito of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>, on their own shoryo to remove various kinds of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shiki (a rank in government offices under ritsuryo system).html">shiki</a> associated with their own shoryo. The rule of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Gokenin.html">gokenin</a> remained subject to the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> koryosei system; therefore, although <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a>'s monopolistic control of the shoryo was liable to appear earlier in the local shoryo of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Gokenin.html">gokenin</a> than the shoryo of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>, which stated the policy of having <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Gokenin.html">gokenin</a> in harmony with the other powerful houses, influences of the court nobles, temples, and shrines, which occupied higher various <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shiki (a rank in government offices under ritsuryo system).html">shiki</a>, and the local <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kokuga (provincial government office compounds).html">kokuga</a> cannot be completely removed during this period. </p>
<p>On the other hand, the Ashikaga clan, which raised from a mere <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Gokenin.html">gokenin</a> to found the Muromachi <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>, gained the shoryo by depriving the enemies of the shoryo during the Nanbokucho civil war, but lost their shoryo when their shoryo was taken as rewards to the others or was deprived by the enemies -- Consequently, its <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Goryosho.html">goryosho</a> (shogunal domain) was far less than that of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>. Under the influences of the long-lasting civil war and hanzeirei (half-tax decrees), <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Jisha honjoryo (lands of temples and nobles).html">Jisha honjoryo</a> (lands of temples and nobles) and koryo were severely declined, and the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shiki (a rank in government offices under ritsuryo system).html">shiki</a> associated with the lands became in name only. As a result, each of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bushi.html">bushi</a> throughout Japan including <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> (great feudal lord) established an integral rule over his own shoryo, which influenced the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Goryosho.html">goryosho</a> of the Muromachi <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>. Here, 'bukeryo' had been established both in name and in reality. This trend spread throughout Japan as the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> ryogokusei system (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> control over provinces) was introduced, and observed through bakuhan taisei (power structure of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> domains) until hanseki <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Hokan (Professional entertainer).html">hokan</a> (surrender of the domain registers to the emperor) and chitsuroku shobun (abolish hereditary stipend) were carried out. </p>
