<p>The Jisho Sannen no Seihen was an incident where <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/TAIRA no Kiyomori.html">TAIRA no Kiyomori</a> led an army to conquer <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and stalled the government by Cloistered <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Goshirakawa.html">Emperor Goshirakawa</a> in December (November in old lunar calendar) 1179. It is also referred as the coup d'état of Jisho Sannen (Third Year of Jiho Era) (1179). </p>
<p>Progress<br/>
</p>
<p><h3>The Previous Night</h3>
</p>
<p>The relation between <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Goshirakawa.html">Emperor Goshirakawa</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/TAIRA no Kiyomori.html">TAIRA no Kiyomori</a> came into crisis due to the Shikagatani Incident in 1177, but Kiyomori limited the scale of the incident to the execution of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/FUJIWARA no Narichika.html">FUJIWARA no Narichika</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Saiko.html">Saiko</a>, who were the heads conspirators, and the exile of participants, and did not put the blame on the emperor at this time. The cloistered emperor tried to reconcile with Kiyomori on the surface, and the opposition between both parties seemed to soften. </p>
<p>Empress TAIRA no Tokuko gave birth to the imperial prince of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Takakura.html">Emperor Takakura</a> in December 1178 (November 1178 in old lunar calendar). Kiyomori demanded to make the imperial prince as the crown prince to the cloistered emperor, and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Shinno (Imperial Prince).html">Shinno</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Senji (imperial decree).html">senji</a> (a letter of the order of the emperor which demanded the inauguration of crown prince) was carried out to name the imperial prince as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Antoku.html">Emperor Antoku</a> (Tokihito) on January 14 (December 9 in old lunar calendar), and he was formally installed as the Crown Prince on January 20 (December 15 in old lunar calendar). The position of guardian and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Togu-No-Fu (an official in charge of education of the Crown Prince).html">togu-no-fu</a> (an official in charge of education of the Crown Prince) was assigned to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/FUJIWARA no Tsunemune.html">FUJIWARA no Tsunemune</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Sadaijin (Minister of the Left).html">Sadaijin</a> (Minister of the Left), and as the staff of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Togubo (Crown Princes Quarters).html">Togubo</a> (Crown Prince's Quarters) was assigned to TAIRA no Munamori, Togu no Daibu (a chief officer of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Togubo (Crown Princes Quarters).html">Togubo</a>), Kanemasa KASANNOIN, Gonno Taifu (vice chief officer), <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/TAIRA no Shigehira.html">TAIRA no Shigehira</a>, suke (an assistant secretary of an office), <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/TAIRA no Koremori.html">TAIRA no Koremori</a>, gon no suke (provisional assistant master), who were the Taira family and the court nobles close to the Taira clan. The close servants of cloistered emperor were removed from around the crown prince, and the cloistered emperor began to hold a disapproval and was wary of Taira Clan. <h3>Main factor</h3>
</p>
<p><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/TAIRA no Shigemori.html">TAIRA no Shigemori</a> retired from the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Naidaijin (inner minister).html">Naidaijin</a> (Minister of the Interior) due to the worsening of his illness in April (March in old lunar calendar). Shigemori asked for the life of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/FUJIWARA no Narichika.html">FUJIWARA no Narichika</a> to be spared but was not heard, and he lost interest in politics consequently dissapearing from the center stage of politics. TAIRA no Moriko, who was the daughter of Kiyomori, passed away on July 30 (June 17 in old lunar calendar). 
<br/>Moriko inherited most of the estate of Sekkan-ke (the families which produced regents) after the death of her husband, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/FUJIWARA no Motozane.html">FUJIWARA no Motozane</a>, and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Kanezane KUJO.html">Kanezane KUJO</a> mentioned in his diary, "<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Gyokuyo.html">Gyokuyo</a>," 'Since she forcefully took away the estate of Fujiwara clan despite being someone of an opposite gender, there was a divine punishment from Kasuga Daimyojin (the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> deity).'<br/>
The estate of Sekkan-ke managed by Moriko was thought to be handed over to FUJIWARA no Motomichi (the son of Motozane) or <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Takakura.html">Emperor Takakura</a> whose <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Junbo.html">junbo</a> (a woman who was given the status equivalent to the emperor's birth mother) was Moriko, but the cloistered emperor assigned Shirakawa-dono Kuraazukari (the finance of the palace of Emperor Shirawaka) to FUJIWARA no Kanemori, who was his trusted vassal, and confiscated all of the estate in reality. </p>
<p>Shigemori passed away on September 9 (July 29 in old lunar calendar), but <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/FUJIWARA no Sueyoshi.html">FUJIWARA no Sueyoshi</a>, who was the trusted vassal of the cloistered emperor, became Governor of Echizen Province in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Jimoku (ceremony for appointing officials).html">Jimoku</a> (ceremony for appointing officials) of November 16 (October 9 in old lunar calendar), and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Chigyo-koku.html">chigyo-koku</a> (provincial fiefdom) of Shigemori after 1166 was confiscated. In addition, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Moroie MATSUDONO.html">Moroie MATSUDONO</a>, who was the eight year old son of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Motofusa MATSUDONO.html">Motofusa MATSUDONO</a>, Kanpaku (chief adviser to the Emperor), became Gon <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Chunagon.html">Chunagon</a> (a provisional vice-councilor of state) in place of twenty years old Motomichi. Motofusa, whose Sekkan-ke estate was taken away in addition to being involved in the Denkanoriai Incident, became the foremost leader in the anti-Taira clan force. This staff reassignment was intended to destroy the reputation of Kiyomori, who made his own daughter, TAIRA no Hiroko, marry Motomichi and supported him. The anti-Taira clan forces gained enough power in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Enryaku-ji Temple.html">Enryaku-ji Temple</a>, which was close to the Taira clan, to cause civil war, causing events to become unpredictable. <h3>The Outbreak</h3>
</p>
<p>The day of Toyoakari-no-sechie (official imperial seasonal party) on December 21 (November 14 in old lunar calendar), 1179. Kiyomori lead an army of several thousand <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Cavalry.html">cavalry</a> and entered <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> from Fukuhara and into Hachijo-dono (Hachijo Palace). <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> was filled with military soldiers, and people rioted over the uncertain future. Motofusa and Moroie were dismissed from their posts on 22nd (15th in old lunar calendar), and Moromichi was appointed to be the Kanpaku, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Naidaijin (inner minister).html">Naidaijin</a>, and Uji no <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Choja.html">choja</a> (the head of the clan). The cloistered emperor was surprised by the firm attitude of Kiyomori, and used the Joken (the son of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shinzei.html">Shinzei</a>) as the messenger, and said that he would not interfere with political duties hence forwards, and it was interpreted that the dismissal of Kanpaku father and son from their posts made the cloistered emperor and Kiyomori reconcile temporarily. However, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Kakukai.html">Kakukai</a>, who was the head priest of the Tendai sect of Buddhism was dismissed from his post on 23rd (16th in old lunar calendar) and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Myoun.html">Myoun</a> of the pro-Taira clan party was reassigned, and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/FUJIWARA no Moronaga.html">FUJIWARA no Moronaga</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daijo-daijin (Grand minister of state).html">Daijo-daijin</a> (Grand minister of state), MINAMOTO no Suketaka, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Dainagon (chief councilor of state).html">Dainagon</a> (chief councilor of state), <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/FUJIWARA no Mitsuyoshi.html">FUJIWARA no Mitsuyoshi</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Sangi.html">Sangi</a> (councillor), FUJIWARA no Chikanobu, Dazai no daini (Senior Assistant Governor-General of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Dazai-fu (local government office in Kyushu region).html">Dazai-fu</a> offices), <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/FUJIWARA no Sueyoshi.html">FUJIWARA no Sueyoshi</a>, Governor of Echizen Province, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/TAKASHINA no Yasutsune.html">TAKASHINA no Yasutsune</a>, Okurakyo (Minister of the Treasury), <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/FUJIWARA no Norisue.html">FUJIWARA no Norisue</a>, Governor of Mutsu Province were dismissed from their court official posts on 24th (17th in old lunar calendar). Furthermore, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/TAIRA no Yorimori.html">TAIRA no Yorimori</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/TAIRA no Chikamune.html">TAIRA no Chikamune</a> of TAIRA clan, and also their relative, KASANNOIN Kanemasa were dismissed from their court posts of Uemon no Kami (the chief of a government office called "uemonfu"), Uchuben (dupty minister of department overseeing some major ministries), and Togu no Daibu. Up to thirty-nine people were dismissed from their office on this day (eight <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kugyo.html">Kugyo</a> (court nobles), Tenjobito (a courtier allowed to enter the Imperial Palace), <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Zuryo (The Head of The Provincial Governors).html">Zuryo</a> (the head of the provincial governors), thirty-one <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kebiishi (police and judicial chief).html">Kebiishi</a> (police and judicial chief)). There was a wide shift in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Zuryo (The Head of The Provincial Governors).html">zuryo</a> of each province, and chigyokoku of Taira clan increased to thirty-two from seventeen provinces prior to the coup d'état; 'Japan Akitsu-shima (literally, "Land of Dragonflies") has only sixty-six provinces, and Heike (Taira family) chigyokoku became thirty-something provinces, already half the size of a country' ("The Tale of the Heike"). </p>
<p>Motofusa was demoted to Dazai gon no sochi (Provisional Governor-General of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Dazai-fu (local government office in Kyushu region).html">Dazai-fu</a> offices) as exiled on 25th (18th in old lunar calendar), and it was decided that Moronaga and Sukekata would be exiled as well. These measures were revealed in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Jimoku (ceremony for appointing officials).html">Jimoku</a> and since the shosho or senmei (an imperial edict) which were the official commands of the emperor, were distributed, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Takakura.html">Emperor Takakura</a> was already under control of Kiyomori. The cloistered emperor was transferred to Toba Dono (Toba Detached Palace) under the command of Kiyomori on 27th (20th in old lunar calendar) (8 am). The Toba Dono was heavily guarded by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> such that only the sons of FUJIWARA no <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shinzei.html">Shinzei</a> (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/FUJIWARA no Shigenori.html">FUJIWARA no Shigenori</a>, FUJIWARA no Naganori, and Joken) and their wives were allowed to go in and out, and it was these conditions that were put to a stop by the government of Cloistered <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Goshirakawa.html">Emperor Goshirakawa</a>. Kiyomori left the latter responsibility to Munamori and left for <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Fukuhara-kyo (Capital of Fukuhara).html">Fukuhara-kyo</a>. The dismissal of close vassals of the cloistered emperor, the arrest and confiscation of estates started, and close vassals of cloistered emperor, Yasunari OE, who had the title of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kebiishi (police and judicial chief).html">Kebiishi</a>, lit his own palace on fire and committed suicide, FUJIWARA no Kanemori, who was the Shirakawa-dono kuraazukari, had his wrists cut off, and Tameyuki, who was the former governor of Bingo Province, and Tameyasu, who was the former governor of Kazusa Province, were assassinated and pushed into the ocean. The third crown prince of the Cloistered <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Goshirakawa.html">Emperor Goshirakawa</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Prince Mochihito.html">Prince Mochihito</a>, also faced his estate being confiscated, and this became a direct cause for the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Prince Mochihito.html">Prince Mochihito</a> to mobilize the army. </p>
<p>However, Kiyomori was also not planning the military dictatorship from the beginning, and he accepted the positions of the upper class <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kugyo.html">kugyo</a> such as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/FUJIWARA no Tsunemune.html">FUJIWARA no Tsunemune</a>, who had the title of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Sadaijin (Minister of the Left).html">Sadaijin</a>, Kanezane, who had the title of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Udaijin (Minister of the Right).html">Udaijin</a> (Minister of the Right), and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Sanesada TOKUDAIJI.html">Sanesada TOKUDAIJI</a>, who had the title of Sadaisho (Major Captain the Left Division of Inner Palace Guards) and sought cooperation. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Takakura.html">Emperor Takakura</a> passed his position over to Imperial Prince Tokihito (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Antoku.html">Emperor Antoku</a>) in March (February in old lunar calendar) 1180, and the government by the Cloistered <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Takakura.html">Emperor Takakura</a> started as a puppet of the Taira clan. <h3>Influence</h3>
</p>
<p>The act of grabbing hold of power by confining the cloistered emperor led to the birth of many opposition forces. Kofukuji-Temple, which opposed to the exile of Motofusa, Kanpaku, and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Onjo-ji Temple.html">Onjo-ji Temple</a> which had a close relationship with the cloistered emperor were representatives. There was a clash between the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kokushi.html">Kokushi</a> (provincial governors) and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> within provinces within newly born chigyokoku of Taira clan. Tsunehiro KAZUSA and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshiaki MIURA.html">Yoshiaki MIURA</a> of the powerful government officers of the alternated Kazusa and Sagami Provinces, were pressurized by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Mokudai.html">Mokudai</a> (deputy <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kokushi.html">kokushi</a>, or a deputy provincial governor) of Taira clan, and this became a trigger for them to greatly contribute to the mobilization of the army of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Yoritomo.html">MINAMOTO no Yoritomo</a>. The conflict which dissapeared from the central area worsened in local districts. <h3>The list of people who were dismissed from their positions (November 17)</h3>
</p>
<p>According to the entry written on December 24 (November 17 in old lunar calendar), 1179 in "<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Sankaiki.html">Sankaiki</a>" (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Tadachika NAKAYAMA.html">Tadachika NAKAYAMA</a>'s diary), the following thirty-nine people were dismissed from their positions in the emergency <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Jimoku (ceremony for appointing officials).html">Jimoku</a> (ceremony for appointing officials). </p>
