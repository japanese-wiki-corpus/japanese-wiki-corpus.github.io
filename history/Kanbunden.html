<h1>Kanbunden (漢文伝)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kanbunden is a style of biography written in classical Chinese, influenced by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kidentai (historiographical format).html">Kidentai</a> (an East Asian historical writing style) of Chinese authentic history and Kokushitai (Japanese historical writing style) of Japanese authentic history. </p>
<p>A Japanese authentic history, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Rikkokushi (the Six National Histories).html">Rikkokushi</a> (6 histories of the nation), basically maintains the appearance of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Hennentai (a descriptive method of history).html">Hennentai</a> (a chronological writing style) in classical Chinese, but in the 5 histories other than "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan).html">Nihonshoki</a>," the biographies of high officials or high-rank priests were added in the descriptions of their deaths (Kokushitai). In early times those descriptions were only about their achievements, but later various episodes were also added. By the influence of those histories of Japan and series of biographies of major Chinese history books such as "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shiki (a rank in government offices under ritsuryo system).html">Shiki</a>," biographies used to be written for rewarding individuals. </p>
<p>In the Nara period, the biography of the FUJIWARA three generations began with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Kamatari.html">FUJIWARA no Kamatari</a>, "Kaden" (Family history) and "Shotokutaishi Denryaku" (Biography of Shotokutaishi) were written, and in the Heian period <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/MIYAKO no Yoshika.html">MIYAKO no Yoshika</a> (the compiler of an authentic history "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Nihon Montoku Tenno Jitsuroku (Veritable Records of Emperor Montoku of Japan).html">Nihon Montoku Tenno Jitsuroku</a>" [Fifth of the six official national history books]) wrote "Dojo Hoshi Den" (Biography of Dojohoshi), <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kiyoyuki MIYOSHI.html">Kiyoyuki MIYOSHI</a> wrote "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Yasunori.html">FUJIWARA no Yasunori</a> den" (Biography of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Yasunori.html">FUJIWARA no Yasunori</a>) and "Enchin Osho Den" (Biography of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Enchin.html">Enchin</a>), and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/KI no Haseo.html">KI no Haseo</a> wrote "Tsunesada Shinno Den" (Biography of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Imperial Prince Tsunesada.html">Imperial Prince Tsunesada</a>). Also, more creativity-conscious books than historical facts, such as "Zoku Urashima Den" (Sequel of the folklore, Taro Urashima [Rip van Winkle]) of unknown authorship, appeared, which influenced the subsequent narrative literature. </p>
