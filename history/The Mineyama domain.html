<h1>The Mineyama domain (峰山藩)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The Mineyama domain was a domain existing in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Tango (the Boys Festival).html">Tango</a> province. It was a small but historic domain inherited as part of the territory under <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Tango (the Boys Festival).html">Tango</a> province, originally given to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Takatomo KYOGOKU.html">Takatomo KYOGOKU</a>, a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> (Japanese territorial lord) during the Sengoku period, because of distinguished war service during the Battle of Sekigahara. </p>
<p>The first lord <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Takamichi KYOGOKU (lord of the domain of Mineyama, Tango-no-kuni).html">Takamichi KYOGOKU</a> (lord of the Mineyama domain of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Tango (the Boys Festival).html">Tango</a> province) was born as the second son of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Nobutsuna KUTSUKI.html">Nobutsuna KUTSUKI</a> and was adopted by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Takatomo KYOGOKU.html">Takatomo KYOGOKU</a>. Takatomo KYOGOKU, the lord of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Tango (the Boys Festival).html">Tango</a> province, divided <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Tango (the Boys Festival).html">Tango</a> into three and each of his three children inherited one of them and Takamichi, 10,000 goku (approximately 1.8 million liters in crop yield) in the Mineyama region. This made Takamichi lord of 13,000 goku together with 3,000 goku already given by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Hidetada TOKUGAWA.html">Hidetada TOKUGAWA</a> (the second <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Edo bakufu.html">Edo bakufu</a>, the Japanese feudal government), then he established a jin-ya (regional government office) in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyotango City.html">Kyotango City</a> of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Tango (the Boys Festival).html">Tango</a> province and founded a new domain. </p>
<p>Soon <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kaieki.html">kaieki</a> (change of rank) was made to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/family/the Kyogoku clan.html">the Kyogoku clan</a>, the head family in the Miyazu domain, and the Kyogoku family in the Tanabe (Maizuru) domain of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Tango (the Boys Festival).html">Tango</a> province was also transferred to the Toyooka domain of Tajima province, and thereby only this 13,000 goku in the Mineyama domain remained in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Tango (the Boys Festival).html">Tango</a> among the territories of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Takatomo KYOGOKU.html">Takatomo KYOGOKU</a> who possessed the entire <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Tango (the Boys Festival).html">Tango</a> province. </p>
<p>The sixth lord <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Takahisa KYOGOKU.html">Takahisa KYOGOKU</a> became <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Wakadoshiyori.html">wakadoshiyori</a> (a managerial position in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Edo bakufu.html">Edo bakufu</a>). Takahisa is famous as a character that appeared in "Onihei Hankacho" (Onihei's crimes note), who understands Nobutame HASEGAWA quite well, known as Onihei. </p>
