<h1>Gakumongenryu (The Origin of Learning) (学問源流)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>"Gakumongenryu" is a history book of the study of Chinese classics written by Shiso NABA (Rodo NABA, NABA is also pronounced NAWA) in the middle of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Edo Period.html">Edo Period</a>. It is a one-volume book. </p>
<p>In 1789, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Shiso (Perilla).html">Shiso</a>, who realized his days were numbered, made his pupil write at his dictation, after his death, his own younger brother Mototsugu OKUDA (Shosai OKUDA) found the manuscript while he was arranging the articles left by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Shiso (Perilla).html">Shiso</a>, and talked with the heir of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Shiso (Perilla).html">Shiso</a>, then published it in 1794. </p>
<p>On the whole, the book defends <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shushigaku (Neo-Confucianism).html">Shushigaku</a> (Sogaku: Neo- Confucianism founded on the doctrines of ZHU Xi) and sticks to the view of history to consider <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shushigaku (Neo-Confucianism).html">Shushigaku</a> to be supreme. He writes that Confucianism had been overwhelmed by Buddhism since the Engi and Tenryaku Period and it changed into the learning of Zen monks, that <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Seika FUJIWARA.html">Seika FUJIWARA</a> began the serious study of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shushigaku (Neo-Confucianism).html">Shushigaku</a>, and that later <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Jinsai ITO.html">Jinsai ITO</a> and his son <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Togai ITO.html">Togai ITO</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Ansai YAMAZAKI.html">Ansai YAMAZAKI</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Toju NAKAE.html">Toju NAKAE</a>, and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Sorai OGYU.html">Sorai OGYU</a> tried to criticize <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shushigaku (Neo-Confucianism).html">Shushigaku</a> for meiri (fame and profit), insisting on different theories from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shushigaku (Neo-Confucianism).html">Shushigaku</a> such as Yomeigaku (Neo-Confucianism based on teaching of WANG Yangming) and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kobunjigaku (the study of archaic words and phrases).html">Kobunjigaku</a> (study of ancient rhetoric school), and finally he stresses that <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shushigaku (Neo-Confucianism).html">Shushigaku</a> is the right and completed Confucianism from which meiri was eliminated. It also deals with the history of prose and poetry in China. </p>
<p>It was published several times through the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Edo Period.html">Edo Period</a> because of the demand to defend <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shushigaku (Neo-Confucianism).html">Shushigaku</a> at that time and its clear writing, after the Meiji Period, it was also published with movable type system by Hakubunkan (a publisher). </p>
