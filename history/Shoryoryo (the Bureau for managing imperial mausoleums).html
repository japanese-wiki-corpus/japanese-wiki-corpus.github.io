<h1>Shoryoryo (the Bureau for managing imperial mausoleums) (諸陵寮)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The Shoryoryo was an organization which belonged to Jibu-sho Ministry (the Ministry of Civil Administration) under the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ritsuryo.html">Ritsuryo</a> system (a system of centralized government based on the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ritsuryo.html">ritsuryo</a> code). </p>
<p><h3>Official duties and History</h3>
</p>
<p>Shoryoryo was established as Shoryo-shi (Office of Mausoleums) under the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ritsuryo.html">Ritsuryo</a> system. It was promoted to a bureau (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ritsuryo.html">Ritsuryo</a> system) in 729. Official duties of the Shoryoryo/Shoryo-shi included management of imperial mausoleums, mourning and funeral rites for the imperial family. For the management of imperial mausoleums in particular, the bureau kept a name list of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Ryoko.html">Ryoko</a> (imperial tomb guard) and made them guard the mausoleums. When misfortunes took place, they were regarded as a curse of the dead, and officers of Ryo were sent to the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Mausoleum.html">mausoleum</a> of the unfortunate imperial family and consoled the spirit. The case of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Imperial Prince Sawara (Sawara Shinno).html">Imperial Prince Sawara</a> is famous. Imperial mausoleums are now kept by the Imperial Household Archives. </p>
