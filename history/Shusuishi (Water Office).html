<h1>Shusuishi (Water Office) (主水司)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Shusuishi (moitori no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Tsukasa (a rank in government offices).html">tsukasa</a>) was one of the institutions belonging to Kunaisho (Ministry of the Sovereign's Household) in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ritsuryo.html">Ritsuryo</a> system (a system of centralized government based on the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ritsuryo.html">ritsuryo</a> code). </p>
<p><h3>Official duties</h3>
</p>
<p>Shusuishi delivered water and ice, and made rice gruel. Especially ice was much-prized as a rarity in summer. For delivery Moitoribe was put as Kanjin Zonin (lower-ranking government official) and Moitoriko as Zoshiki (low-level functionary government official). And for transportation, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Kanjin.html">kanjin</a> shicho (a manservant doing odd jobs) belonged to this. Kushicho (general workers) was put in the field department of heavy labor and seems to have struggled very hard to transport ice. After medieval times the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/family/Kiyohara clan.html">Kiyohara clan</a> took a position of Kami (director) by succession and succeeded to attached land of Shusuishi. <h3><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Himuro.html">Himuro</a> (ice chamber)</h3>
</p>
<p>Ice was produced in winter and thus, for keeping it until summer, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Himuro.html">himuro</a> was built up. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Himuro.html">Himuro</a> were put around Kinai region (provinces surrounding <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and Nara) and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Azukari (official post).html">azukari</a> (an additional post to the chief of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Naizenshi (Imperial Table Office).html">Naizenshi</a>) was put in each <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Himuro.html">himuro</a>. <h3>Personnel</h3>
</p>
<p>Kami (corresponding to Jurokui [Junior Sixth Rank]) one member. Jo (secretary) (corresponding to Shohachiinoge [Senior Eighth Rank, Lower Grade]) one member. Reishi (corresponding to Shohatsuinoge [Lesser Initial Rank, Lower Grade]) one member. Kanjin Zonin, newly established. Shibu (low rank bureaucrats).
