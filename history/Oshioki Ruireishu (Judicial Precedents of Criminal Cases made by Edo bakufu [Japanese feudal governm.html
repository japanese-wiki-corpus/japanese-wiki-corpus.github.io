<h1>Oshioki Ruireishu (Judicial Precedents of Criminal Cases made by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Edo bakufu.html">Edo bakufu</a> [Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>]) (御仕置例類集)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Oshioki Ruireishu was a compilation of law reports dealing with criminal cases, which was created by the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Edo bakufu.html">Edo bakufu</a>. It was the documents by classifying and sorting Hyogisho, the reports of the criminal cases which each <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Bugyo.html">bugyo</a> (magistrate) had asked the roju (senior councilor of the Tokugawa shogunate) to consult <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Hyojosho (conference chamber).html">Hyojosho</a> (conference chamber), by the case of crime, and the status, age, and gender of criminal, and so on. </p>
<p>The following five editions were confirmed by the year of the compilation. 
<br/>Koruishu (Old collection of the cases; 30 volumes)<br/>
Cases from 1771 to 1802; completed in 1804<br/>
Zokuruishu (Collection of the cases, continued; 31 volumes)<br/>
Cases from 1803 to 1814<br/>
Shinruishu (New collection of the cases; 37 volumes)<br/>
Cases from 1815 to 1826<br/>
Tenporuishu (Collections of the cases in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Tenpo.html">Tenpo</a> era [1830 to 1843]; 65 volumes)<br/>
Cases from 1827 to 1839<br/>
Shinshinruishu (Newer collection of the cases; 79 volumes)<br/>
Cases from 1840 to 1853<br/>
They were distinguished by the color of the cover. There were limitations on cases or punishment that <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Bugyo.html">bugyo</a> or <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daikan (local governor).html">daikan</a> (local governor) could handle on their own authority, and they asked for the roju's judgment for cases that they were unable to handle. The roju consulted <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Hyojosho (conference chamber).html">Hyojosho</a> about such cases. "Oshioki Ruireishu" was a compilation of the Hyogisho (reports) created by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Hyojosho (conference chamber).html">Hyojosho</a> in this regard. It annotated records of cases which were deliberated several times and minority opinions, and since it touched on the legal interpretations of Kujigata Osadamegaki (the law of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Edo bakufu.html">Edo bakufu</a>), it was treated, together with the Osadamegaki, as highly confidential information which only the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Machi-bugyo (town magistrate).html">machi-bugyo</a> (town magistrate), <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Kanjo.html">kanjo</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Bugyo.html">bugyo</a> (the commissioner of finance), <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Jisha (Buddhist Temples and Shinto Shrines).html">jisha</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Bugyo.html">bugyo</a> (the magistrate of temples and shrines), <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shoshidai.html">shoshidai</a> (the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> deputy), and Keeper of Osaka Castle were allowed to store. </p>
<p>It is thought that the only existing book of Shinshinruishu, which was owned by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Hyojosho (conference chamber).html">Hyojosho</a>, was burned in the Great Kanto Earthquake. However, the other four editions, which were handed down from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Jisha (Buddhist Temples and Shinto Shrines).html">Jisha</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Bugyo.html">bugyo</a> to the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> government at the time of the overthrow of the Edo shogunate, are in the posession of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/National Diet Library (NDL).html">National Diet Library</a>. </p>
