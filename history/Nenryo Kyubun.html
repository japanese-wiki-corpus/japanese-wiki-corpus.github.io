<h1>Nenryo Kyubun (年料給分)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Nenryo kyubun is one of the horoku (stipend, pay, salary) systems in the Heian period. It is called Nenkyu for short. The system consists of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Nenkan.html">nenkan</a> (a right granted as a stipend to members of the Imperial family (including the emperor), consorts of the emperor, some Court nobles, and so forth to nominate a person for a certain government post conferred to them on the occasion of the annual installation of them as government officials) and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Nenshaku.html">nenshaku</a> (a right granted as a stipend to a retired emperor, the mother of the Emperor Dowager, the Empress Dowager, the Empress, and so forth to nominate a person for a certain rank conferred to them on the occasion of the annual conferment of a rank to them). At annual <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Jimoku (ceremony for appointing officials).html">Jimoku</a> (ceremony for appointing officials) persons with the rights were entitled to recommend people of their choices for Ikai (Court rank) and specific government posts which were given to influential temples and shrines as well as ingu (ex-emperor, ex-emperor who became a monk, imperial lady, grand empress dowager, empress dowager, empress consorts and crown prince). </p>
<p>As the owners of the territories, ingu, temple and shrines were allowed to publicly seek applicants for joi (investiture of a Court rank) or specific government posts every year and grant official ranks in return for Joshaku (conferring of a Court rank) fee and ninryo (fee for getting an official rank). </p>
