<h1>Sogishi (喪儀司)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Sogishi (Mourning and Burial Office) is a bureau within Jibusho (Ministry of Civil Administration) under the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ritsuryo.html">ritsuryo</a> system (a system of centralized government based on the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ritsuryo.html">ritsuryo</a> code). </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>Sogishi was responsible for management of general funerals and funeral equipments. Imperial tombs and funeral music were under the jurisdiction of Shoryoshi (Mausolea Office) (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shoryoryo (the Bureau for managing imperial mausoleums).html">Shoryoryo</a> [Bureau of Mausolea]) and Kosuishi (Drums and Fifes Office) respectively, and there was significant crossover between work of Sogishi and that of them, so sogishi was absorbed into Kosuishi in 808. After absorption, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shoryoryo (the Bureau for managing imperial mausoleums).html">Shoryoryo</a> came to manage funerals and Sogishi was responsible only for management of the equipments. <h3>Personnel</h3>
