<h1>Shoto (所当)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Shoto was the tax levied on paddy fields and dry fields in the Medieval period. It was treated as a pair with kuji (pubic duties), and seen generally to be the same as nengu (land tax), but they were originally different. </p>
<p>The word originally meant 'corresponding to,' or 'correct,' and this meaning had been used in general for a long time. Shoto,' which meant tax, originally indicated taxes properly levied such as kanmotsu (produce tax), zoyaku (miscellaneous labor services), and jishi (land tax); but from the beginning of the 12th century, 'shoto' solely meant a regular levy (in contrast to such extraordinary levies as kuji and extraordinary odd-jobs). In the Kamakura period, the word meant a regular levy on paddy fields and dry fields, and began to be interchanged with 'nengu' which originally had a similar meaning. </p>
