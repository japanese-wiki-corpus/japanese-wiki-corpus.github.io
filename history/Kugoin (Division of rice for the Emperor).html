<h1>Kugoin (Division of rice for the Emperor) (供御院)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kugoin (Division of rice for the Emperor) refers to an auxiliary organization of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Oiryo.html">Oiryo</a> (Bureau of Palace Kitchens under the Ministry of the Imperial Household). </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>It is said that collected Miine (rice for the Emperor) which was cultivated at <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kanden (imperial estates).html">Kanden</a> (imperial estates) in the Kinai region (provinces surrounding <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and Nara) was allocated to Hanryo (food expense) of the Emperor, Empress and Crown Prince ("<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Saikyuki.html">Saikyuki</a>" (exemplary book on Heian rituals)). When Miineta (field for cultivation of rice for the Emperor) directly controlled by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Oiryo.html">Oiryo</a> was formed later, Miine cultivated at Miineta was collected. </p>
<p>Although Shisho (people who performed miscellaneous duties about documents) of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Oiryo.html">Oiryo</a> was appointed to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Azukari (official post).html">Azukari</a> (an additional post to the chief of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Naizenshi (Imperial Table Office).html">Naizenshi</a>) of Kugoin, but after Hironobu ISOBE was appointed to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Azukari (official post).html">Azukari</a> in 1002, the Isobe clan inherited a post of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Azukari (official post).html">Azukari</a> and the right to control Miineta for 15 generations equivalent to about 300 years. Since the Nakahara clan also came to inherit Oi no kami, Chief of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Oiryo.html">Oiryo</a> holding juristiction over Kugoin, in the same manner, it was structured to appoint the Isobe clan as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Azukari (official post).html">Azukari</a> based on the recommendation ('Ryokeninpu' (document of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Appointment (Ninkan).html">appointment</a> by a chief of bureau) for the Isobe clan, and 'Ryokegyojo' (document of recommendation by a chief of bureau) for the imperial court) by Oi no kami assumed by the Nakahara clan. However, it is said that all disputes which frequently arose between the Nakahara clan and the Isobe clan over the right to control Miineta ended up being won by the Isobe clan ("Rinjisho" (a book describing the Emperor's command)). </p>
