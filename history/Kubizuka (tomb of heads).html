<h1>Kubizuka (tomb of heads) (首塚)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kubizuka (tomb of heads) is a tomb for the repose of those souls whose heads (kubi; literally means neck in Japanese) were severed because they were killed in battles and the likes, or captured, or punished by beheadings. </p>
<p>In Japan war performances were verified by identifying the heads of those killed in the battle; in order to console those heads, many Kubizuka were built. </p>
<p>There are Kubizuka enshrining a single person (like an enemy <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> commander) who was feared to become <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Onryo (Revengeful Ghost).html">Onryo</a> (a vengeful ghost) later, and also there are Kubizuka enshrining many solders killed in one battle (in a huge battle like the Battle of Sekigahara) together even though they were zohyo (common soldiers); a great number of both types of Kubizuka still exist throughout Japan. </p>
