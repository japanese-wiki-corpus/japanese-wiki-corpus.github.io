<h1>Shugoshi funyu (守護使不入)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Shugoshi funyu means that in the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period and the Muromachi period, the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>) forbade <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a> (provincial constables) and their officials from entering some specific koryo (public lands), <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> (manors), and so on, which were specified by the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>, when pursuing criminals and collecting taxes. Shugoshi funyu is also referred to as <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a> funyu. </p>
<p>During the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Sengoku Period (period of warring states) (Japan).html">Sengoku Period</a> (Period of Warring States), this privilege which had been granted by the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> was denied and instead <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> (Japanese territorial lords) in the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Sengoku Period (period of warring states) (Japan).html">Sengoku Period</a> came to give it to their <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a> and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Kokushu.html">kokushu</a> (landed <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a>) as part of their rights. </p>
<p><h3><a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a></h3>
</p>
<p>Originally not only a <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a> but also his officials and emissaries acting as his agents had been empowered to enter domestic koryo and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> to perform their duties of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Taibon Sankajo.html">Taibon Sankajo</a> (three major tasks of peacekeeping), but the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> agreed to provide special areas in which a <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Kokushi.html">kokushi</a> (regional lord), <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Ryoke.html">ryoke</a> (lord of the manor), <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Honjo (proprietor or guarantor of manor).html">honjo</a> (proprietor or guarantor of manor), or kenmon (an influential family) were not interfered with by <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a>, in order to avoid a confrontation with them. This agreement was further clarified by the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Goseibai-shikimoku (code of conduct for samurai).html">Goseibai-shikimoku</a> (code of conduct for <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a>), and then a principle was established that even when a criminal and others ran into such funyuchi (special areas for excluding <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a>), the criminal should be searched by <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Kokushi.html">kokushi</a> or <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Ryoke.html">ryoke</a>, and handed over to the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a> side on a border line of the funyuchi. <h3>Muromachi <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a></h3>
</p>
<p>In the Muromachi <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>, extensive rights were given to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a> (or <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a> <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a>, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a> that became <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a>, which were Japanese feudal lords), such as Karita Rozeki Kendan (the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a>'s right to suppress provincial warriors who entered <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> unlawfully to harvest rice, and to prosecute and convict them), Shisetsu Jungyo Ken (a right empowered to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a> to implement shisetsu jungyo, in which <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a> who received orders from the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> sent jungyo-shi, emissaries, to a region and have them execute the orders) and Tansen Choshu Ken (a right to collect surtax), in addition to the existing <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Taibon Sankajo.html">Taibon Sankajo</a>, but <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Gokenin.html">gokenin</a> (an immediate vasal of the shogunate in the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> and Muromachi through Edo periods) who had been granted the shugoshi-funyu privilege backed by the authority of the Ashikaga family positioned to accede to the shogunate, refused collection of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Tansen.html">tansen</a> (surtax) from <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a>, and responded to one from the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> as direct payment to the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (known as kyono) was approved, which enabled them to escape from a danger of being surcharged by the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a>. </p>
<p>Although this could have apparently produced a chigaihoken (extraterritoriality) area in the domains of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a> <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> and seems to have caused an obstacle in ruling systems of the Muromachi <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>, in fact, contrary to that, by tightening of the shugo-ryogoku system (the system that a <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a> dominates a manor), it prevented <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a> <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> from executing ryogoku ichien shihai (ruling the whole region of the territory) and suppressed expansion of his power, and at the same time, the privileged <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Gokenin.html">gokenin</a> class tried to maintain this privilege by increasing dependence on the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> powers, which helped the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> form support for political, economic, and military bases to confront the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a> <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a>. <h3>The <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Sengoku Period (period of warring states) (Japan).html">Sengoku Period</a></h3>
</p>
<p>After the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Sengoku Period (period of warring states) (Japan).html">Sengoku Period</a>, however, the authority of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> declined and Sengoku <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> (Japanese territorial lord in the Sengoku period) who formed their own territories by winning <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Gekokujo.html">gekokujo</a> (an inverted social order when the lowly reigned over the elite) without dependence on the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>'s power not only began to deny the privilege but also came to grant or despoil it as their own rights. Also, some of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a> daimyos who had observed the shugoshi funyu rules released by the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> came to take measures to deny in public such shugoshi-funyu privilege granted by the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>, on the pretext of maintaining their territories. </p>
<p>In 1498, for example, Fusayoshi UESUGI, the Governor of Echigo Province, declared that he would not approve to claim shugoshi funyu within Echigo Province, and during the Eisho era (1504-1521) <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Ujichika IMAGAWA.html">Ujichika IMAGAWA</a>, the Governor of Suruga Province, expelled the Shiba clan, the Governor of Totomi Province, without permission of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>, ruled the province, and conducted a land survey even in the territories specified as shugoshi funyuchi. Thereafter, his son <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Yoshimoto IMAGAWA.html">Yoshimoto IMAGAWA</a> completely denied the shugoshi funyuchi specified by the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> authority in his <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Bunkokuho.html">bunkokuho</a> (the law individual sengoku-daimyo enforced in their own domain) 'Imagawa Kana Mokuroku Tsuika' (expanding on house rules left by Ujichika), published in 1552, on the ground that those who maintain order in the present Imagawa territory are not the Ashikaga <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> family, but the Imagawa clan itself. This was also clear declaration by the Imagawa clan that he was no longer the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a> <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> who ruled his territory backed by the authority of the Muromachi <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>, but the Sengoku <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> who ruled his own territory with his own capability. </p>
