<h1>Iden (fields given according to the court rank) (位田)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Iden refers to the rice fields which were given to the ones higher than goi (Fifth Rank) in the rank and the imperial family, depending on the rank or honi (court rank) in the ritsuryo system (a system of centralized government based on the ritsuryo code) in Japan. It was regarded as Yusoden (rice field subject to taxation) which was obliged to pay tax of Soyocho (a tax system, corvee). And the rice fields which were provided depending on honi were also called honden (a rice field that was given based on one's official rank). </p>
<p>Kanjin-eigyo-den (hereditary field of officials) system in Tang Ritsuryo Code was modified to be suitable for the situation in Japan and was applied to the Japanese ritsuryo system. Kanjin-eigyo-den in Tang Dynasty could be succeeded to offspring for generations, but differently, iden in Japan were officially confiscated after ones' death. </p>
<p>The method of choice of iden, the actual cultivators of iden and so on have not been clarified yet. Some think that the location name of 'iden,' which have been remained in various regions, is the ishochi of iden. </p>
