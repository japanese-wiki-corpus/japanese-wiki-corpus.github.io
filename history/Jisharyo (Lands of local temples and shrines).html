<h1>Jisharyo (Lands of local temples and shrines) (寺社領)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Jisharyo was a classification of fief that once existed in Japan. </p>
<p>Summary<br/>
The Jisharyo mainly meant shoryo (individual holding) settled for maintaining and operating temples and shrines. </p>
<p>In ancient times, in addition to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shinden.html">shinden</a> (also referred to as kanda; land held by a shrine) and jiden (also referred to as terada; land held by a temple), fuko (households of temples and shrines) granted by the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ritsuryo.html">Ritsuryo</a> state (state based on <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ritsuryo.html">ritsuryo</a> code in the seventh century) and the early time <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> (estate) which was established by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Konden (New rice field).html">konden</a> (development of fallow land or creation of new rice paddies) were the main source of income for the temples and shrines (Some big temples and shrines had systems such as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Zojishi (Officials in Charge of Building Temples).html">zojishi</a> (officials responsible for building temples, and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shingun.html">shingun</a> - also referred to as kamikoori; deity district). As the statutory <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ritsuryo.html">ritsuryo</a> system became slack, fuko and the early <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> systems were only in name. Replacing the systems, after the mid Heian period, the government dispatched <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Azukari (official post).html">azukari</a> dokoro (estate custodian) to the local estates based on <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> that consisted of donated lands that had been granted <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Fuyu no ken (Japan).html">Fuyu no ken</a> (the right of tax exemption) or the like as a business foundation, and also appointed the local magnate or influential farmer to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shokan.html">shokan</a> (estate officer) or <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Myoshu.html">myoshu</a> (local landowner and cultivator) to oppose the rule of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kokuga (provincial government office compounds).html">kokuga</a> (provincial government office). </p>
<p>The state of rule differed between the temple and shrine -- In the temples, the right of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> ryoshu (estate proprietor) was not divided into multiple positions in a system and the estate was put under centralized control, or alternatively, the right was divided between the main temple and inge (temple next in rank of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Monzeki (Monseki).html">monzeki</a> that had imperial connections), that belonged to the main temple, to prevent an invasion from outside; but in fourteenth century, as the temples were exposed to invasions of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bushi.html">bushi</a>, the temples enhanced its direct rule in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> near the precinct of the temple to secure its <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kajishi.html">kajishi</a> (additional tax). On the other hand, in the shrines, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shake.html">shake</a> (hereditary priest at a shrine) divided and ruled the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> to secure stable income, but gradually privatized the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> as its own karei (hereditary land), even sold the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> to the others in some cases. Then, the government issued various <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Jisha (Buddhist Temples and Shinto Shrines).html">jisha</a> kogyoho (Shrine restoration policy) to prevent an invasion from outside the religious institution and embezzlement from inside the religious institution, but was little effective. </p>
<p>When the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> system collapsed in the disturbances during the Nanbokucho period (North and South Dynasties period) and the Sengoku period (Warring states period), many of the jisharyo were lost -- In the Toyotomi administration, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kenchi.html">kenchi</a> (cadastral surveys) was strengthened, whereby merely a part of shuinchi (estates of temple and shrine confirmed by the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> and exempted from tax) was protected under the bakuhan system (power structure of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> domains). </p>
<p>Under the land reform accompanying the chisokaisei (revision of land-tax) during the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period, the Jisharyo was broken up. </p>
