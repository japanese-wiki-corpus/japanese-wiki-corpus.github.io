<h1>Karyaku no Sodo (a rebellion in the Karyaku era) (嘉暦の騒動)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>"Karyaku no sodo" (Karyaku rebellion) refers to a conflict in 1326, towards the end of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period, between Nagasaki Takasuke, a minister to the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/family/Tokuso.html">Tokuso</a> family and the Adachi clan, whose head was a maternal relative of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/family/Tokuso.html">Tokuso</a> family over inheriting the head post of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/family/Tokuso.html">Tokuso</a> family within the Hojo clan, which was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Regent.html">regent</a> to the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> shogunate. </p>
<p>On April 24, 1326, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Takatoki HOJO.html">Takatoki HOJO</a>, the 14th <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shikken (regent for the shogun).html">shikken</a> (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Regent.html">regent</a> to the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>) became a priest due to illness at the age of 24. Nagasaki Takasuke, uchikanrei (head of Tokuso Family) recommended Kunitoki HOJO, Takatoki's eldest son born in December the previous year and whose mother was Troika no Mae, a sister of Muneshige GODAIIN, who was also a retainer of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/family/Tokuso.html">Tokuso</a> family as the next head of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/family/Tokuso.html">Tokuso</a> family, and he also recommended <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Sadaaki HOJO.html">Sadaaki HOJO</a>, head of the branch Hojo clan as a temporary 15th <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shikken (regent for the shogun).html">shikken</a> (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Regent.html">regent</a> to the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>) until Kunitoki became able to inherit the regency. With his aunt having married Godaiin, Sadaaki was a relative of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/family/Tokuso.html">Tokuso</a> family. As Takatoki became a priest, on five occasions Sadaaki also asked if he could become one, but was persuaded not to do so by Nagasaki. </p>
<p>Takatoki's legal wife was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Tokiaki ADACHI.html">Tokiaki ADACHI</a>'s daughter, and Adachi, being a maternal relative of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/family/Tokuso.html">Tokuso</a> family, showed displeasure even at the birth of Kunitoki (whose mother was a retainer of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/family/Tokuso.html">Tokuso</a> family), and neither <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kakukai Enjo.html">Kakukai Enjo</a>, Takatoki's mother, nor anybody from the Adachi clan made an appearance either at the birth or in front of Takatoki. To prevent Kunitoki from inheriting the head post of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/family/Tokuso.html">Tokuso</a> family, the Adachi clan recommended <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/family/Yasuie HOJO.html">Yasuie HOJO</a>, Takatoki's younger brother and son of Okatadono (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kakukai Enjo.html">Kakukai Enjo</a>), as the successor to Takatoki. </p>
<p>On the morning of April 27, a messenger of Nagasaki visited Sadaaki to announce that he had been appointed to the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shikken (regent for the shogun).html">Shikken</a> post. Sadaaki, pleased by the news, duly attended Hyojo (conferences in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>). However, on the same day, Yasuie became a priest saying that such a situation was a disgrace for him. Many people did the same thing as Yasuie, showing that a lot of people were dissatisfied with the decision to appoint Sadaaki to the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shikken (regent for the shogun).html">Shikken</a> post. It was rumored that an angry Yasuie and Okata (his mother) contemplated an attempt on Sadaaki's life, and forced into a corner, Sadaaki resigned his position as the 15th <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Regent.html">regent</a> to the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> on May 7, to become a priest. His regency lasted for little more than 10 days. </p>
<p>While no person in the HOJO clan wanted to take up the regency, fearing the wrath of Yasuie and the Adachi clan, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Moritoki HOJO.html">Moritoki HOJO</a>, the chief of Hikitsukeshu (coadjustors of the high court), was at last appointed to the post on June 3, becoming the last <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shikken (regent for the shogun).html">Shikken</a> of the HOJO clan. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Koresada HOJO.html">Koresada HOJO</a> was appointed rensho (assistant to regents). It was decided that Shikken Moritoki should help Kunitoki, Takatoki's legitimate son, and in accordance with the precedent, Kunitoki paid a visit to Hachiman-gu Shrine when he was five to be inaugurated head of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/family/Tokuso.html">Tokuso</a> family. The successor to the position of head of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/family/Tokuso.html">Tokuso</a> family became a relative of a retainer of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/family/Tokuso.html">Tokuso</a> family, creating the situation wherein the Hojo clan became engulfed by retainers of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/family/Tokuso.html">Tokuso</a> family. </p>
<p>Around the same time, in the Imperial court in Heian-kyo Capital as well, the struggle between <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Daikakuji-to.html">Daikakuji-to</a> (imperial lineage starting with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Kameyama.html">Emperor Kameyama</a>) and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Jimyoin-to.html">Jimyoin-to</a> (imperial lineage starting with Emperor Fukakusa) to succeed the emperor had become serious. Therefore, the internal strife in the Hojo clan made the political situation increasingly confusing, leading to the demise of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> in June, 1333. </p>
