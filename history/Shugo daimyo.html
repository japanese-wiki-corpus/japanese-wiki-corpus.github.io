<p>The <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> is a concept in Japanese history that refers to the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a> of the Muromachi period, who acquired not only the function of the military and law enforcement but also the economic power, and strengthened the territorial, pervasive control over a province. 
<br/>The provincial system governed by the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> is called the 'shugo-ryogoku system.'<br/>
From the period of the late fifteenth to early sixteenth century, some <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> became Sengoku <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> (daimyo of the Sengoku, or 'Warring States' period) while other <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> declined. </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>The power of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a> during the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period was prescribed by the legal code for the warrior class: their power was limited to the military and law enforcement, such as the 'Taibon-sankajo no <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kendan-sata (criminal cases).html">kendan-sata</a>' (three official authorities given to the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a> over criminal cases: the prodding of lower-ranking vassals to fulfill their duties as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Obanyaku.html">obanyaku</a>, i.e., security guards, in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a>, the search and arrest of rebels and murderers) and the direction and supervision of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Obanyaku.html">obanyaku</a>; the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a> was prohibited from participating in the administration of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kokuga (provincial government office compounds).html">kokuga</a> and the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kokuga (provincial government office compounds).html">kokuga</a>'s province, which the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kokushi.html">kokushi</a> was authorized to perform. </p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a> system of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> shogunate was inherited when the Muromachi shogunate was established. Initially, the power of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a> was limited to the taibon-sankajo-no-kendan, just as it was in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period, but in 1346 the Muromachi shogunate gave the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a> the authority to judge the case of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Karita-rozeki.html">karita-rozeki</a> and the authority of the shisetsu-jungyo to administer the country more stably. The <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Karita-rozeki.html">karita-rozeki</a>, an act of harvesting rice in the paddy field in order to claim the ownership of the land, occurred with the conflicts of land appropriation among <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a>. The shisetsu-jungyo was intended to enforce the shogunate's decision in the field. As a result of obtaining the right of judgment over criminal cases, the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a> now had two rights: the right to intervene in the dispute between <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> in the province and the right to enforce the law. Moreover, originally the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a> were often selected from the powerful samurais in the local area, but the change was gradually made to select from the descents of the Ashikaga <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> family, the Fudai (hereditary vassals) or the meritorious retainer. </p>
<p>In 1352, the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a> were given the right of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Hanzei (Half Payment of Taxes).html">hanzei</a> to collect half the customs from the manor and the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kokuga (provincial government office compounds).html">Kokuga</a>'s territory within the province, in order to secure military provisions for the Kanno-no-Joran (turmoil of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kanno.html">Kanno</a>). Initially, the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Hanzei (Half Payment of Taxes).html">hanzei</a> was granted only in the three provinces where fierce battles had raged (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Omi Province.html">Omi Province</a>, Mino Province, and Owari Provice), but the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a> competed to demand the granting of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Hanzei (Half Payment of Taxes).html">hanzei</a>, and the right was gradually perpetuated, spreading throughout the land. The <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Hanzei (Half Payment of Taxes).html">hanzei</a> decree of the Oan era issued in 1368 authorized the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a> to take not only half the customs, which had already been granted, but also half the land, and subsequently the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a> penetrated deep into the manor and the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kokuga (provincial government office compounds).html">Kokuga</a>'s territory. Moreover, the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a> signed, together with the manor lords, a contract to manage the payment of customs, and served as the shugo-uke, who had substantially greater control over the manor. With this shugo-uke, the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a> obtained the right to govern the land itself, i.e., the shitaji-shinshi-ken (the right to appropriate the land). </p>
<p>Additionally, the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a> were granted the right to collect the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Tansen.html">tansen</a>, a tax imposed in proportion to the area by the Imperial Court or the shogunate for the contingent project (for example, building the palace) and to collect the munebetsu-sen, a tax imposed on each house. With this right to collect tax, the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a> continued to strengthen the economic power by independently imposing and collecting the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Tansen.html">tansen</a> and munebetsu-sen. </p>
<p>Because of the enhanced powers as described above, the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a> took over the organization governed by the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kokushi.html">kokushi</a> and recruited the zaicho-kannin (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kokuga (provincial government office compounds).html">kokuga</a>'s officer) in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kokuga (provincial government office compounds).html">kokuga</a> as a vassal while at the same time combining the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kokuga (provincial government office compounds).html">kokuga</a>'s province with the zaicho-kannin's territory to form the shugo-ryo (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a>'s province) directly governed by the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a>. </p>
<p>In parallel with these processes, the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a>, with their strong economy, recruited as vassals even influential figures called <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kokujin.html">kokujin</a>, such as the jito (estate steward) and the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Myoshu.html">myoshu</a> (owner of the paddy field) in the province, in addition to the zaicho-kannin mentioned above. This entire process is called 'hikanka' (被官化), and with it the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a> increased their equal, territorial influence (pervasive control) over the province. </p>
<p>These functions of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a> during the Muromachi period were considerably different from those of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period, which were limited to the military and law enforcement; accordingly, the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a> of the Muromachi period is called the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a>, being distinguished from the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a> of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period. Additionally, the provincial system governed by the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> is called the shugo-ryogoku system. The provincial control by the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a>, however, was not as complete as the one in the Sengoku-ryogoku system during the later period: in fact, there are many examples in which the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kokujin.html">Kokujin</a> refused to serve as a vassal of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a>, particularly in the Kinai. Moreover, the shogunate did not think it was appropriate to dismantle the manorial system or strengthen the power of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a>, and this often disturbed powerful <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> despite the opposition of the Imperial Court, temples and shrines. </p>
<p>By the middle of the Muromachi period the system of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> in the shogunate was enlarged, and it was possible to describe the Muromachi shogunate as a so-called coalition government of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a>. Powerful <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> in those days included the tozama-seiryoku (forces of outside lords) such as the Yamana, Ouchi and Akamatsu clans, as well as the clans of the Ashikaga <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> family such as the Shiba, Hatakeyama and Hosokawa clans. These powerful <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a> often resided in the capital for some duration in order to serve the shogunate, and for that reason they appointed the shugo-dai (deputy <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a>) from the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kokujin.html">kokujin</a> and the direct vassals as deputies of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a> when they left the province or had many provinces. Even the shugo-dai placed the ko-shugo-dai (deputy of the shugo-dai), creating a structure of governance having two or three layers. </p>
<p>Since approximately the time of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Onin War.html">Onin War</a> (Onin-no-ran), conflicts between <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> increased to a striking degree. Concurrently with the increased conflicts, the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kokujin.html">Kokujin</a>'s aspirations for independence, as in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kokujin.html">kokujin</a> uprising (kokujin-ikki), became more apparent. On one hand, these movements undermined the authority of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a>, but on the other hand they tightened the control of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kokujin.html">kokujin</a> by the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a>. Starting around the Meio-no-seihen (明応の政変) in 1493, the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> that had failed to regain authority were ousted from their positions by shugo-dai and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kokujin.html">kokujin</a>, while those that succeeded in tightening the control of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kokujin.html">kokujin</a> further strengthened the provincial control. </p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a> in the Muromachi period that had succeeded in strengthening the control of the province, as well as the shugo-dai and the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kokujin.html">kokujin</a> that had overthrown the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a>, gradually evolved into the Sengoku <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a>. The Sengoku period is said to have been the era of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Gekokujo.html">Gekokujo</a>, in which the inferiors overthrew their superiors, but in fact a considerable number of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> managed to become Sengoku <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a>. The only families that survived to remain as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> in the modern period were as follows: the Uesugi, the Kyogoku, the Hosokawa-oshu, the Izumi-Hosokawa, the Ogasawara, the Shimazu, the Satake and the Soke. </p>
