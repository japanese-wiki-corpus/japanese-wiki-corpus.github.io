<h1>Shugai Sanjurokkasen (集外三十六歌仙)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Shugai Sanjurokkasen is a collection of poems by 36 poets from the Muromachi period to the early Edo period following the example of Sanjurokkasen (36 Master Poets). Shugai' means that they were not included in Nijuichidai-shu (the 21 collections of waka poems compiled by imperial command). It is said to have been personally selected by Emperor Gomizunoo. </p>
<p>The collection is characterized by the fact that many of the poets included are not court noble poets, but warrior-poets and renga-shi (linked verse poets). </p>
<p>The Himeji City Museum of Art houses an album by Hoitsu SAKAI depicting scenes from Shugai Sanjurokkasen. </p>
