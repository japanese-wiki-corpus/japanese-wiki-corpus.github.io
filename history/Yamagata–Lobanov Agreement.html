<h1>Yamagata–Lobanov Agreement (山縣・ロバノフ協定)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The Yamagata-Lobanov Agreement was the agreement signed on June 9, 1896 between the empires of Japan and Russia on disputes over their sphere of influence over Korea. </p>
<p>The unstable political situation in Korea due to the power struggle between the pro-Japanese and Russian factions in the Joseon dynasty was endangering the interests of both Japanese and Russian sides. The agreement was signed in Saint Petersburg by the ex-prime minister of Japan, Aritomo YAMAGATA, and the Russian foreign minister, Prince Alexey Lobanov-Rostovsky. It was the neutral agreement that both Japan and Russian would guarantee the independence of Korean, promote fiscal reform in Korea, assemble a modern police and army, and maintain telegraph lines. </p>
<p>The Yamagata-Lobanov Agreement was superseded by the Nishi-Rosen Agreement of 1898. </p>
