<h1>Heike no <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Ochudo.html">Ochudo</a> (fugitives from the Genpei War) (平家の落人)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The term Heike no <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Ochudo.html">Ochudo</a> means fugitives who retreated to remote regions after their defeat in the Jisho-Juei War (the Genpei War). This term principally refers to the family and retainers, as well as followers of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Ise-Heishi (Taira clan).html">Ise-Heishi</a> (Taira clan). Although the term Heike no <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Ochimusha.html">Ochimusha</a> (surviving <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a>) is sometimes used, Heike no <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Ochudo.html">Ochudo</a> is commonly used since not only <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> but also court nobles, women and children were among the fugitives. The oral tradition saying that Heike no <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Ochudo.html">Ochudo</a> retreated to specific regions is commonly called the Heike no <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Ochudo.html">Ochudo</a> legend. Though 132 villages throughout the nation insist that their residents are the descendants of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Ochudo.html">Ochudo</a>, almost all of their arguments are considered to be incredible. </p>
<p><h3>Brief explanation on Heike no <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Ochudo.html">Ochudo</a></h3>
</p>
<p>The legend of Heike no <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Ochudo.html">Ochudo</a> has been passed down in many places in Japan. In the first place, Heike no <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Ochudo.html">Ochudo</a> were fugitives of the Taira family side who were repeatedly defeated in the Battle of Ichi no tani, the Battle of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Yashima (Noh play).html">Yashima</a> and the Battle of Dan no ura during the Genpei War in which <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Seiwa-Genji (Minamoto clan).html">Seiwa-Genji</a> (Minamoto clan) and the Taira family fought a decisive battle. As the remnants of the Taira family who escaped from pursuers hid themselves in many places as <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Ochudo.html">Ochudo</a>, various oral traditions were born and have been passed down. So far as <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> are concerned, these fugitives are sometimes called Heike no <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Ochimusha.html">Ochimusha</a>. However, Heike no <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Ochudo.html">Ochudo</a> is more commonly used since people other than <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> also escaped and hid themselves. Places where Heike no <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Ochudo.html">Ochudo</a> hid themselves are called Heike-dani (villages of Heike fugitives), Heikezuka (burial mound of Heike fugitives), Heike no kakurezato (villages where Heike fugitives hid themselves) or Heike no <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Ochudo.html">Ochudo</a> no sato (villages where Heike fugitives settled down). </p>
<p>A common misunderstanding regarding the Heike no <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Ochudo.html">Ochudo</a> legend is the confusion of the descendants of Heike no <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Ochudo.html">Ochudo</a> with those of the Taira family. Although there exist quite a lot of oral traditions saying that members of the Taira family escaped to the place concerned, the notion of Heike no <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Ochudo.html">Ochudo</a> stands for "people who sided with the Taira family and thereafter escaped to a certain place." Therefore, it shouldn't be forgotten that <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> who sided with the Taira family were included, other than the members of Taira family, in Heike no <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Ochudo.html">Ochudo</a>. </p>
<p>Further, since the nature of the Genpei War was the feud between <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Ise-Heishi (Taira clan).html">Ise-Heishi</a> and Bando-Heishi, which sided with the Genji clan, Heike no <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Ochudo.html">Ochudo</a> cannot be identified with the Taira clan. </p>
<p>There exist some oral traditions that were fabricated, dressed-up, or have been passed down mistakenly. However, given the fact that a war usually creates many fugitives, it is natural to consider that many people of the Taira family became fugitives since the Taira family was defeated and collapsed though it held sway over the western part of Japan and held a large army. </p>
<p>Further, as a result of marriage of the descendants of Heike no <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Ochudo.html">Ochudo</a>, indirect descendants increased accordingly and such indirect descendants were sometimes called Heike no <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Ochudo.html">Ochudo</a> as well. Though the above practice is not necessarily wrong, it sometimes gave rise to cases where oral traditions of Heike no <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Ochudo.html">Ochudo</a> were mistakenly understood since they have been passed down orally. Furthermore, it sometimes led to the fabrication of oral traditions, caused cases where some oral traditions were judged to be fabricated because of exaggeration or extended interpretation arising from petty mistakes and/or made oral traditions themselves ambiguous. </p>
<p>At any rate, there is no doubt that there were a considerable number of Heike no <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Ochudo.html">Ochudo</a>. This fact is proved by Mikka Heishi no ran (Three days rebellion of the Taira clan), which was initiated by the remnants of the Taira family, and the rebellion initiated by Suketomo JO, who sided with the Taira family. Therefore, there are many Heike no <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Ochudo.html">Ochudo</a> legends that are credible. </p>
<p>In view of the situation where <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Ochudo.html">Ochudo</a> managed to survive by hiding themselves, however, it can be easily imagined that their history was supposed to be kept secret. In this sense, setting aside the question of the degree of credibility or the existence of facts, there are few legends that can be verified objectively from the historical viewpoint. Also, attention should be paid to the fact that in the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Edo Period.html">Edo Period</a>, people who were engaged in the profession called keizushiri made their living by visiting villages and drawing for local residents genealogical tables showing that they came from a distinguished historical family. </p>
<p>Setting aside the question of correctness or historical verification, it is true that there exist surnames associated with Heike no <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Ochudo.html">Ochudo</a> legends throughout Japan, and such oral traditions filled with mystery and darkness stir people's imagination for history. <h3>Heike no kakurezato</h3>
</p>
<p>Most kakurezato where Heike no <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Ochudo.html">Ochudo</a> settled are located deep in the mountains, on solitary islands or on remote islands. The Taira family constructed villages in inaccessible areas such as sparsely populated areas, mountain areas or ravines. </p>
<p>The existence of kakurezato was accidentally noticed by outside people when the residents dropped tableware or other household utensils in the river while washing or in the mountains. However, only a handful of people noticed the existence of kakurezato or could go there. Even in such cases, however, outside people couldn't find kakurezato again, or saw lacquer ware come floating down from upstream and as a result, they sometimes came to think of kakurezato as something like a specter. </p>
<p>Under such circumstances, Heike no kakurezato were often conceived of as mysterious entities called "kakurezato." <h3>Surnames associated with Heike no <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Ochudo.html">Ochudo</a></h3>

</p>
<p>Kobuyashiki, Daigo-machi, Kuji County, Ibaraki Prefecture<br/>
</p>
<p>It has been passed down that the remnants of Kagechika OBA, who sided with the Taira family, escaped to this place. It is also said that the remnants were not <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> but the daughters of a military commander who attended the Taira family side, and their descendants constructed ten houses at Kobuyashiki. The surnames of two daughters and their descendants who settled here were Kirihara and Kaminaga. It is said that the Kirihara clan descended from the Oba clan, which descended from the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> clan, one of Bando Hachi Heishi (the Eight Taira clans of the East), and the Kaminaga clan descended from the Fujiwara clan.

<p>Katashina-mura, Tone County, Gunma Prefecture<br/>
In the Kanto region, this is the northernmost village where an oral tradition of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Ochudo.html">Ochudo</a> has been passed down. After being defeated at various places, the Taira family escaped to Katashina-mura, which is located near Oze and surrounded by steep mountains, and Heike no <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Ochudo.html">Ochudo</a> settled there and prospered. </p>
<p>Kawamata, Kuriyama-mura, Shioya County, Tochigi Prefecture (present Nikko City)<br/>
</p>
<p>It is believed that TAIRA no Fujifusa (also called FUJIWARA no Fujifusa) escaped to this place, and historical spots like Taisho-zuka (burial mounds of the general) and Heike-sugi (cedar trees related to the Taira clan) are still found here and there. </p>
<p>Yunishikawa, Nikko City, Tochigi Prefecture (Yunishikawa Onsen)<br/>
</p>
<p>It is believed that TAIRA no Tadazane escaped to this place. There are unique customs, such as not hoisting Koinobori (carp streamers) on the day of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Tango (the Boys Festival).html">Tango</a> no <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Sekku (Seasonal Festival Days).html">Sekku</a> (Children's Day). A Heike no <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Ochudo.html">Ochudo</a> legend in Yunishikawa is on display at Heike Ochudo Folk Museum and events such as the Heike Taisai Festival are also held here. Yunishikawa Onsen is actively making use of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Ochudo.html">Ochudo</a> legend for tourism. </p>
<p>It is believed that legitimate relatives of the Taira family escaped to this place and used the surname "Ban" to conceal the fact that they were the relatives of the Taira clan. </p>
<p>Even at present, the descendants of the Taira family with the surname Ban reside in this village. </p>
<p>The left-hand side of the Chinese character "伴" represents a person, and this Chinese character becomes "伻" (Hei) if the right-hand side is slightly modified. In other words, "伻" means persons of Taira and/or the relatives of the Taira family. </p>
<p>Unique customs that are existent in the village are not hoisting koinobori, not making bonfires (so as not to produce smoke), not keeping dogs and not to raising chickens. These customs originated out of the need to conceal from outsiders that people were living in the mountain. <h3>Chubu and Hokuriku region</h3>

<p>NASU no Munehisa (known as "Daihachi" or "Daihachiro" and believed to be a younger brother of Nasu no Yoichi), a resident of Shimotsuke Province and a member of the Nasu clan, joined the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> army organized for hunting down the remnants of the Taira family and suppressed the remnants who took position at Mukoyama situated on the border of Higo Province. Thereafter, he went to Mt. Shiiba in Hyuga Province in order to hunt down the remnants who took position there, but he eventually stopped hunting when he saw that they had no intention to fight and were striving at farm work. At Shiiba-mura, Munehisa became acquainted with Tsurutomi-hime, who was believed to be the youngest grandchild of Taira no Kiyomori, fell in love with her and was blessed with two children while he was staying there for three years. When Nasu no Munehisa returned to his homeland, the remnants of the Taira family changed their surname from Taira to Nasu out of gratitude for Munehisa, who saved their lives by stopping his hunt. The song which was created based on the above anecdote is "Hietsukibushi," the most famous folk song in Miyazaki Prefecture. </p>
