<h1>Heike no Ochudo (fugitives from the Genpei War) (平家の落人)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The term Heike no Ochudo means fugitives who retreated to remote regions after their defeat in the Jisho-Juei War (the Genpei War). This term principally refers to the family and retainers, as well as followers of Ise-Heishi (Taira clan). Although the term Heike no Ochimusha (surviving samurai) is sometimes used, Heike no Ochudo is commonly used since not only samurai but also court nobles, women and children were among the fugitives. The oral tradition saying that Heike no Ochudo retreated to specific regions is commonly called the Heike no Ochudo legend. Though 132 villages throughout the nation insist that their residents are the descendants of Ochudo, almost all of their arguments are considered to be incredible. </p>
<p><h3>Brief explanation on Heike no Ochudo</h3>
</p>
<p>The legend of Heike no Ochudo has been passed down in many places in Japan. In the first place, Heike no Ochudo were fugitives of the Taira family side who were repeatedly defeated in the Battle of Ichi no tani, the Battle of Yashima and the Battle of Dan no ura during the Genpei War in which Seiwa-Genji (Minamoto clan) and the Taira family fought a decisive battle. As the remnants of the Taira family who escaped from pursuers hid themselves in many places as Ochudo, various oral traditions were born and have been passed down. So far as samurai are concerned, these fugitives are sometimes called Heike no Ochimusha. However, Heike no Ochudo is more commonly used since people other than samurai also escaped and hid themselves. Places where Heike no Ochudo hid themselves are called Heike-dani (villages of Heike fugitives), Heikezuka (burial mound of Heike fugitives), Heike no kakurezato (villages where Heike fugitives hid themselves) or Heike no Ochudo no sato (villages where Heike fugitives settled down). </p>
<p>A common misunderstanding regarding the Heike no Ochudo legend is the confusion of the descendants of Heike no Ochudo with those of the Taira family. Although there exist quite a lot of oral traditions saying that members of the Taira family escaped to the place concerned, the notion of Heike no Ochudo stands for "people who sided with the Taira family and thereafter escaped to a certain place." Therefore, it shouldn't be forgotten that samurai who sided with the Taira family were included, other than the members of Taira family, in Heike no Ochudo. </p>
<p>Further, since the nature of the Genpei War was the feud between Ise-Heishi and Bando-Heishi, which sided with the Genji clan, Heike no Ochudo cannot be identified with the Taira clan. </p>
<p>There exist some oral traditions that were fabricated, dressed-up, or have been passed down mistakenly. However, given the fact that a war usually creates many fugitives, it is natural to consider that many people of the Taira family became fugitives since the Taira family was defeated and collapsed though it held sway over the western part of Japan and held a large army. </p>
<p>Further, as a result of marriage of the descendants of Heike no Ochudo, indirect descendants increased accordingly and such indirect descendants were sometimes called Heike no Ochudo as well. Though the above practice is not necessarily wrong, it sometimes gave rise to cases where oral traditions of Heike no Ochudo were mistakenly understood since they have been passed down orally. Furthermore, it sometimes led to the fabrication of oral traditions, caused cases where some oral traditions were judged to be fabricated because of exaggeration or extended interpretation arising from petty mistakes and/or made oral traditions themselves ambiguous. </p>
<p>At any rate, there is no doubt that there were a considerable number of Heike no Ochudo. This fact is proved by Mikka Heishi no ran (Three days rebellion of the Taira clan), which was initiated by the remnants of the Taira family, and the rebellion initiated by Suketomo JO, who sided with the Taira family. Therefore, there are many Heike no Ochudo legends that are credible. </p>
<p>In view of the situation where Ochudo managed to survive by hiding themselves, however, it can be easily imagined that their history was supposed to be kept secret. In this sense, setting aside the question of the degree of credibility or the existence of facts, there are few legends that can be verified objectively from the historical viewpoint. Also, attention should be paid to the fact that in the Edo Period, people who were engaged in the profession called keizushiri made their living by visiting villages and drawing for local residents genealogical tables showing that they came from a distinguished historical family. </p>
<p>Setting aside the question of correctness or historical verification, it is true that there exist surnames associated with Heike no Ochudo legends throughout Japan, and such oral traditions filled with mystery and darkness stir people's imagination for history. <h3>Heike no kakurezato</h3>
</p>
<p>Most kakurezato where Heike no Ochudo settled are located deep in the mountains, on solitary islands or on remote islands. The Taira family constructed villages in inaccessible areas such as sparsely populated areas, mountain areas or ravines. </p>
<p>The existence of kakurezato was accidentally noticed by outside people when the residents dropped tableware or other household utensils in the river while washing or in the mountains. However, only a handful of people noticed the existence of kakurezato or could go there. Even in such cases, however, outside people couldn't find kakurezato again, or saw lacquer ware come floating down from upstream and as a result, they sometimes came to think of kakurezato as something like a specter. </p>
<p>Under such circumstances, Heike no kakurezato were often conceived of as mysterious entities called "kakurezato." <h3>Surnames associated with Heike no Ochudo</h3>
