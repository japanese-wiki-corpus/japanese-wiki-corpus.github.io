<h1>Machi-koji Street (町小路)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Machi-koji Street was a street that was central to the townspeople of Kyoto in the middle ages, and was lined with doso (underground warehouses). </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>The predecessor of machikoji were the Machijiri-koji Street of Heian-kyo and became Shinmachi-dori Street from the Edo period. Geologically, it was a first-rate location in Kyoto at that time because it was on high grounds that would not be affected by the flooding of the Kamo-gawa River (Yodo-gawa River system). The merchant houses and factories of the craftspeople lined the street, whereas the courtiers and military families had homes east of the Higashinotoin-dori Street, which was more prone to flooding. The wealthier townspeople were called 'Utokunin' and paid for the Yamahoko Junko (procession of Gion Festival Floats) during the Gion-e (service for souls of Gion) instead of the government and were called 'Junya no Senmin' (people of the lower class who are wealthy). <h3>Towns along the street</h3>
</p>
<p>Following the notation method of 'East-West street and South-North street' (example: Shijo Karasuma) used even today that began with the establishment of Heian-kyo, the location where a Machi-koji Street bisects a East-West street was called 'XX-cho (town).'<br/>
