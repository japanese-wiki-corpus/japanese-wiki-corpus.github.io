<h1>Machi-koji Street (町小路)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Machi-koji Street was a street that was central to the townspeople of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> in the middle ages, and was lined with doso (underground warehouses). </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>The predecessor of machikoji were the Machijiri-koji Street of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Heian-kyo.html">Heian-kyo</a> and became <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Shinmachi-dori Street.html">Shinmachi-dori Street</a> from the Edo period. Geologically, it was a first-rate location in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> at that time because it was on high grounds that would not be affected by the flooding of the Kamo-gawa River (Yodo-gawa River system). The merchant houses and factories of the craftspeople lined the street, whereas the courtiers and military families had homes east of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Higashinotoin-dori Street.html">Higashinotoin-dori Street</a>, which was more prone to flooding. The wealthier townspeople were called 'Utokunin' and paid for the Yamahoko Junko (procession of Gion Festival Floats) during the Gion-e (service for souls of Gion) instead of the government and were called 'Junya no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Senmin (humble or lowly people).html">Senmin</a>' (people of the lower class who are wealthy). <h3>Towns along the street</h3>
