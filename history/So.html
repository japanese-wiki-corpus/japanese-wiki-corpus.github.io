<h1>So (ç§Ÿ)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>So as well as Zei are the goods and services that the government collect to ensure public finance for the nation. According to Setsumon-kaiji (Shuowen Jiezi) (Explaining Simple and Analyzing Compound Characters), So is defined as "Tax levied on rice crops," which was originally Denso, and was collected nominally for ritual expenses. </p>
<p>So is what is newly collected (Flow), and saved So (Stock) is Zei. Refer to Sozei. </p>
<p>Under the Ritsuryo system (a system of centralized government based on the ritsuryo code), Denso was collected as So. Under So-Yo-Cho (the tax system), only So had the aspect of land tax. </p>
