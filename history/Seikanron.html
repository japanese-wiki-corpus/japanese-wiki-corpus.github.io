<h1>Seikanron (征韓論)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Seikanron is the insistence of the members of the "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Rusu-seifu (government while heads of government are away).html">Rusu-seifu</a>" on making Korea open to the world by military power (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Rusu-seifu (government while heads of government are away).html">Rusu-seifu</a> means the government while heads of government are away: the heads of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Rusu-seifu (government while heads of government are away).html">Rusu-seifu</a> were <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Takamori SAIGO.html">Takamori SAIGO</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Taisuke ITAGAKI.html">Taisuke ITAGAKI</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Shinpei ETO.html">Shinpei ETO</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Shojiro GOTO.html">Shojiro GOTO</a>, and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Taneomi SOEJIMA.html">Taneomi SOEJIMA</a>). However, it is said that the insistence of Saigo, who was the central figure of Seikanron, was not on dispatching military but on his himself going there as a Japanese official diplomatic delegation and on asking Korea to open its country to the world (this insistence is called 'Kenkanron' [the insistence on sending delegations to Korea). </p>
<p>They insisted on sending military to Korea on ground that some scholars of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Kokugaku.html">Kokugaku</a> (the study of Japanese classical literature) and Mito-gaku (the scholarship and academic traditions that arose in the Mito Domain), and Shoin YOSHIDA said that ancient Japan had hegemony over Korean peninsula according to "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kojiki (The Records of Ancient Matters).html">Kojiki</a>" (The Record of Ancient Matters) and "Nihon-shoki" (Chronicles of Japan). In addition, this idea was brought into the political insistence of the Sonno-joi movement (the movement advocating reverence for an emperor and the expulsion of foreigners). </p>
<p>After the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Meiji Restoration (Meiji-ishin).html">Meiji Restoration</a>, the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> government noticed Korea to establish a new government and negotiated to have diplomatic relations, but Korea rejected them because the format of diplomatic papers was different from the one of Edo period. In Korea, the King's father Daewongun governed the country instead of the King at that time, adopting the policy of national isolation and expulsion of foreigners, and Korean people was in high spirits. In March 1870, the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> government sent Hakubo SATA and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Shigeru MORIYAMA.html">Shigeru MORIYAMA</a> to Korea, but SATA petitioned the government to conquer Korea by military force because he resented the attitude of Korea. In September, the government sent Gaimu-shojo (Junior Secretary of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs) Koki YOSHIOKA to Busan, and in February 1872, they appointed Yoshiakira SO as Gaimu-taijo (Senior Secretary of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs), and then, they sent Gaimu-taijo <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshimoto HANABUSA.html">Yoshimoto HANABUSA</a> to Korea in September. The movement of anti-Japanese became more active in 1873 instead of accepting the delegates from Japan, and then Korean officials led a boycott of Japanese goods and people in April and May. Therefore, the dispute of Seikanron became heated in Japan. </p>
<p>In June 1873, the problem of diplomacy with Korea was highlighted at the cabinet meeting again after <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Shigeru MORIYAMA.html">Shigeru MORIYAMA</a> was back to Japan. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Sangi.html">Sangi</a> (the Councilor) <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Taisuke ITAGAKI.html">Taisuke ITAGAKI</a> insisted that Japan dispatch the military for protecting Japanese residents in Korea, whereas <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Takamori SAIGO.html">Takamori SAIGO</a> opposed to send the military and insisted that he himself go to Korea as an ambassador. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Shojiro GOTO.html">Shojiro GOTO</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Shinpei ETO.html">Shinpei ETO</a> agreed with SAIGO. The <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> government once decided to send <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Takamori SAIGO.html">Takamori SAIGO</a> as an ambassador to Korea in August 1873, but <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Toshimichi OKUBO.html">Toshimichi OKUBO</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Tomomi IWAKURA.html">Tomomi IWAKURA</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Takayoshi KIDO.html">Takayoshi KIDO</a> and other members of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Iwakura Mission.html">Iwakura Mission</a> who returned Japan in September 1873 opposed it because it was too early in their opinion, and the government finally decided to suspend to send Saigo to Korea. The Grand Minister SANJO fell ill because the situation became uncontrollable to him. In consequence, Saigo, Itagaki and others who supported Seikanron went into opposition (this incident is called the "Seikanron Coup" or the "Coup of 1873"), and they became leaders of the revolt by Shizoku (family or person with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> ancestors) from Saga War in 1874 to Satsuma Rebellion or the Freedom and People's Right Movement. </p>
