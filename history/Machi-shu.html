<h1>Machi-shu (町衆)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Machi-shu (also known as Cho-shu) was a class consisting of wealthy commercial and industrial men, including doso (pawnbrokers and moneylenders), in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> from the Muromachi period to the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Sengoku Period (period of warring states) (Japan).html">Sengoku Period</a> (Period of Warring States) in Japan. This class played an important role in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> reconstruction after the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Onin War.html">Onin War</a>. Emphasizing autonomy and unity, it developed its unique culture. Their main religion was Hoke-kyo Sutra (the Lotus Sutra). <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Honno-ji Temple.html">Honno-ji Temple</a> was the head temple. </p>
<p>Representing a concept that inherited Kyowarabe (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>'s young people) and the like in the Heian period, Machi-shu was to be evolved into <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Chonin (Townspeople).html">Chonin</a> (townspeople) in the early-modern and Edo periods. </p>
<p>Although it is mostly read 'Machi-shu' today, it was apparently read 'Cho-shu' according to the historical materials in that period including "Setsuyo-shu" (a book on oriental medicine written by Waichi SUGIYAMA in the 1610s) and "Nippojisho" (Japanese-Portuguese dictionary, published 1603-1604). </p>
