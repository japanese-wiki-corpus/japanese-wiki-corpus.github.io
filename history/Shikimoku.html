<p></p>
<p>Shikimoku was an itemized form of law code used in medieval Japan. It was used mainly in the context of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bukeho.html">Bukeho</a> (the law system for the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> society and the military government). </p>
<p>The term '<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shiki (a rank in government offices under ritsuryo system).html">shiki</a>' of the Shikimoku has means <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shiki (a rank in government offices under ritsuryo system).html">shiki</a> of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Kyakushiki.html">Kyakushiki</a> code (amendments and enforcement regulations of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Ritsuryo.html">ritsuryo</a> law), while it is allegedly derived from shikijo (code), a form of court noble law which was established to complement <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Engishiki.html">Engishiki</a> (an ancient book for codes and procedures on national rites and prayers) that was the last and comprehensive <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shiki (a rank in government offices under ritsuryo system).html">shiki</a> compiled in the Imperial court. The term 'moku' means <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Mokuroku.html">mokuroku</a> (list) and jomoku (article). </p>
<p>The well-known shikimoku were <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Goseibai-shikimoku (code of conduct for samurai).html">Goseibai-shikimoku</a> or Joe-shikimoku (code of conduct for <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a>) compiled by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yasutoki HOJO.html">Yasutoki HOJO</a>, the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Regent.html">regent</a> of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>), and Kenmu Code compiled by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Tadayoshi ASHIKAGA.html">Tadayoshi ASHIKAGA</a> as an administrative policy of the Muromachi <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>. 
<br/>Sometimes tsuika ho (additional laws applied after the main code was already established) for the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Goseibai-shikimoku (code of conduct for samurai).html">Goseibai-shikimoku</a> was also referred as 'shikimoku.'<br/>
Thus the shikimoku, and the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Goseibai-shikimoku (code of conduct for samurai).html">Goseibai-shikimoku</a> in particular, were considered as fundamental laws for <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> government, and a view that the shikimoku was equal to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bukeho.html">Bukeho</a> was generally accepted. </p>
<p>From the historical <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Point (Sentoki).html">point</a> of view, however, the shikimoku meant the compilation of shikijo (code), a court noble law. It became evident that provisions for the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Goseibai-shikimoku (code of conduct for samurai).html">Goseibai-shikimoku</a> was in accordance with the law formula for the court noble law of the early <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period, which had changed corresponding to the social reality, actually by adding to a new system and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Myobo kanmon.html">Myobo kanmon</a> (written reports to the Imperial Court by scholars of the law). That was because the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Goseibai-shikimoku (code of conduct for samurai).html">Goseibai-shikimoku</a> was not directed to the general law in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> society, but it was also intended to evade legal conflicts between the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> and court noble society. According to 'Yasutoki shosokubun' (a letter of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yasutoki HOJO.html">Yasutoki HOJO</a>), since the court noble law had been described in Chinese classics and is difficult to be understood, a law written in a style easily understood by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> was made, meaning that the court noble law was reconstructed and altered to be more understandable for the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a>. In shikimoku the section of so-called 'reason in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> society' regarding incomes from land taxes on shoryo (territory), <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Nenkiho (a legal principle for the statute of limitations).html">Nenkiho</a> (a legal principle for the statute of limitations on land in possession) and so force were clearly described, while only indirectly mentioned in the form of proviso, details, and article of exceptions. That was supposedly because, as Yasutoki mentioned in the 'shosokubun,' he never meant to create a new legal system but contemplated a legal order based on the court noble law and harmony in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> society, therefore the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Goseibai-shikimoku (code of conduct for samurai).html">Goseibai-shikimoku</a> were the regulations and notes required to achieve this goal. </p>
<p>It has been believed that the reason why Yasutoki studied "Hososhiyo-sho" (a legal book compiled by the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/family/Sakanoue clan.html">Sakanoue clan</a> between the end of Heian period and the early <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period) as well as the criterion of Myobodo (study of Codes) (legal documents of petition, petition for objection, and so forth) and why his uncle <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Tokifusa HOJO.html">Tokifusa HOJO</a>, a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> rensho (assistant to regents in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>) who had worked as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Rokuhara Tandai (an administrative and judicial agency in Rokuhara, Kyoto).html">Rokuhara Tandai</a> (an administrative and judicial agency in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Rokuhara.html">Rokuhara</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>) with him and person who had come from lower-ranking government official in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and their descendents participated in the compilation were that he sought the source of law not for the common law for <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> families, but for the court noble law. This tendency was to be further increased in the Kenmu Code of the Muromachi <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> which placed its center in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, the central place of the court noble law. Like the court noble law, the Kenmu Code put forward 'thrift' and 'decorum,' and further put <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Goseibai-shikimoku (code of conduct for samurai).html">Goseibai-shikimoku</a> in its main position of the source of law as 'main code,' thus reportedly bugyonin (a magistrate) always had <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Goseibai-shikimoku (code of conduct for samurai).html">Goseibai-shikimoku</a> even in the actual lawsuit. That was because the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Goseibai-shikimoku (code of conduct for samurai).html">Goseibai-shikimoku</a> was comparable to the court noble law and widely accepted in the society since it incorporated the legal conception and 'tokuchi' doctrine (a doctrine for administration based on moral or humanity) common to the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> law and court noble law. That was pointed out by the facts that Shikimokusho (a commentary on <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Goseibai-shikimoku (code of conduct for samurai).html">Goseibai-shikimoku</a>) was compiled during the Sengoku period (period of warring states) of Japan, that the designation of 'shikimoku' was used for <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bunkokuho.html">bunkokuho</a> (the law individual sengoku-daimyo enforced in their own domain), and that many commentaries were written for it as well as it was used for a textbook for writing in the Edo period when a new system of law for <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> government was established. </p>
