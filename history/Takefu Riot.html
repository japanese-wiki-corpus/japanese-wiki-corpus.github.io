<h1>Takefu Riot (武生騒動)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Takefu riot was a rebellion that occurred in Echizen City, Fukui Prefecture in 1870 after the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Meiji Restoration (Meiji-ishin).html">Meiji Restoration</a>. </p>
<p>Background<br/>
At that time, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">Bakufu</a> (Shogunate) treated the Honda family, the ruler of Echizen City (the area previously known as Fusho City), with the equivalent of a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">Daimyo</a> treatment as a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Baishin (indirect vassal).html">baishin</a> (indirect vassals) of the Echizen-fukui Domain, however in the peerage system established by the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> government, the lord Sukemoto HONDA was ranked as a Shizoku (warrior class) not <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/family/Kazoku.html">Kazoku</a> (the peerage). His old retainers and townspeople were not happy about this therefore they demanded for a change and a rebellion had occurred. Many were arrested. In this rebellion, Yoshiomi SEKI, who was a member of the Kameyama Shachu and Kaientai (both were names of an association of leaderless warriors organized by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Ryoma SAKAMOTO.html">Ryoma SAKAMOTO</a>), was arrested for his involvement. </p>
<p>After the Rebellion<br/>
Sukemoto HONDA was raised to the peerage and he erected a monument of Fusahito in Ryosen-ji temple for the 15 retainers who fought and died in the rebellion. </p>
<p>The Takefu Riot is also known as the subject matter of the novel by Jiro NITTA. </p>
