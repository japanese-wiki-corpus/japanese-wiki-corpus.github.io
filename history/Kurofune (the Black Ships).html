<h1>Kurofune (the Black Ships) (黒船)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kurofune is a term used to refer to large, Western-style sea vessels, used before the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Edo Period.html">Edo Period</a> until the modern age. The term is presently used to refer to ships that came to Japan during the late <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Edo Period.html">Edo Period</a>. The term is mostly associated with the fleet of United States Navy ships, led by Matthew PERRY, that arrived off the coast of Uraga in 1853. </p>
<p>Perry's squadron<br/>
</p>
<p>Western ships of that day were called "black ships" because of the tar that was applied to the body of the ship. Because Perry's squadron included a steamship, many associate the term "black ships" with steamships, but it also refers to the sail ships. </p>
<p>Today, the term is used at times to symbolize external pressure on Japan, such as by capitalist powers, or entry of foreign capital in the country that can destroy existing conventions. </p>
<p><h3>Films featuring the Black Ships</h3>
</p>
<p>"Kurofune" is the Japanese title of a 1958 film by John Houston (Original title: "The Barbarian and the Geisha"). The film portrayed the US-Japan trade negotiations that took place at the end of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Edo Period.html">Edo Period</a>. John Wayne played the leading role. It was filmed on location in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and Nara. <h3>Others</h3>
</p>
<p>The term "Kuro-bune (black ship)" is also used for people who come from abroad and create news and/or start a new fad (such as sumo wrestler KONISHIKI, professional baseball player Bob HORNER, centerfold model Leah DIZON, and enka singer JERO), a foreign business that makes a break in the Japanese business market, new products that are brought to Japan from other countries (such as the iPhone), or anything that takes a stable market by storm, bring irreversible changes to a particular market and that at times may receive strong oppositiion from within Japan. </p>
