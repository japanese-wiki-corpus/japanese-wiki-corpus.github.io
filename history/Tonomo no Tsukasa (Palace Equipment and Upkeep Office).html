<h1>Tonomo no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Tsukasa (a rank in government offices).html">Tsukasa</a> (Palace Equipment and Upkeep Office) (殿司)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Tonomo no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Tsukasa (a rank in government offices).html">tsukasa</a> was one of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kokyu (empresss residence).html">kokyu</a> junishi (twelve offices belonging to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kokyu (empresss residence).html">kokyu</a>, empress's residence). They cleaned empress' residence and were in charge of interior lightings for the vehicle like a palanquin, lamp oil, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kashoku.html">kashoku</a>, charcoal fuelwood and so on. </p>
<p>As the staffs, it consisted of one Tonomo no kami (corresponding to Jurokui [Junior Sixth Rank]) and two Tonomo no suke (corresponding to Juhachii [Junior Eighth Rank]) and six nyoju (a court lady in a lower rank). </p>
<p>With the reorganization of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kokyu (empresss residence).html">kokyu</a> and the demise of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kokyu (empresss residence).html">kokyu</a> junishi after the middle of the Heian period, Tonomo no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Tsukasa (a rank in government offices).html">tsukasa</a> was incorporated into Tonomoryo (Imperial Palace Keeper's Bureau) and Tonomoryo began to send the staffs in Tonomo no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Tsukasa (a rank in government offices).html">tsukasa</a> to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Naishi no tsukasa.html">Naishi no tsukasa</a> (female palace attendants) and such a court lady was called court servant or court lady servant. The fixed number of court servants was 9 during the first half of twelfth century, but during the last half, seems to have been 12. </p>
