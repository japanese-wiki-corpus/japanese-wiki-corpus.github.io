<h3>An overview</h3>
</p>
<p><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Nobunaga ODA.html">Nobunaga ODA</a>, who conquered Owari, Mino, Ise and Omi Provinces, came up to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, making him <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshiaki ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshiaki ASHIKAGA</a>'s servant; then he conquered the areas in and around <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, and, in alliance with <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Ieyasu TOKUGAWA.html">Ieyasu TOKUGAWA</a> of Mikawa Province, promoted the seige of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Ishiyama Hongan-ji Temple.html">Ishiyama Hongan-ji Temple</a> (battles at Noda-jo Castle and Fukushima-jo Castle). The relationship between Nobunaga and Yoshiaki was good at first but gradually became worse and in 1570, Yoshiaki started his own diplomacy. Yoshiaki formed anti-Nobunaga network; he called for anti-Nobunaga powers and united them in Kinki region under his leadership. </p>
<p>At the same time, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Shingen TAKEDA.html">Shingen TAKEDA</a> of Kai Province conquered Shinano and expanded his territory; in his latter years, Shingen changed his diplomatic policies and started invading Suruga. After conquering Mino Province, as Nobunaga's territory had a border with Takeda's territory, Nobunaga established the friendly association with Shingen; when Shigen started invading Suruga, Nobunaga tried to reconciliate between Kai and Echigo with the help of Akiyoshi. However, after conquering Suruga, TAKEDA remade the Koso Alliance (an alliance between the Takeda clan in Kai Province and the Hojo clan in Sagami Province) and on October, 1571, he invaded Totomi and Mikawa Provinces in a large scale, which resulted in the decisive confrontation with the Oda and Tokugawa allied forces. </p>
<p>It is known that Shingen intended to come up to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> by driving out the Oda and Tokugawa allied forces; in 1572, Shingen started the strategy to conquer westward. In October, 1572, Shingen defeated Ieyasu in the Battle of Mikatagahara and kept going westward. In December, 1572, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshikage ASAKURA.html">Yoshikage ASAKURA</a>, who was confronting with the Oda force as Nagamasa ASAI's support arms, suddenly started withdrawing to his homeland. This withdrawal brought Shingen's plan of dispersing the ODA force to naught, which led to drastically slow down the TAKEDA force's speed of advance drastically. In March, 1573, Shogun Yoshiaki raised an army against Nobunaga, which Nobunaga repressed and on April, Shingen's strategy to conquer westward was discontinued due to his death. </p>
<p>Nobunaga, getting the information of Shingen's death, went on an offensive at a breath; nobody could stand up against Nobunaga, and one after another of the network was defeated impotently. Within one year after Shingen's death, the anti-Nobunaga forces, including ASAI, ASAKURA, and MIYOSHI, were killed by Nobunaga and Shogun Yoshiaki was expelled from <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. <h3>The Result</h3>
</p>
<p><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshiaki ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshiaki ASHIKAGA</a> was expelled from <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and went down to Bingo Province. He stayed with the Mori clan. </p>
<p>Nagamasa ASAI was attacked and killed by Nobunaga. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshikage ASAKURA.html">Yoshikage ASAKURA</a> was attacked and killed by Nobunaga. </p>
<p>After Shingen's death, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Ishiyama Hongan-ji Temple.html">Ishiyama Hongan-ji Temple</a>'s activities were settle down. </p>
<p>Saiga shu greatly troubled Nobunaga, but later yielded to him by giving him their written oath. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Enryaku-ji Temple.html">Enryaku-ji Temple</a> was destructed almost completely by Nobunaga's fire attack (in 1571). </p>

<p><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Hisahide MATSUNAGA.html">Hisahide MATSUNAGA</a> surrendered to Nobunaga. </p>
<p>After Shingen's death, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Katsuyori TAKEDA.html">Katsuyori TAKEDA</a>, Shingen's successor, withdrew to Kai Province, his hometown. </p>

<h3>The overview</h3>
</p>
<p>In 1576, some subordinated powers, including <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Hideharu HATANO.html">Hideharu HATANO</a> and Suketoyo YAMANA left the pro-Nobunaga group. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Ishiyama Hongan-ji Temple.html">Ishiyama Hongan-ji Temple</a> also raised an army. Although the Nobunaga's force, with a limited number of soldiers, defeated the Ishiyama Honganji-temple force, the former was defeated by the Mori navy at the first battle of Kizukawaguchi. Afterwards Nobunaga formed a hostile relationship with <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Kenshin UESUGI.html">Kenshin UESUGI</a>, which <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Hisahide MATSUNAGA.html">Hisahide MATSUNAGA</a> took as a good opportunity to attack Nobunaga (the Battle of Shigisan Castle). Saiga shu, Nagaharu BESSHO and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Murashige ARAKI.html">Murashige ARAKI</a>, who had promised to work for Nobunaga, broke the promise and stood up against Nobunaga. Nobunaga was forced to discontinue conquering Hokuriku region due to the defeat at the Battle at Tetori-gawa River. </p>
<p>Although Nobunaga faced a predicament, he was saved by the death of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Kenshin UESUGI.html">Kenshin UESUGI</a>, the strongest leader of the anti-Nobunaga network, in 1578; the anti-Nobunaga network collapsed in 1580, when <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Ishiyama Hongan-ji Temple.html">Ishiyama Hongan-ji Temple</a> surrendered to Nobunaga by opnening its gate. <h3>The Result</h3>
</p>
<p><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Hideharu HATANO.html">Hideharu HATANO</a> surrendered to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Mitsuhide AKECHI.html">Mitsuhide AKECHI</a>, the leader of the Kinki district attacking force and was executed; the HATANO clan were all killed. </p>
<p>Suketoyo YAMANA died while his territory was besieged by Hideyoshi HASHIBA's force, the Chugoku district attacking force. Akihiro YAMANA, Suketoyo's successor, surrendered to Hideyoshi and became his vassal. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Ishiyama Hongan-ji Temple.html">Ishiyama Hongan-ji Temple</a> made peace with Nobunaga and left Osaka (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Ishiyama War.html">Ishiyama War</a>). </p>
<p>Terumoto MORI could only defend himself from the successful offense of the Hideyoshi HASHIBA's force, the Chugoku district attacking force (the Battles of Kozuki Castle, Tottori-jo Castle and Bichu Takamatsu-jo Castle). </p>
<p>Naoie UKITA, considering his conditions disadvantageous, left the anti-Nobunaga network and made an alliance with Nobunaga. </p>
<p>Yoshimitsu MURAKAMI was in trouble since the Kurushima clan, who played an important role of the MURAKAMI navy, made an alliance with Nobunaga. </p>
<p>After <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Kenshin.html">Kenshin</a>'s death, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Kagekatsu UESUGI.html">Kagekatsu UESUGI</a>, who became the successor to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Kenshin.html">Kenshin</a> after the Otate War, could only defend himself from the successful offense of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Katsuie SHIBATA.html">Katsuie SHIBATA</a>'s force, the Hokuriku district attacking force. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Hisahide MATSUNAGA.html">Hisahide MATSUNAGA</a> was attacked and killed at the Battle of Shigisan Castle. </p>
<p>Saiga shu was attacked and almost killed completely by Nobunaga but barely escaped due to the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Honnoji Incident.html">Honnoji Incident</a>. </p>
<p>Nagaharu BESSHO was attacked and killed (the Battle of Miki). </p>
<p><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Murashige ARAKI.html">Murashige ARAKI</a> was attacked and escaped, abandoning his wife, children and castle garrisons. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Katsuyori TAKEDA.html">Katsuyori TAKEDA</a> was attacked and killed at the Battle of Tenmokuzan. <h3>Nobunaga's Ambition</h3>
</p>
<p>A game called 'anti-Nobunaga network' can be found in the fourth product, "Nobunaga's Ambition, Busho Fuunroku (Tales of the Military Commanders) " and almost all the games that follow the fourth of "Nobunaga's Ambition Series," a historical simulation game, produced by TECMO KOEI Holdings Co., Ltd,. A historically correct 'anti-Nobunaga network' game can be found; the group was formed in 1570 when <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshiaki ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshiaki ASHIKAGA</a>, who was confronted with Nobunaga, called for various feudal lords, such as the Takeda clan and Hongan-ji temple, to fight against the Oda clan and its alliance, the Tokugawa clan; the anti-Nobunaga feudal lords made alliance with each other. </p>
