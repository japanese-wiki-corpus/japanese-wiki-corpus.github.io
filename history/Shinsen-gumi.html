<p>The site of Shinsengumi military post at Mibu<br/>
</p>
<p>Shinsengumi was a military organization which, during the last days of the shogunate at the end of the Edo period, suppressed anti-shogunate forces and engaged in police activities, primarily in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, and fought for the Edo shogunate in the Boshin War. There are also many documents inscribed with "Shinsengumi" (with a slightly different character for "sen"). Even <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Isami KONDO.html">Isami KONDO</a>, a Commander, wrote it as both "選" and "撰". </p>
<p>Outline<br/>
It was placed under the control of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Katamori MATSUDAIRA.html">Katamori MATSUDAIRA</a>, the feudal lord of the Aizu Clan, who held the position of Kyoto Shugoshoku, which was established during the last days of the shogunate. In the Aizu Clan, the formal security force was the Kyoto Mimawarigumi (Commander = Tadazaburo SASAKI), and Shinsengumi (Commander = <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Isami KONDO.html">Isami KONDO</a>), composed of men with the social position of farmers/merchants, was the non-formal security force of the Aizu Clan for the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> area (in later years, KONDO and others became vassals of the shogunate, and thus Shinsengumi became a formal security force). Shinsengumi may be described as "a group of pro-shogunate killers" (actually their purpose was to capture, but there were too many lawless roshis who tried to escape, or who tried to attack them with their swords), and they were engaged through the Ikedaya Incident, etc., in controlling Sonno-joi extremists and lawless roshi's hiding in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. At the same time, KONDO and others were in a terrible struggle for power within Shinsengumi, and mercilessly killed their opponents. Significant number of men were purged on such grounds as violating internal rules, etc., and according to one view, more men lost their lives through such purges than through fighting with Imperial loyalists. </p>
<p>The ambition of Shinsengumi was to become <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a>, and with this goal in mind they were just as active as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a>, and modern day young people in particular regard them as a symbol of Japan during the last days of the shogunate, and Shinsengumi continues to be popular. Many female fans also visit the tombs of Shinsengumi members, who, together with Imperial loyalists such as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Ryoma SAKAMOTO.html">Ryoma SAKAMOTO</a>, are "idols of Japanese history"; but as the Meiji Government was established by Imperial loyalists who were opposed to them, hardly any notice was taken of Shinsengumi from a historical standpoint until recently, and their current popularity owes much to many novels about them written by such people as Kan SHIMOZAWA, Ryotaro SHIBA, and also TV dramas, movies, etc. </p>
<p>However, some people from Yamaguchi Prefecture and that area, which produced many Imperial loyalists, regard Shinsengumi as "a group of terrorists employed by the shogunate " (Masuo MATSUOKA, member of the House of Councilors/taken from his speech at the National Diet, during his time in office). </p>
<p>They are also known for setting strict Kyokuchu <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Hatto (Lecture Hall).html">Hatto</a> (Shinsengumi Rules) to maintain order within Shinsengumi, purging those who violated the rules, and for their group flag with one kanji character, "Makoto", and original short coats with mountain-like patterns painted on the sleeves. </p>
<p><h3>Establishment</h3>
</p>
<p>In 1862, upon the visit of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Iemochi TOKUGAWA.html">Iemochi TOKUGAWA</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Seii Taishogun.html">Seii Taishogun</a>, to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, the Edo shogunate recruited roshi for the purpose of guarding the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a>. This was because the shogunate accepted a proposal by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Hachiro KIYOKAWA.html">Hachiro KIYOKAWA</a>, a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Goshi (country samurai).html">Goshi</a> of the Shonai Clan. </p>
<p>On February 27 of the following year, 1863, over 200 roshis gathered and formed the group Roshi-gumi, and before the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a>'s trip traveled westward to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> via <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/road/Nakasen-do Road.html">Nakasen-do Road</a>. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Tadatoshi MATSUDAIRA.html">Tadatoshi MATSUDAIRA</a>, Kyuo UDONO, Jibuemon KUBOTA, Tesshu YAMAOKA, Kinnosuke NAKAJO, Tadazaburo SASAKI and others were assigned as Roshi Torishimari-yaku. After arriving in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, KIYOKAWA communicated secretly with imperial loyalist parties, and his scheme to make Roshi-gumi a force under control of the Emperor was discovered. After discussion among Roshi Torishimari-yaku, it was decided that Roshi-gumi would return to Edo in order to obstruct KIYOKAWA's plan. On the other hand, the Shiei-kan Party lead by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Isami KONDO.html">Isami KONDO</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Toshizo HIJIKATA.html">Toshizo HIJIKATA</a>, and the Mito Party lead by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Kamo SERIZAWA.html">Kamo SERIZAWA</a>, argued that they should remain in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> by all means, in order to guard the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a>. </p>
<p>Kyuo UDONO instructed <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshio TONOUCHI.html">Yoshio TONOUCHI</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Tsuguo IESATO.html">Tsuguo IESATO</a> of Roshi-gumi to recruit men to remain in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. In response to this, the Shiei-kan and Mito Parties, along with Yuzan NEGISHI and his group controlled by TONOUCHI, remained in Mibu Village of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, but the NEGISHI party withdrew immediately afterwards, TONOUCHI and IESATO were excluded, and in March of the same year "Mibu Roshi-gumi" (also known as "Seichu Roshi-gumi") was formed. Their purpose was to assist in carrying out Joi based on a union of the Imperial court and Edo shogunate. </p>
<p>They set military posts in the YAGI residence, MAEKAWA residence, and other locations in of Mibu Village, and conducted initial recruiting of members. As a result, Mibu Roshi-gumi became a group of about 36 men, and was assigned by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Katamori MATSUDAIRA.html">Katamori MATSUDAIRA</a>, Kyoto Shugoshoku, to control lawless acts by Sonno-joi extremists (loyalists aiming for overthrow of the shogunate), and guard in the city of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. </p>
<p>In August of the same year, Mibu Roshi-gumi was dispatched to subdue the Political Turmoil of August 18th, and was recognized for their efforts. On this occasion, they were granted a new group name. "Shinsengumi" was born. There are two stories regarding this name, one is that it was granted by Buke Denso (at that time, Sadaisa NOMIYA and Masanori ASUKAI), and the other is that it was granted by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Katamori MATSUDAIRA.html">Katamori MATSUDAIRA</a>, feudal lord of the Aizu Clan. <h3>Development</h3>
</p>
<p>In September 1863, KONDO, HIJIKATA and other members of Shiei-kan Party purged SERIZAWA and other Mito Party members, gained control of Shinsengumi, and established an organizational structure headed by KONDO. In the Ikedaya Incident of June 5, 1864, they prevented a planned uprising by the Sonno-joi Party, and also fought in the Forbidden Gates Incident. </p>
<p>After being awarded a letter of appreciation and a reward of over 200 ryo from the Imperial court/shogunate/Aizu Clan, they recruiting a second round of members, and when KONDO returned to Edo, he let Kinetaro ITO and his followers join Shinsengumi. Shinsengumi developed into a group of over 200 men, and to accommodate its members, moved its headquarters from Mibu military post to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Nishi Hongan-ji Temple.html">Nishi Hongan-ji Temple</a> (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Shimogyo Ward.html">Shimogyo Ward</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>). Around summertime of 1867, they were promoted to vassals of the shogunate. </p>
<p>In March 1867, ITO and his group, due to differences in ideology, were assigned the post of Goryo Eji and separated from Shinsengumi, but were purged by Shinsengumi in November of the same year. <h3>Dissolution</h3>
</p>
<p>In November 1867, Yoshinobu TOKUGAWA enacted <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Restoration of Imperial Rule (Japan).html">Restoration of Imperial Rule</a>. Although Shinsengumi fought in the Battle of Toba Fushimi together with the army of the former shogunate, they lost to the army of the new government. Subsequently, they moved to Edo on a war ship owned by the shogunate and headed by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Takeaki ENOMOTO.html">Takeaki ENOMOTO</a>. </p>
<p>Shisen-gumi was given a mission by the shogunate to prevent advancement of the new government's army into Kofu, changed their name to Koyo Chinbutai and set out, but lost the war. They returned to Edo after the Battle of Koshu-Katsunuma, but due to policy differences, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Shinpachi NAGAKURA.html">Shinpachi NAGAKURA</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Sanosuke HARADA.html">Sanosuke HARADA</a> and others separated to form Seihei-tai. Although <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Isami KONDO.html">Isami KONDO</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Toshizo HIJIKATA.html">Toshizo HIJIKATA</a> and others moved to Nagareyama and tried to regain power, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Isami KONDO.html">Isami KONDO</a> was caught by the army of the new government and executed, and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Soji OKITA.html">Soji OKITA</a> also died in Edo as his tuberculosis worsened. </p>
<p>Shinsengumi participated in the Battle of Utsunomiya Castle, the Battle of Aizu, and others, but in Aizu, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Hajime SAITO.html">Hajime SAITO</a> and others left the group. Subsequently, they joined <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Takeaki ENOMOTO.html">Takeaki ENOMOTO</a> and others who were aiming to establish the Republic of Ezo, and actively fought in the Battle of Futamataguchi. The army of the new government was advancing, and when <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Toshizo HIJIKATA.html">Toshizo HIJIKATA</a> and a few others tried to advance and rescue Shinsengumi who were fighting at Benten Daiba with the army of the new government, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Toshizo HIJIKATA.html">Toshizo HIJIKATA</a> was hit by a bullet and died, and as there was almost no food or water left, Shinsengumi surrendered. The army of the former shogunate surrendered to the army of the new government at Goryokaku in Hakodate.

</p>
<p>Kyokuchu <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Hatto (Lecture Hall).html">Hatto</a> (Kyokuchu Hatto-sho), together with Gunchu <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Hatto (Lecture Hall).html">Hatto</a>, are said to have been established to maintain order in Shinsengumi. The rules are said to have originated during the Roshi-gumi days, when members became Oazukari, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> serving the Aizu Clan, and KONDO and other Shiei-kan Party members handed down the rules to SERIZAWA and other Mito Party members. </p>
<p>The rules started to function as law when Roshi-gumi changed its name to "Shinsengumi," and the organization lead by KONDO/HIJIKATA had been well-established, and are said to have been applied when Kinetaro ITO and his group were purged. The contents were abstract, as can be seen in Article 1, "One should not act against the ways of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a>," and interpretation of the rules was up to the Commander or Vice Commander. The total number of Shinsengumi members purged up to the Battle of Toba Fushimi, including <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Kamo SERIZAWA.html">Kamo SERIZAWA</a> (initial Commander) and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Nishiki NIIMI.html">Nishiki NIIMI</a>, is 41. </p>
<p>The rules became famous after Kan SHIMOZAWA introduced them in his book "Shinsengumi Shimatsuki," and are known by the following 5 Articles, although no historical materials describing all 5 Articles have been found as of now. However, in the memoirs left by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Shinpachi NAGAKURA.html">Shinpachi NAGAKURA</a> in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> era there is mention of a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Hatto (Lecture Hall).html">Hatto</a> "Prohibition," consisting of 4 Articles, excluding "One shall not be allowed to engage in a private battle." Thus, it is assumed that Kyokuchu <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Hatto (Lecture Hall).html">Hatto</a> was created by SHIMOZAWA based on the above Prohibition, and by mixing "Gunchu <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Hatto (Lecture Hall).html">Hatto</a>" which had been separately set forth. Also, it has been pointed out that the rules are similar to Shin-mon Chou, on which the pupils of Tennen Rishin-ryu take a pledge. </p>
<p>One should not act against the ways of a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a>. One shall not be allowed to escape from the group. One shall not raise money at one's own discretion. One shall not handle cases at one's own direction. One shall not be allowed to engage in a private battle. A man violating the above Articles shall be ordered to commit hara-kiri. <h3>Maintenance of Public Order</h3>
</p>
<p>Due to the impact of many works which will be described later, there is a strong general understanding that Shinsengumi took a leading part in maintenance of public order in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> during the last days of the shogunate, but actually, the important area around the Imperial Palace was guarded by 2,000 elite troops under direct control of the Aizu Clan, and around that were another 500 men of Kyoto Mimawarigumi, composed of vassals of the shogunate. Shinsengumi was composed of 200 men, in charge of such areas as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Fushimi Ward.html">Fushimi Ward</a> (which in those days was a town that did not belong to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>). </p>
<p>Nevertheless, while Kyoto Mimawarigumi dutifully stayed in their area, Shinsengumi is said to have often gone outside their assigned area, for various reasons such reasons as escape of members, etc. </p>
<p>Equipment<br/>
<h3>Short coats</h3>
</p>
<p>They are said to have worn short coats colored very light blue, with mountain-like patterns painted in white at the sleeves, and most members in movies, etc., are usually wearing this coat. The mountain-like patterns on short coats are those of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Ako Roshi (lordless samurai of Ako Domain).html">Ako Roshi</a> of Chushingura, when they marched into and attacked the KIRA residence, and very light blue is said to be the color of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Seppuku.html">seppuku</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Kamishimo.html">kamishimo</a> worn by a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> when he commits hara-kiri, but the short coats of Shinsengumi seem to have been abolished after the 1st year, and the last recorded instance of the coats being worn was in the Ikedaya Incident. </p>
<p>The short coats were prepared by Daimonjiya Gofukuten (current Daimaru). Some say that it was not Daimonjiya but "Gofuku-donya Hishiya." Also, the group flag with one kanji character "Makoto" painted on it, is said to have been made by Takashimaya. <h3>Group Flag</h3>
</p>
<p>The group flag normally has a red background with a white "Makoto" character painted on it, and has mountain-like patterns the same as the short coats. Apparently, there is a secret meaning because when the flag flutters, the kanji character "Makoto" (誠) looks like the character "Shi" (試) used in "Shiei-kan" (試衛館) of KONDO's parents' home. It is sometimes said that this was because of HIJIKATA's ambition to strengthen KONDO and his followers. </p>
<p>There are also other group flags, thought to be 6 types in all. It is also said that when such group flags appeared, the enemies froze with fear. This flag was prepared on a special order, by Furugi Momen-sho, which is the current Takashimaya. <h3>Organization</h3>
</p>
<p>Shinsengumi was headed by a Commander who was supported by a Vice Commander, and under them were such functions as: Fukucho Jokin (Assistant Vice Commander), Kansatsu Gata (intelligence), Kanjo Gata (accounting), etc. Fukucho Jokin, as Kumicho, took command of non-officer members. There were No. 1 to No. 10 Kumi's, each with about 10 members. Gocho was placed under Kumicho. Furthermore, the organization of Shinsengumi was such that one person held one post, unlike many organizations in the Edo era where a post was generally held by more than one person, and influence of western military systems is pointed out. </p>
<p>Usually, the members were engaged in such activities as: practicing military arts, patrolling within <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>, and searching for roshi in hiding. Shinsengumi, was comprised of men with strong <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Kenjutsu (剣術) (Swordplay).html">kenjutsu</a> (fencing) abilities, and in addition to KONDO's Shiei-kan, Tennen Rishin-ryu, which was the main line, there were men of various <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Kenjutsu (剣術) (Swordplay).html">kenjutsu</a> schools, including Shindo Munen Ryu, Hokushin Itto Ryu, etc., and also members who learned <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Sojutsu (the art of the spearmanship).html">sojutsu</a> (spearmanship), <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Jujutsu (The traditional Japanese martial arts).html">jujutsu</a> (judo), etc., and they used group fighting tactics, with emphasis on actual fighting. </p>
<p>It is assumed that they were short of funds upon start of the group, but during the time when the group was placed under the control of Kyoto Shugoshoku, operating expenses of the group were covered by goyo-kin financed from the Aizu Clan. Also, wealthy merchants, etc., were made to provide part of the funds. Subsequently, when they became vassals of the shogunate, each member received wages from the shogunate. Rewards were also given when they were dispatched to various cases. </p>
<p>The following is a list of members. Including periods prior to using the group name of Shinsengumi (Mibu Roshi-gumi). <h3>Physician</h3>
</p>
<p><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Ryojun MATSUMOTO.html">Ryojun MATSUMOTO</a>, President of the shogunate's School of Western Medicine, conducted medical examination of the members upon invitation of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Isami KONDO.html">Isami KONDO</a>, and also acted as an army surgeon during the Boshin War. </p>
<p>Ryojin MATSUMOTO also recommended that Shinsengumi raise pigs, and when they were stationed in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Nishi Hongan-ji Temple.html">Nishi Hongan-ji Temple</a>, piglets brought in from Kobe were raised (fed on leftovers), and MATSUMOTO made members eat pork. They asked a pupil of Seiichi NANBU, physician of Kiya-machi, to butcher the pigs. <h3>Works About Shinsengumi</h3><ins class="adsbygoogle" style="display:block" data-ad-client="ca-pub-6625151359627561" data-ad-slot="2955832603" data-ad-format="auto" data-full-width-responsive="true"></ins></p>
<p>Only the works where Shinsengumi is the main subject will be described. In many works covering the last days of the shogunate, Shinsengumi appears as the enemy. After the establishment of the New Meiji Government, in which men from the former Satsuma and Choshu Clans played leading roles, and before the Pacific War, Shinsengumi, which had been opposed to the Imperial loyalists, was seen as the enemy in many cases, based on the historical view that Japan was a country developing under the rule of the Emperor. When Kan SHIMOZAWA made his Shinsengumi Sanbusaku public in the early Showa era, Shinsengumi's notoriety increased, and along with the reversal of views after the World War II, there were more cases where Shinsengumi was given the leading role, and attention was given to each member, and works were produced based on the members. As an aftereffect of the above, many works were produced that were set at a different period of time, but used the structure of Shinsengumi and its well-known members as a motif. </p>
