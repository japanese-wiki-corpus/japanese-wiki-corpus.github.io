<h1>Hachigyaku (eight unpardonable crimes) (八虐)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Hachigyaku means the eight most serious crimes in the ritsuryo code. In principle, those who committed these crimes were executed. Even nobles were neither given reduction of the penalty nor granted amnesty. Not only crimes against nation or emperor, but also those against shrines or ancestors were included in the Hachigyaku, which indicates the fact that the social order based on status was valued. It is based on 'Juaku' (ten evils) in the Tang Ritsuryo Code, but 'Fuboku' (family trouble) and 'Nairan' (crimes that disturb the family, particularly adultery, incest etc.; the meaning is different from that of today) were excluded. </p>
<p>Summary<br/>
Muhen is the crime of killing emperors (including attempted murder and preparation of murder). It was considered to be the greatest crime. </p>
