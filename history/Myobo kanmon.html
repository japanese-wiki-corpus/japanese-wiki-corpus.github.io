<h1>Myobo <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/kanmon.html">kanmon</a> (明法勘文)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Myobo <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/kanmon.html">kanmon</a> is <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/kanmon.html">kanmon</a> (report) prepared by scholars (Myobo-ke) of Myobodo (study of Codes) including Myobo hakase to respond to consultation. It is mainly responses to the Imperial Court and In no cho (Retired Emperor's Office) asking for legal interpretation of Laws of codes and ethics (conduct) concerning specific accidents and problems, but sometimes it contains answers to specific questions from the Emperor and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kugyo.html">Kugyo</a> (the top court officials) and self-answered questions. </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>Normally an imperial decree intended by the Emperor or Daijokan (Grand Council of State) was handed down via recorders of gekikyoku (Secretaries' Office of the Council of State) or Benkankyoku (Controllers' Office) to Myobo hakase, who replied in the form of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/kanmon.html">kanmon</a>. At first such an imperial decree was formally handed down to an instruction group of Myobo hakase called 'Myobo-zoshi' but after the ninth century it was handed down to Myobo hakase personally. The scope of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/kanmon.html">kanmon</a> covered both criminal and civil affairs, and later reports on matters which were not directly related to Myobodo were sometimes submitted. In the tenth century, when the authority related to trials of government officials' crimes was moved to Jin no sadame (ancient cabinet council) of Daijokan, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/kanmon.html">kanmon</a> concerning charges and penalties of crime accounted for the large majority of Myobo <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/kanmon.html">kanmon</a>, so they were especially called 'Zaimyo <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/kanmon.html">kanmon</a>' (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/kanmon.html">kanmon</a> for charges). </p>
<p>The oldest Myobo <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/kanmon.html">kanmon</a> in Japan is the one concerning interpretation of Regulations for selection of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Taiho Ritsuryo (Taiho Code).html">Taiho Ritsuryo</a> (Taiho Code) included in "Hosoruirin," and was replied by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Fuhito.html">FUJIWARA no Fuhito</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Dainagon (chief councilor of state).html">Dainagon</a> (Major Counselor) and Kadono no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Okimi (great king) (Yamato sovereignty).html">Okimi</a>, Shikibukyo, who were involved in compilation of Taiho Code and also served as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Ryokan (Japanese-style inns).html">Ryokan</a>, because there was no government post of Myobo hakase in those days. In addition, the oldest record of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/kanmon.html">kanmon</a> created by Myobo is the one concerning the replacement of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kokushi.html">Kokushi</a> in the article of October 14, 758 of "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Shoku Nihongi (Chronicle of Japan Continued).html">Shoku Nihongi</a>" (Chronicle of Japan Continued). Three <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/kanmon.html">kanmon</a> written by daihanji (judge) <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/SANUKI no Naganao.html">SANUKI no Naganao</a>, Myobo hakase 御輔長道 and Sadaishi (senior recorder of the left) 川枯勝成 in the so-called 'Zengai Jiken'(described in the article of December 6, 846 of "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Shoku Nihon Koki (Later Chronicle of Japan, Continued).html">Shoku Nihon Koki</a>" (Later Chronicle of Japan Continued)), in which benkan Yoshio TOMONO accused all of his five fellow <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Benkan (Collective name of posts in Daijokan).html">benkan</a> of violating Soni ryo (Regulations for Monks and Nuns) in their customary public administration which had been implemented for many years, are well known. </p>
<p>In the mid Heian period, buntai (literary style) of Myobo <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/kanmon.html">kanmon</a> was generally fixed. At the beginning, the matter to be reported is written in a sentence, "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Kanjin.html">Kanjin</a>... no koto," and the body text starts in the next line. First, the body text of an imperial decree to which <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/kanmon.html">kanmon</a> replies is cited. Next, the body text of Laws of codes and ethics (conduct) upon which <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/kanmon.html">kanmon</a> is based is cited (this is stipulated in Laws of codes and ethics (conduct) concerning conviction of 断獄律). The text body of "Ritsu-no-shuge" and "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ryonoshuge (Commentaries on the Civil Statutes).html">Ryonoshuge</a>," commentaries compiled by Imperial command, is cited in the same format. Next, the proposer's comment and conclusion, which are called 'Kanketsu' are shown. </p>
<p>Such <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/kanmon.html">kanmon</a> were used as conference materials in Jin no sadame and In no hyojo (consultation under the government by the retired Emperor) and included in many works by Myobo-ke such as "Hosoruirin" and "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Seiji yoryaku.html">Seiji yoryaku</a>," and later treated as one of the sources of court noble laws. Myobo <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/kanmon.html">kanmon</a> had been actively created by the period of the Northern and Southern Courts (Japan), when the political power of the Imperial Court and In no cho was well retained in and around <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, but Myobodo declined with the downfall of such political power and Myobo <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/kanmon.html">kanmon</a> were no longer created. </p>
