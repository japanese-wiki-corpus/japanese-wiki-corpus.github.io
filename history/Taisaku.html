<h1>Taisaku (対策)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Taisaku is:<br/>
Currently, a countermeasure taken against a certain issue or other party's attitudes. 
<br/>But, the use of the term such as 'Taisaku for energy savings' is not correct because it means 'Taisaku for preventing the implementation of energy savings.'<br/>

<p>Recruitment examination in the Heian period<br/>
Details are below:<br/>
</p>
<p>Taisaku was also called kensaku (recommended proposal), horyaku shi (exam for selecting government officials), shusai (or kakyo) shi, monjo tokugosho shi. 
<br/>In Tang Dynasty China, the Emperor gave current affairs or creed related tests called 'sakumon,' and warriors wrote answers to the Emperor's questions, which was called 'taisakumon.'<br/>
This program was introduced to Japan, and as Kidendo (called 'Monjodo,' a department of the Monjoin that was established to study Chinese-style poems or history) became popular in the early Heian period, exams were introduced and Monjo hakase (professors of literature and history at Daigaku-ryo, the Bureau of Education under the Ritsuryo system) gave 'sakumon' to Monjo tokugosho and had them take this examination, known as 'taisaku.'<br/>
If they passed the test, they were hired as government officials, and this test was the highest level national exam for that time. Those Monjosho who were not Confucian and could not become Monjo tokugosho, made a special petition for Horyaku senshi (an imperial letter) to take the 'taisaku' exam. Taisakumon drew Chinese historical events and was poor in content, and was gradually becoming formalized, but the test itself continued until the Muromachi period. </p>
