<h1><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Shosoin.html">Shosoin</a> monjo (正倉院文書)</h1>
<p></p>
<p><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Shosoin.html">Shosoin</a> monjo refers to document collections kept in Todai-ji Temple <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Shosoin.html">Shosoin</a>, which are mainly created by the Sutra copying office at <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Todai-ji Temple.html">Todai-ji Temple</a>. 
<br/>(In its narrow sense, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Shosoin.html">shosoin</a> monjo refers to documents created by the Sutra copying office located in Chuso [the middle section] of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Todai-ji Temple.html">Todai-ji Temple</a>.)<br/>
(Besides this, there are hokuso monjo (documents kept in the north section of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Todai-ji Temple.html">Todai-ji Temple</a>.)<br/>
<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Shosoin.html">Shosoin</a> monjo are historical materials including a wealth of information on the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Nara Period.html">Nara Period</a>. </p>
<p>Most of the monjo which were created by authorities and reports collected from various provinces under <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ritsuryo.html">ritsuryo</a> system (the historical law system based on the philosophies of Confucianism and Chinese Legalism in Japan) were disposed of after a short period (except koseki [Japanese family registry] - these were kept a little longer, for about 30 years), but the Sutra copying office at <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Todai-ji Temple.html">Todai-ji Temple</a> used the back sides of the waste monjo as ledger paper. Since the monjo created by the Sutra copying office during the 8th century (for about 50 years from the Jinki to Hoki era, [724 - 781]) were placed and have been preserved in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Shosoin.html">Shosoin</a>, valuable historical materials including koseki and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shozeicho (balance sheets of tax rice).html">shozeicho</a> (balance sheets of tax rice) created in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Nara Period.html">Nara Period</a> still remain today. </p>
<p>In the late <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Edo Period.html">Edo Period</a>, Tadatomo HOIDA (a scholar of Japanese classical literature taught by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Atsutane HIRATA.html">Atsutane HIRATA</a>) took notice of the historical materials which were written on the back side of monjo from the Sutra copying office; some monjo were picked out in order to restore those kosei and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shozeicho (balance sheets of tax rice).html">shozeicho</a> to their original states, and these were then compiled into 45 volumes (master document) from 1833 to 1836. After the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period, those documents continued to be organised by the Ministry of Home Affairs and the Ministry of the Imperial Household, resulting in 667 volumes and 5 books. Although this led to a dramatic advance in the study of monjo, the monjo created by the Sutra copying office has been broken into pieces and has turned into something different from its original form. </p>
<p>Toshio FUKUYAMA, an architectural historian, restored and studied historical materials related to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Ishiyama-dera Temple.html">Ishiyama-dera Temple</a>, which were included in monjo created by the Sutra copying office and clearly showed the construction procedures for <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Ishiyama-dera Temple.html">Ishiyama-dera Temple</a> (constructed from 761) ('Construction of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Ishiyama-dera Temple.html">Ishiyama-dera Temple</a> in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Nara Period.html">Nara Period</a>,' 1933, included in "Nihon kenchiku shi no kenkyu" [Complete Works of the History of Japanese Architecture]). After his research, more research on monjo created by the Sutra copying office has been done. </p>
<p><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Shosoin.html">Shosoin</a> monjo was published as "Dai Nihon <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Komonjo.html">Komonjo</a>" (Old Documents of Japan) (chronology monjo, 25 books, 1901-1940). Although the original documents remain unpublicized, some of them are publicized at the Annual Exhibition of Shosoin Treasures in fall (held at <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Nara National Museum.html">Nara National Museum</a>) while they are being aired at <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Shosoin.html">Shosoin</a>. </p>
