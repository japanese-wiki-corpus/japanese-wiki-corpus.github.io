<h1>Jidoku (imperial tutor) (侍読)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>A Jidoku/Jito was a scholar who was an academic tutor for the emperor. </p>
<p>Under the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ritsuryo.html">Ritsuryo</a> system (a system of centralized government based on the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ritsuryo.html">ritsuryo</a> code), a professor of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Daigaku-ryo.html">Daigaku-ryo</a> (Bureau of Education under the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ritsuryo.html">ritsuryo</a> system) or an individual with similar education and experience was appointed to the position of Jidoku. The main subjects that a Jidoku lectured on were from Confucian scriptures, including the Shishogokyo (Four Books and Five Classics of Confucianism, the Nine Chinese Classics). Other materials they lectured on included the "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shiki (a rank in government offices under ritsuryo system).html">Shiki</a>" (a Chinese history book), "Monzen" (Wen-hsen, Ancient Chinese Poems) and "Roshi Dotokukyo" (Lao-tzu - The Way and its Virtue). After the late Heian period, the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/family/Oe clan.html">Oe clan</a> and the Sugawara clan monopolized the position of Jidoku with the hereditary title of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kidendo.html">Kidendo</a> hakase (chief experts on the history of Japan and China) (Monjo hakase (professor of literature)). Scholars who tutored the family heads of the Sekkan-ke (families which produced regents) and the family of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> also came to be called Jidoku. </p>
