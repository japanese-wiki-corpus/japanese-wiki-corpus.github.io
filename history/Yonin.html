<h1>Yonin (遥任)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>遥任 (yonin) (the expression of 遙任 was also used sometimes) indicates that the person who was appointed to a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kokushi.html">kokushi</a> (governor) of a province did not live in the province. It was also called yoju (遥授 or 遙授 in Chinese characters). Yonin <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kokushi.html">kokushi</a> received his income, salary, and taxes from his deputy called <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Mokudai.html">mokudai</a> who was sent to the province. </p>
<p><h3>History</h3>
</p>
<p>The yonin practice existed from around the Nara period, but was used only rarely at that time. This was because, during the Nara period, control based upon the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ritsuryo.html">Ritsuryo</a> system (a system of centralized government based on the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ritsuryo.html">ritsuryo</a> code) functioned effectively and, to extend the control based on the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ritsuryo.html">Ritsuryo</a> system over every part of the country, it was necessary for the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kokushi.html">kokushi</a> to move to the assigned province to maintain direct control. </p>
<p>However, entering the Heian period, the following custom began to be employed: When there was a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Sangi.html">Sangi</a> (councilor) while being a legislator, was awarded with a small number of shikifu (or fuko) (families that the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Sangi.html">Sangi</a> could control), he was appointed to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kokushi.html">kokushi</a> as well, with his yonin approved, (called sangikenkokusei - literally, the system in which a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Sangi.html">Sangi</a> was allowed to assume a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kokushi.html">kokushi</a> as well). In the Tencho period (824 -834), Kazusa Province, Hitachi Province and Kozuke Province were assigned to shinno-ninkoku (see below). A shinno-ninkoku indicates a province where, to assign a governmental position to each of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Shinno (Imperial Prince).html">shinno</a> (princes) whose number had increased, the post of the provincial government head (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kokushi.html">kokushi</a>) was allocated to a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Shinno (Imperial Prince).html">shinno</a>. Because it never happened that a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Shinno (Imperial Prince).html">shinno</a> moved to the province to whose <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kokushu.html">kokushu</a> he was appointed, it can be said that the Imperial court publicly approved the yonin system. </p>
<p>In the ninth or tenth century, powerful farmers called fugo appeared and continued to increase their strength in various areas of the country. At that time, it became difficult to maintain control over each person like in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ritsuryo.html">Ritsuryo</a> system (a system of centralized government based on the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ritsuryo.html">ritsuryo</a> code), based on a family registration system and Handen Shuju ho (the law of periodic reallocations of rice land), and therefore, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kokushi.html">kokushi</a> (provincial governors) reorganized <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Koden.html">Koden</a> (fields administered directly by a ruler) into <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Myoden.html">myoden</a> (rice field lots in charge of a nominal holder) and came to entrust the work of managing <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Myoden.html">myoden</a> and collecting taxes from there to powerful farmers (called tato). Such a control system was called myotaisei or ochotaisei, and with this system, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kokushi.html">kokushi</a> able to secure a certain amount of tax income. </p>
<p>Against this background, the Imperial court started entrusting tax collection and military affairs to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kokushi.html">kokushi</a>. This system is sometimes called <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kokushi.html">Kokushi</a> ukeoi sei (literally, a system entrusted to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kokushi.html">kokushi</a>). Given wide-ranging rights, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kokushi.html">kokushi</a> came to control his assigned province through the local powerful persons he employed or his deputy (called <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Mokudai.html">mokudai</a>) that he sent to the province. Then the necessity of his moving to the assigned province became weak, and there appeared many <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kokushi.html">kokushi</a>, one after another, who did not actually move to their assigned provinces actually. This was the yonin during the Heian period, and the number of yonin-kokushi increased with the times. In such a situation, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Daigo.html">Emperor Daigo</a> issued in 913 a law to control yonin-kokushi, but could not gain any substantial results. </p>
<p>By the middle era of the Heian period, yonin had become a usual practice. Then, the head of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kokushi.html">kokushi</a> who actually moved to their assigned province became called <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Zuryo (The Head of The Provincial Governors).html">zuryo</a>. Originally, the highest position of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kokushi.html">kokushi</a> was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kokushu.html">kokushu</a>, but when <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kokushu.html">kokushu</a> did not live in his assigned province, a person at the rank of suke, jo or <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Sakan (Kokushi).html">sakan</a> (these ranks were in this order, with suke the highest) was appointed to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Zuryo (The Head of The Provincial Governors).html">zuryo</a>. </p>
<p>After that, until the Muromachi period when <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kokushi.html">kokushi</a> was virtually extinct, the yonin of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kokushi.html">kokushi</a> did not stop and became ordinary practice. </p>
