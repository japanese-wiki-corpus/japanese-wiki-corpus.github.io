<h1>Shotenroku (premium) (賞典禄)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Shotenroku was a premium which the government gave as a bonus in addition to a hereditary stipend to court nobles, Japanese feudal lords and members of the warrior class who contributed a great deal to Meiji Restoration. Depending on its benefit period, it is classified into three types including a permanent premium, a lifetime premium and a limited period premium. </p>
<p>Summary<br/>
The battles against the former Tokugawa troop and the supporting domains of the Shogun, from the Boshin War to the Battle of Hakodate, were assisted by not only the court nobles and samurai belonging to the Meiji Government but also domains waiting and seeing how things went at first. When it became an issue how to anchor them to the new government even after the battles, rewards for the domains, troop and individuals who respectively contributed to the battles were considered. Although due to the financial resources an opposing argument appeared inside the new government, it decided to give rewards for fear that the domains' financial aggravation caused by military expenses in the battles might create ill feeling against it. </p>
<p>On June 2, 1869, the government gave the premiums to 419 people who achieved distinguished military service at the Boshin War, troops, domains, and battleships. The total was 745,750 koku (a unit of volume: rice 1-koku is 180.39 liter) of rice and 203,376 ryo (a unit of gold currency) in cash. The highest amount was 100,000 koku given to the lord of Kagoshima Domain Tadayoshi SHIMAZU and his father Hisamitsu SHIMAZU and the lords of Yamaguchi Domain Takachika MORI and his son Motonori MORI, followed by 40,000 koku given to the lords of Kochi Domain Toyoshige YAMAUCHI and his adopted son Toyonori YAMAUCHI, while the highest amount among feudal retainers of domain was 2,000 koku given to Takamori SAIGO. On September 14 of the same year, a total of 35,220 koku was given to those who achieved meritorious services in the Battle of Hakodate and 85,500 koku of limited period premium for three years (28,500 koku per year) was given to nine people and nine battle ships. On the 26th of the same month, the premium was conferred on meritorious vassals in the Restoration of Imperial Rule. The total was 35,150 koku of rice (including 7,050 koku of lifetime premiums for eight people) and 1,500 ryo in cash. The highest amount was 5,000 koku given to each of Sanetomi SANJO and Tomomi IWAKURA followed by 1,800 koku given to each of Takayoshi KIDO, Toshimichi OKUBO and Saneomi HIROSAWA. All premiums mentioned above without notes are permanent premiums. </p>
<p>As a general rule, 2.5 to (a unit of volume, approx. 18 liters) of rice was given per koku except for premium money which was given as a one-time allowance. In some domains, feudal retainers got a part of their lords' premiums as reward grants. It is called a distributed premium. These premiums were funded through confiscated territories of domains that were defeated in the Boshin War. Premiums together with hereditary stipends brought about financial aggravation. </p>
<p>The total amount of premiums was 901,620 koku which was consisted of 809,070 koku for permanent premiums, 7,050 koku for life time premiums, and 85,500 for limited period premiums. </p>
<p>In 1876, government bonds of monetary salary caused the premium to be abolished. </p>
