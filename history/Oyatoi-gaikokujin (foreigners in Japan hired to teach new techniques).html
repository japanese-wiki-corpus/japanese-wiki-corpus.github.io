<p></p>
<p>The term "oyatoi-gaikokujin" refers to the practice, common from the late Edo period into the early <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period, of hiring Europeans and Americans to foster the importation into Japan of the advanced technologies, scholarship and systems of Europe and the United States under the banner of '<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shokusan-kogyo (encouragement of new industries).html">Shokusan-kogyo</a>' (encouragement of production and industry). Such foreigners were invited to Japan by the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Edo bakufu.html">Edo bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>) and by various regional domains; beginning in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period, they were invited by the new <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> government, prefectural offices, or by the private sector. In the final years of the Edo period, each domain competed in the hiring of foreigners to serve their lords; as such, they were also called Okakae-gaikokujin (foreigners in service). </p>
<p>Although broadly speaking the designation oyatoi-gaikokujin also included the employees of foreign diplomatic missions in Japan as well as the (foreign) guards at the foreign settlements, for the purposes of this article the term will be used only for those foreigners who were employed by the Japanese government in order to foster the learning of new technologies and scholarship from Europe and the United States. </p>
<p>Summary<br/>
Oyatoi-gaikokujin were employed to teach native Japanese the latest technologies and knowledge from Europe and the United States in order to fuel the process of Japan's modernization. These foreigners would have a lasting influence on various fields, including industry, politics and academia, for generations thereafter. From the early days of the Edo period, there had been foreigners hired for this purpose in Japan, notably Jan JOOSTEN and William ADAMS, both highly esteemed and well treated by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Ieyasu TOKUGAWA.html">Ieyasu TOKUGAWA</a>, who valued them as advisers to the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> on foreign diplomacy or technology; there was also the example of Philipp Franz Balthasar von SIEBOLD, who was employed briefly as an adviser for the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>. However, it was not until after the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Meiji Restoration (Meiji-ishin).html">Meiji Restoration</a>, which saw the end of the long period of national isolation and the beginning of Japan's search for models abroad, that the Japanese government began the full-scale hiring of foreigners. </p>
<p>In 1855 of the end of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Edo Period.html">Edo Period</a>, the Tokugawa shogunate established a Japanese Naval School in Nagasaki and invited several Dutchmen, notably Willem Huyssen van KATTENDIJKE, to serve as advisers on military affairs. As a consequence, in the early days of the Japanese Navy it was primarily Dutchmen who led the way; with the birth of the new <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> government, however, Englishmen were employed as advisers, and as such, the administration of the Navy followed the British model. As regards the developmental pedigree of the Japanese Army, under the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> military advisers were invited from France. However, because the efforts of this advisory group ended in defeat at the battle of Hakodate during the Boshin War, and perhaps also because Prussia (Germany) won the Franco-Prussian War, the new <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> government overturned its military system and decided to invite an advisory group from Germany. </p>
<p>As regards the project of reclaiming the land of Hokkaido, most people invited to participate were from the United States of America. 
<br/>The Dutch had risen to influential positions by the end of the Edo period, and after the Restoration many Dutchmen, notably Johannis de RIJKE, were hired in the field of river engineering (It is said that this was because Dutch flood control technology was highly praised by those connected to this field of engineering; however, a different theory holds that the large-scale hiring of Dutch river engineers was due to the nepotism of Dr. Anthonius Franciscus BAUDUIN and his younger brother.)<br/>
Italians were employed at schools for craftsmanship and art. </p>
<p>Reference: The 1975 document entitled "Shiryo: Oyatoi-gaikokujin"(Document on Hired Foreigners) lists the names of 2,299 people with foreign nationalities who were employed by Japanese public and private institutions as well as by individuals between 1868 and 1889 (the list includes the names of families and employees at the foreign diplomatic missions). The breakdown by nationality is 928 Englishmen, 374 Americans, 259 Frenchmen, 253 Chinese, 175 Germans, 87 Dutch, and several others of various nationalities. </p>
<p>It is well-known that Oyatoi-gaikokujin were highly paid. During an era in which the top-level ministers in the government were being paid monthly salaries of a few hundred yen, foreigners were being paid a monthly wage that ranged between several hundred yen to over one thousand. Even compared to national wage levels in an era when the status difference between social classes was very large, such a salary was extremely high. The high salaries were partly due to the fact that the yen was extremely weak internationally, but mainly because of the difficulty in convincing top-class experts in technology and knowledge to come to Japan, which from the perspective of Westerners was a country on the extreme eastern edge of the Far East, a country moreover that held considerable physical danger for foreigners. </p>
<p>The vast majority of foreigners returned to their own countries upon completing the tasks for which they had been hired. Although there were some Oyatoi-gaikokujin who were drifters who came to Japan thinking to strike it rich, notably Thomas James WALTERS, or arrogant and looked down on the Japanese such as Charles Alfred Chastel de BOINVILLE, there were many others who deeply appreciated Japan and were greatly respected by their (Japanese) disciples. There were those such as Yakumo KOIZUMI (Lafcadio Hearn), Josiah CONDOR and Edwin DUN who found themselves captivated by Japanese culture, and chose to remain in Japan for the rest of their lives. </p>
<p>Graves of oyatoi-gaikokujin<br/>
Some Oyatoi-gaikokujin were buried in graveyards in Japan. The grave of Yakumo KOIZUMI (Lafcadio Hearn) is treated as a major tourist attraction for the city of Matsue in Shimane Prefecture. Although Fenollosa died in London, he was laid to rest in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Onjo-ji Temple.html">Onjo-ji Temple</a> (also known as Mii-dera Temple). </p>
<p>In Aoyama Cemetery, a graveyard for foreign residents in Tokyo, some of the graves are of foreigners who no longer have any known relatives, as a consequence of which the maintenance fee (590 yen yearly as of 2005) has not been paid for many years. In such cases, the remains are usually reclassified as muen botoke (a person who has died leaving nobody to look after his or her grave) and reburied in a communal grave; but in the fiscal year of 2006, as reported by the Yomiuri Shimbun (the Daily Yomiuri) on February 18, 2005, in the case of the Aoyama Cemetery the Tokyo Metropolitan Government re-evaluated 78 graves of Oyatoi-gaikokujin for which the maintenance fee has not been paid as important from the perspective of cultural history, and it plans to preserve them as historical sites. </p>

<h3>A note on the definition of 'oyatoi'</h3></p>
<p>Oyatoi' refers to the hiring of someone (unnecessary to be a foreigner) who does not belong to a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> family for his or her special skills or knowledge in order to accomplish the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>'s 'goyo' (official business). In the latter half of the Edo period, as the Japanese became aware of the trends affecting foreign countries, it became clear that the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a>'s <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> retainers would not be able to master the bewildering array of specialized fields by themselves. Therefore, the government began to employ especially talented non-samurai commoners in order to meet the new needs facing them. However, from the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Point (Sentoki).html">point</a> of view of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>, these employees were and would always remain of 'oyatoi' (hired) status, and as such, their social position was fully as low as that of temporary employees. Some of these hirees, however, did earn recognition for their abilities and achievements, and were promoted to the status of full retainers and granted family names, allowed to carry swords, and given hereditary rights to their status. </p>
