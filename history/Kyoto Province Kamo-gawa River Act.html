<h1>Kyoto Province Kamo-gawa River Act (京都府鴨川条例)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The Kyoto Province Kamo-gawa River Act is an act by Kyoto Province. It was promulgated on 10 July 2007 and introduced on 1 April 2008. </p>
<p>Its purpose is 'to promote the policy to achieve a peaceful, safe, good and comfortable environment for Kamo-gawa River and other rivers, and to hand down provincial heritage Kamo-gawa River and other rivers to our descendants' (from the preamble). It was the first act as general regulation for rivers in Japan. The Shimanto-gawa River Act' of Kochi Province is a similar act. </p>

Chapter 2: Ensuring security and safety (Article 6 and 7)<br/>
Chapter 3: Preservation of a good environment for rivers<br/>

Supplementary rules<br/>
</p>
<p>Kamo-gawa River and other rivers<br/>
The designated area for regulation is 'Kamo-gawa River and other rivers'. Kamo-gawa River and other rivers' includes Kamo-gawa River (Yodo-gawa River system) and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Takano-gawa River.html">Takano-gawa River</a> (<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a>). Since 'Kamo-gawa River (鴨川)' is commonly considered to indicate the rivers which are designated by River Act as 'the class A river Yodo-gawa River system Kamo-gawa River', it is supposed to include the north area of the meeting of Kamo-gawa River and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Takano-gawa River.html">Takano-gawa River</a> as well, although the river of the area is written as '賀茂川' or '加茂川' (the pronunciations are the same as '鴨川'). </p>
<p>Contents of the regulation<br/>
For the preservation of a good environment for rivers, '<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Noryo-yuka (also called as Noryo-doko - breeze-enjoying floor).html">Noryo-yuka</a> (famous wooden terraces)' by Kamo-gawa River is to be applied to the Administrative Procedure Act Chapter 2, which the governor has the authority to permit. To ensure comfortable use, these acts below are regulated, and punishments for violations are provided. </p>
<p>Bicycles and other vehicles prohibited. Parking bicycles and motorcycles prohibited. Use of fireworks and other similar acts (using smoke and fire to propel objects, shoot off objects and make explosions) prohibited. Graffiti prohibited. Barbecues and other similar acts (roasting or broiling food on a fire) prohibited. Graffiti is prohibited in whole area of 'Kamo-gawa River and other rivers', the other violation acts are prohibited within the designated area which was notified in the notices by <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>. For example, barbecues are prohibited near Hiiragino-entei Bank as well as in the vicinity of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/railway/Demachiyanagi Station.html">Demachiyanagi Station</a> and Kamo-ohashi Bridge. </p>
<p>Fireworks are prohibited all day. </p>
<p>Double administrative management<br/>
As to bicycles parked on the roads illegally, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a> hitherto had management of removing those bicycles by 'the Kyoto City Prevention Act against Parked Bicycle and Other Vehicles'. However, on the introduction of the Kamo-gawa River Act, as to bicycles parked illegally on the designated area by the rivers, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a> began the management. It was pointed out to be inefficient, so recently those managements are being adjusted in 'the Panel Discussion for the Administrative Cooperation' as a part of the cooperation between the prefecture and the city. </p>
