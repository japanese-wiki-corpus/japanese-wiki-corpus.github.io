<h1>Ako Roshi (lordless <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> of Ako Domain) (赤穂浪士)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Ako Roshi refers to a group of 47 warriors under the former feudal retainer of Ako, Kuranosuke OISHI, who on January 30, 1703 broke into the residence of Yoshinaka KIRA, from a Koke (honorable family) who were enemies of the former lord <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Naganori ASANO.html">Naganori ASANO</a>, to murder him and get revenge. </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>In Ako City, home of the Gishi Festival, the group is known as Ako Gishi, and pre-war, the name Ako Gishi used to be known nationwide in relation to loyalty and filial piety, but post-war, since Jiro OSARAGI's novel was adapted for TV, the name of Ako Roshi has been more widely known. They is also called Shijushichishi (47 warriors). 
<br/>(Refer to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Genroku Ako Incident.html">Genroku Ako Incident</a> for details of the incident itself.)<br/>
</p>
<p>There is a theory which states they were actually a group of Shijurokushi (46 warriors), not Shijushichishi (47 warriors). Effectively, the issue is whether the foot soldier Kichiemon TERASAKA who suddenly disappeared after a raid on the way to visit Naganori's grave in Sengaku-ji Temple, was a deserter or left his fellow soldiers with their permission for some reason. If one considers him a fugitive, the group becomes Shijurokushi, but if we assume he left to carry out a secret order by Kuranosuke OISHI, they are called Shijushichishi. </p>
<p>Furthermore, people tend to assume that all the roshi were from Ako County in Harima Province, but actually less than half of them including Kuranosuke OISHI were from Ako. The second most common place of birth was Makabe or Kasama. This was because the core vassals of the Asano clan came together during the time of Makabe Domain, Hitachi Province - the first domain formed with a <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Daimyo.html">Daimyo</a> - before its transfer to Ako (its territory spread over Makabe County, Tsukuba County and Nihari County, Ibaraki Prefecture) and the time of Kasama Domain after its territory change and increase in property (its territory stretched to Kasama City, Ibaraki Prefecture and former land of Makabe Domain). Many more senior Roshi such as Chuzaemon YOSHIDA, Junai ONODERA, and Yahe HORIBE were born there. As a result, families with roshi lineage remain in the region even today, and many artifacts left by deceased roshi have been handed down through the generations. </p>
<p>At Sengaku-ji Temple where the Ako Roshi are buried, the Gishi Festival takes place every year on the day of the raid even today (although the precise timing was around midnight of December 14th of Japan's old lunar calendar, the Gishi Festival still takes place on December 14th of the New (solar) calendar). </p>
