<h1>Uijin (初陣)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Uijin is the first battle that young people in the Japanese samurai hierarchy participated in. </p>
<p>Although the ages for uijin varied from person to person, in many cases the participants were in their early teens around genpuku (coming of age ceremony) and the parents were inclined to send them to a battle that they would doubtlessly win, wishing for their safety. Motonari MORI had his uijin at the age of 20, which is an exceptionally late example. </p>
<p><h3>Examples of Uijin</h3>

<p>Motoharu KIKKAWA, aged 13 (1540, Battle of Yoshida Koriyama-jo Castle)<br/>

<p>Having developed a new meaning, the word often means facing something that the person has never experienced before. </p>
