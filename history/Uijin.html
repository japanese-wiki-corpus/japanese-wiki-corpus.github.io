<h1>Uijin (初陣)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Uijin is the first battle that young people in the Japanese <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> hierarchy participated in. </p>
<p>Although the ages for uijin varied from person to person, in many cases the participants were in their early teens around <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Genpuku (celebrate ones coming of age).html">genpuku</a> (coming of age ceremony) and the parents were inclined to send them to a battle that they would doubtlessly win, wishing for their safety. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Motonari MORI.html">Motonari MORI</a> had his uijin at the age of 20, which is an exceptionally late example. </p>
