<h1>Kachi (徒士)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The term Kachi means lower class warriors who fought on foot. According to the modern military system, warriors who are allowed to fight on horseback (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Umamawari (horse guards).html">Umamawari</a> and above) correspond to officers and Kachi correspond to noncommissioned officers. Kachi were categorized into <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shibun.html">shibun</a> (soldiers who had the status of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a>) and strictly distinguished from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ashigaru.html">ashigaru</a> (common warriors) who had not the status of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a>. At the battle field, they fought as the forerunners of their lords and in peaceful time, they served as the guards (Kachi-gumi (Kachi teams)) of castles or engaged in administrative jobs (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Metsuke (a governmental post of the Edo bakufu).html">metsuke</a> (police)) or subordinates of kanjo-bugyo (commissioner of finance) as middle class managers. </p>
<p><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Ieyasu TOKUGAWA.html">Ieyasu TOKUGAWA</a> established nine Kachi-gumi (Kachi team) in 1603 as the organization of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Edo bakufu.html">Edo bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>). Thereafter, the number of persons as well as that of teams was increased. During the period when the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> was stable, there were 20 Kachi teams under Kachigashira (superintendant of Kachi teams) and each team had two kumigashira (head of Kachi team) and 28 Kachi. Kachi were <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Gokenin.html">gokenin</a> (immediate vassals of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>) who were entitled to kuramai (rice preserved in the depository of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>) and their salary was 70 bales, the equivalent of annual rice stipend of five men. Their formal suit was noshime (a kind of kimono)/shiro-katabira (light white hemp garment) and their normal suit was a black crepe <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Haori.html">haori</a> (Japanese half-coat)/<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Hakama (pleated and divided skirt made in fine strips).html">hakama</a> (pleated trousers) with no family crest. Their family status were initially <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Gokenin.html">gokenin</a> (kakaezeki (the lowest rank of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Gokenin.html">gokenin</a>)), but it became fudai (the highest rank of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Gokenin.html">gokenin</a>) in 1862. </p>
