<h1>Jibugyo (地奉行)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Jibugyo was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Bugyo.html">bugyo</a> (magistrate) appointed by the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>) and the Muromachi <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>. He was in charge of administration and trials related to housing and land in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> where the respective <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> was located. He played a role similar to that of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Machi-bugyo (town magistrate).html">machi-bugyo</a> (town magistrate) who was responsible for administration and trials related to housing and land in Edo where the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Edo bakufu.html">Edo bakufu</a> was located. </p>
<p>It is considered that during the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yasutoki HOJO.html">Yasutoki HOJO</a> appointed Jibugyo together with Hobugyonin (person who monitors and polices villains and street traders), a low-level position. Placed under the Samurai-dokoro (the Board of Retainers), they took on the administration and maintenance of public order of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> with the Samurai-dokoro. However, in reality, at least one <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Bugyo.html">bugyo</a> was selected from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Miuchibito (Private Vassals of the Tokuso Family).html">Miuchibito</a> (private vassals of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/family/Tokuso.html">Tokuso</a>, the patrimonial head of the main branch of the Hojo clan), and it is considered that control by the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/family/Tokuso.html">Tokuso</a> and the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Regent.html">regent</a> spread even to the city of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a>. </p>
<p>Jibugyo of the Muromachi <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> was called Jikatatonin (a head of Jikata, a person in charge of trials related to housing and land), and local officials such as Kaigo (assistant administrator) and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yoriudo.html">Yoriudo</a> (staff that worked at <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> organizations) were placed under them. Placed under the jurisdiction of Samurai-dokoro, they took on the administration and maintenance of public order in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> with the Samurai-dokoro. However, in reality, they often clashed with the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kebiishi (police and judicial chief).html">kebiishi</a> (a police and judicial chief) of the Imperial Court because their authorities overlapped. But once the Muromachi <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> took total control of the city of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshimitsu ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshimitsu ASHIKAGA</a>'s day, the post of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kebiishi (police and judicial chief).html">kebiishi</a> was virtually abolished and the authority was granted to jibugyo exclusively. </p>
