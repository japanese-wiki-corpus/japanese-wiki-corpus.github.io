<h1>Ecchu Kubo (a government which existed in Ecchu) (越中公方)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Ecchu Kubo was a government which was established at Hojozu, Imizu county, Ecchu Province by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshitane ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshitane ASHIKAGA</a> who was deposed as the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> of Muromachi <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>) and escaped from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> in 1493. In those days the name Ecchu-gosho Palace was also used. At present, it is sometimes called Hojozu government, Hojozu <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> or Ecchu <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>. </p>
<p><h3>History</h3>
</p>
<p>Yoshiki (another name for Yoshitane) entered Hojozu-jo Castle (at Nakashinminato, Imizu City) of Naganobu JINBO, Ecchu <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shugodai.html">shugodai</a> (deputy of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a>, provincial constable) after escaping from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. Then he entered the Imperial Palace which was made by renovating <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shoko-ji Temple (Kyoto City).html">Shoko-ji Temple</a>. Shoko-ji Temple, which became the Imperial Palace, is considered to mean <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Kosho-ji Temple.html">Kosho-ji Temple</a> which was at Ishimaru (Ishimaru, Takaoka City) next to Hojozu-jo Castle and has now moved to Hon-machi, Imizu City. </p>
<p>Yoshiki issued gohan no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Migyosho.html">migyosho</a> (document of shogunate order with the seal of a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>), <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Gonaisho.html">gonaisho</a> (official document) and bugyonin hosho (document called administrative directive) by commanding bugyonin (magistrate). </p>
<p>In 1499, the activities in Ecchu ended as Yoshitada (the new name of Yoshiki) moved his address to Echizen Province. <h3>Construction</h3>
</p>
<p>Members who made up the government include the following. 
<br/>Hisanobu HATAKEYAMA, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a> of Ecchu Province,<br/>
Yasutaka TOGASHI, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a> of Kaga Province,<br/>
Sadazane UESUGI, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a> of Echigo Province,<br/>
Sadakage ASAKURA (the ninth family head), <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a> of Echizen Province,<br/>
Court nobles to work for <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>, namely a certain Hino, Suetsuna ANO, Tadaaki MATSUDONO and Masayasu ASUKAI,<br/>
Yonban-shu (the fourth group to guard the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>) of Bakufu-Hoko-shu (the shogunal military guard of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>) including Sadayori ISE, Yoshitaka YOSHIMI and Masachika HATAKEYAMA,<br/>
Sakyonosuke KANO, 視元 ISSHIKI<br/>
However, the members varied according to their returning to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> or coming to Ecchu resulting from familiar/unfamiliar relationships with the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Masamoto HOSOKAWA.html">Masamoto HOSOKAWA</a> government in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. </p>
<p>The campaign for Yoshiki's return to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> is considered to have been supported by their own economic base, including <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> jikishin-dan ryosho (territory under the direct control of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>'s direct retainers) and Iwashimizu Hachimangu ryosho (territory under the direct control of Iwashimizu Hachimangu Shrine) which were concentrated near Hojozu. Around the same time, the Jinbo family also further seized territories in Ecchu which were held by temples, shrines, kuge (court nobles), territorial lords and jikishin (direct retainers to the lord) of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>. <h3>Heritage and tradition</h3>
</p>
<p><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Renga.html">Renga</a> (linked-verse) poets and so on including Sogi IO came over in consideration of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshitane ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshitane ASHIKAGA</a>'s stay at Hojozu. Waka anthologies were also sent from kugeshu (court nobles) in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. Kenpon Chakushoku Hokekyo Mandala-zu (owned by Honpo-ji Temple (Toyama City), national important cultural property), Seiji Ukibotanmon Koro (owned by Ashikura-ji Temple Issan-kai, the cultural property designated by Toyama Prefecture) and so on were brought in time for Yoshiki's stay and passed down. Oyama-jinja Shrine Maedate-shadan Honden (national important cultural property, repaired in the middle of the Muromachi period) is also known to have been repaired by Yoshiki. He is known to have stayed in Ogawaji district, Uozu City for two months. The wooden seated statue of Tenjin, which was brought by Yoshiki, is enshrined in Mt. Tenjin in the district. </p>
