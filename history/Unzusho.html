<h1>Unzusho (雲図抄)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Unzusho is a book on rites that was written in the late Heian period. 
<br/>The title of the book literally means 'an instruction for rites of Unjo (in other words, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Seiryoden.html">Seiryoden</a> or the imperial court).'<br/>
It illustrates the arrangements of rites in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Seiryoden.html">Seiryoden</a> with colored pictures. </p>
<p>The author was identified as FUJIWARA no Tomotaka in "Honchoshojaku <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Mokuroku.html">mokuroku</a>" (the oldest list of Japanese books in existence written during the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period). However, in modern times, since Hidematsu WADA presumed that the author had been his elder brother, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Shigetaka.html">FUJIWARA no Shigetaka</a>, and that the year of compilation had been the late 1110's, this presumption has been widely accepted. Nevertheless, during the Edo period, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Toshimasa BOJO.html">Toshimasa BOJO</a>, who was a descendant of FUJIWARA no Tametaka, advanced a new theory that <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Chikataka.html">FUJIWARA no Chikataka</a>, who was a younger brother of aforementioned Shigetaka and Tomotaka, was the author. Since FUJIWARA no Tametaka was a real brother of Shigetaka, Tomotaka and Chikataka, there was a possibility that the history of the book had been handed down in the Bojo family, but the truth remains unclear. </p>
