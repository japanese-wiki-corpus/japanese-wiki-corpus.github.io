<h1>Chokyo-Entoku Wars (長享・延徳の乱)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The Chokyo-Entoku Wars were campaigns conducted by the Muromachi <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>) twice in 1487 and in 1491 in the late Muromachi period against Omi no kuni <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a> (the provincial constable of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Omi Province.html">Omi Province</a>) Takayori ROKKAKU, and it is also referred to as Rokkaku Seibatsu (suppression). In addition, the first campaign was also called Magari no Jin because a position was taken up in Magari, Kurita County, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Omi Province.html">Omi Province</a> (Ritto City, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Shiga Prefecture.html">Shiga Prefecture</a>). </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>After Onin-Bunmei Wars came to an end, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a> (provincial constables) and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kokujin.html">Kokujin</a> (local lords) have extended their power in various places by wresting territories of temples and shrines and so on. Omi <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a> (the Governor of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Omi Province.html">Omi Province</a>) the Rokkaku clan, who had belonged to the West squad led by Sozen (Mochitoyo) YAMANA in Onin-Bunmei Wars, also wrested <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> (private estates) in the province and territories of the trusted vassals of the Shogun Yoshihisa, thereby explicitly showing a rebellious attitude towards the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>). Therefore, the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> intended to recover its dignity and subjugate the Rokkaku clan. </p>
<p>Magari no Jin<br/>
In 1487, the ninth <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshihisa ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshihisa ASHIKAGA</a> decided to subjugate Takayori ROKKAKU, and headed an army mainly consisted of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Hokoshu.html">hokoshu</a> (the shogunal military guard) directly under him to go into the battle in Sakamoto in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Omi Province.html">Omi Province</a>, and in September, the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> ordered the Shogunal Deputy <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Masamoto HOSOKAWA.html">Masamoto HOSOKAWA</a>, Wakasa no kuni <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a> (the provincial constable of Wakasa Province) <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kuninobu TAKEDA.html">Kuninobu TAKEDA</a> and Kaga no kuni <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a> (the provincial constable of Kaga Province) Masachika TOGASHI to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Omi Province.html">Omi Province</a> and attacked Takayori. </p>
<p>Takayori temporarily abandoned <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kannonji-jo Castle.html">Kannonji-jo Castle</a>, and conducted a guerrilla warfare in a mountainous area in Koga County. Yoshihisa himself also went to the front, but the war bemace deadlocked. </p>
<p>The following year, Masachika TOGASHI, on whom the army of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> was depending returned to his hometown due to the Kaga Ikko ikki (an uprising of Ikko sect followers in Kaga Province) intensified, and in addition, an incident occurred in which he was killed in the ikki. Yoshihisa showed his determination to subjugate <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Hongan-ji Temple.html">Hongan-ji Temple</a> and the forces of uprising as well, but he was forced to abandon it because <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Masamoto HOSOKAWA.html">Masamoto HOSOKAWA</a> also disagreed with him for the reason that the suppression of the Rokkaku clan was ongoing. </p>
<p>Sadakage ASAKURA (the ninth family head) who became Echizen no kuni <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a> (the Governor of Echizen Province) and Mino no kuni <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a> (the Governor of Mino Province) Shigeyori TOKI did not move for fear that they would become the next targets, although they had geographically better conditions than Kaga Province to join the camp. </p>
<p>Although Sadakage ASAKURA himself stayed in his province, he dispatched <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kagefuyu ASAKURA.html">Kagefuyu ASAKURA</a> of his family to Sakamoto in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Omi Province.html">Omi Province</a>, thereby showing his minimally cooperative attitude. However, Shigeyori TOKI raised an army in Mino Province, and in addition he stayed in the mountains to intimidate the army of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>. After all, in 1489, Yoshihisa who had changed his name to Yoshihiro died at the front at Magari in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Omi Province.html">Omi Province</a>, and therefore the suppression by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> was suspended and Takayori was temporarily discharged. </p>
<p>The second campaign against the Rokkaku clan<br/>
<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshitane ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshitane ASHIKAGA</a> who succeeded to Yoshihisa also started to suppress Takayori again in 1491. The army of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> abandoned the suppression because Takayori escaped from Koga County to Ise Province. The army of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> withdrew from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Omi Province.html">Omi Province</a>. </p>
<p>Result<br/>
Due to the failure in two campaigns for the suppression, and the Meio Coup in 1493 where <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Masamoto HOSOKAWA.html">Masamoto HOSOKAWA</a> forced the Shogun Yoshiki to abdicate, the authority of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> significantly reduced. The former Shogun Yoshiki, who was rehabilitated, was preoccupied with the activity for reinstatement. </p>
<p>Afterwards, the Kinai region (provinces surrounding <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and Nara) came to be involved in wars (such as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Funaokayama-gassen.html">Funaokayama-gassen</a> [battle of Mt. Funaoka]) originating from a struggle over the position of shogunate. </p>
