<p></p>
<p>Kawachi-Genji is a school of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Seiwa-Genji (Minamoto clan).html">Seiwa-Genji</a> based in Kawachi province<br/>
</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> 'Genji' generally means this school<br/>
When compared with <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Ise-Heishi (Taira clan).html">Ise-Heishi</a> called 'Heike', the name of 'Gen-ke' (the Gen family) was also used in the past. </p>
<p>History<br/>
</p>
<p><h3>Founder of Kawachi-Genji</h3>
</p>
<p><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Yorinobu.html">MINAMOTO no Yorinobu</a>, the third son of MINAMOTO no Mitsunaka, is regarded as the founder who formed the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> group of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Seiwa-Genji (Minamoto clan).html">Seiwa-Genji</a> in Tada, Kawabe-gun, Settsu Province (Tada, Kawanishi City, Hyogo Prefecture). </p>
<p><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Yorinobu.html">MINAMOTO no Yorinobu</a> was based in Tsuboi, Furuichi-gun, Kawachi Province (Currently, Tsuboi, Habikino City, Osaka Prefecture), where he built Koroho castle. They are referred to as 'Kawachi-Genji' because they are based in Kawachi Province. <h3>Periods</h3>
</p>
<p>There are roughly six periods with Kawachi-Genji. </p>
<p>Creation period: <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Appointment (Ninkan).html">Appointment</a> of Kawachi no kami (the governor of Kawachi Province) in the period of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Yorinobu.html">MINAMOTO no Yorinobu</a> ~ Subjugation of Zen Kunen no Eki (Former Nine-Years' Campaign) in the period of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Yoriyoshi.html">MINAMOTO no Yoriyoshi</a>. Declining period: After the Go Sannen no Eki (Later Three Years' Campaign) in the period of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Yoshiie.html">MINAMOTO no Yoshiie</a> ~ <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Rebellion by MINAMOTO no Yoshichika.html">Rebellion by MINAMOTO no Yoshichika</a>, an elder brother of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Yoshitada.html">MINAMOTO no Yoshitada</a> in the period of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Yoshitada.html">MINAMOTO no Yoshitada</a>. Fall period: Assassination of Yoshitada in the period of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Yoshitada.html">MINAMOTO no Yoshitada</a> ~ Loss of the Heiji War in the period of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Yoshitomo.html">MINAMOTO no Yoshitomo</a>. 
<br/>Resuscitation period: Establishment of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (feudal government headed by a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>) in the period of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Yoritomo.html">MINAMOTO no Yoritomo</a> ~ Death of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Yoritomo.html">MINAMOTO no Yoritomo</a> in the period of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Yoritomo.html">MINAMOTO no Yoritomo</a><br/>
Collapse period: Yoriie's assumption of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> in the period of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Yoriie.html">MINAMOTO no Yoriie</a> ~ Assassination of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Sanetomo.html">MINAMOTO no Sanetomo</a> in the period of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Sanetomo.html">MINAMOTO no Sanetomo</a>. </p>
<p>However, some strict historians think that Kawachi-based Kawachi-Genji began with <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Yorinobu.html">MINAMOTO no Yorinobu</a> and ended with <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Yoshitada.html">MINAMOTO no Yoshitada</a> or <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Tameyoshi.html">MINAMOTO no Tameyoshi</a>. The reason is that <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Tameyoshi.html">MINAMOTO no Tameyoshi</a> was entirely in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and left no evidence of his presence in the manor of Kawachi Province. Further, since MINOMOTO no Yoshitomo moved to Togoku (the eastern region of Japan) and was active in such provinces as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a>, Kazusa, and Shimousa as his stronghold for a long time, and later, he kept staying in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and had little connection with the manor of Kawachi Province. Therefore, the period of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Tameyoshi.html">MINAMOTO no Tameyoshi</a> and that of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Yoshitomo.html">MINAMOTO no Yoshitomo</a> are sometimes called 'Zaikyo-Genji' (Genji staying in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>) and 'Bando-Genji (Genji staying in the old Kanto region) respectively. Questions are raised on calling them 'Kawachi-Genji' despite the fact that they were no longer based on the manor of Kawachi Province, and it is, indeed, unreasonable that those who were apparently never based in Kawachi according to historical materials, such as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Yoritomo.html">MINAMOTO no Yoritomo</a>, are included in Kawachi-Genji. </p>
<p>On the other hand, the alternative view is that Ishikawa-Genji, the descendants of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Yoshitoki.html">MINAMOTO no Yoshitoki</a>, sixth (or fifth) son of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Yoshiie.html">MINAMOTO no Yoshiie</a>, that inherited the main domain of Genji in Kawachi Province is the Kawachi-Genji thereafter. Some even think that Ishikawa-Genji is the mainstream of Kawachi-Genji that can be traced back to HACHIMANTARO Yoshiie (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Yoshiie.html">MINAMOTO no Yoshiie</a>) ('Residential' viewpoint that Kawachi-Genji is those who were Kawachi-based). However, taking consideration of the 'lineage of the family leader', Ishikawa-Genji is just a descendant of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Yoshitoki.html">MINAMOTO no Yoshitoki</a> even though Ishikawawa-Genji inherited Ishikawa manor, the main domain of Kawachi-Genji, and they remained to be a local <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> group, it can be said that the Ishikawa-Genji and its descendant, Ishikawa clan, who protected the inherited main domain on a reduced scale, is one of local Genji descended from Kawachi-Genji, but it is arguable whether it deserves the name of Kawachi-Genji. </p>
<p>Also, from the viewpoint that the name of Kawachi-Genji refers not to the base but to the family lineage, it is acceptable to call those who are descendants of Kawachi-Genji even though they were not Kawachi-based ('Genealogical' viewpoint). However, if that is the case, it is contradictory to see the death of Sanetomo as the collapse of Kawachi-Genji as written in this section, because Ashikaga clan continued after the death of Sanetomo and established the Muromachi <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (feudal government headed by a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>) according to the genealogical viewpoint. <h3>Rise and fall</h3>
</p>
<p><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Yorinobu.html">MINAMOTO no Yorinobu</a>, the founder of Kawachi-Genji, subjugated the TAIRA no Tadatsune War and established the influence in Bando (old Kanto region). His son, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Yoriyoshi.html">MINAMOTO no Yoriyoshi</a> and yoriyoshi's son <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Yoshiie.html">MINAMOTO no Yoshiie</a> gained control of Bando <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> in Zen Kunen no Eki and Go Sannen no Eki, and HACHIMANTARO Yoshiie became the head of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> families. Yorinobu, Yoriyoshi and Yoshiie are also called three generations of Kawachi-Genji. </p>
<p>Unlike the Kyoto-based Settsu-Genji, Kawachi-Genji moved to Bando. The reason is said that Yorinobu avoided territorial competition with his elder brother, Yorimitsu (Settsu-Genji). </p>
<p>However, in Yoshiie's later years, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Yoshichika.html">MINAMOTO no Yoshichika</a>, his second son, defied Chotei (the Imperial Court), which put Yoshiie in a difficult position, and then, Kawachi-Genji started to weaken. The military renown of Kawachi-Genji was deteriorated by the assassination of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Yoshitada.html">MINAMOTO no Yoshitada</a>, the fourth son of Yoshiie, who took over as the head of the family and enjoyed his fame after the death of Yoshiie, under/in the plot by his uncle <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Yoshimitsu.html">MINAMOTO no Yoshimitsu</a>. At first, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Yoshitsuna.html">MINAMOTO no Yoshitsuna</a>, the second younger brother of Yoshiie, was considered to be the main culprit, and was annihilated in the punitive expedition by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Tameyoshi.html">MINAMOTO no Tameyoshi</a>, the adopted son of Yoshitada (the fifth son of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Yoshichika.html">MINAMOTO no Yoshichika</a>), and after the incident, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Yoshimitsu.html">MINAMOTO no Yoshimitsu</a>, another younger brother (the third younger brother) was found to be the real culprit, which made internal troubles and decline of Genji more apparent and its power was lost for a while. <h3>Hogen/Heji War</h3>
</p>
<p>After the death of Yoshiie followed by the assassination of Yoshitada, Hogen War broke out in the period of Tameyoshi who succeeded Kawachi-Genji, and the clan was divided against itself. Tameyoshi, who fought on the side of the retired Emperor, was executed after the War and his son, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Tametomo.html">MINAMOTO no Tametomo</a> was banished. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Yoshitomo.html">MINAMOTO no Yoshitomo</a>, who fought on the side of the Emperor, was the only survivor and the family power waned. </p>
<p>Yoshitomo, based in Bando not in Kawachi Province that was the stronghold of Kawachi-Genji, started the Heiji War in a bid to regain power. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">Samurai</a> warriors including Yoshitomo's heir, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Yoshihira.html">MINAMOTO no Yoshihira</a> fought bravely and distinguished themselves in the War, but there was not time to mobilize followers in Bando, and therefore they remained to be a small number of warriors and was finally defeated by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Ise-Heishi (Taira clan).html">Ise-Heishi</a> (Taira clan) led by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/TAIRA no Kiyomori.html">TAIRA no Kiyomori</a>. Yoshitomo was killed at Chita while he was fleeing to Togoku. Yoshihira in disguise sneaked into <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> which was ruled by the family of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/TAIRA no Kiyomori.html">TAIRA no Kiyomori</a> (Taira clan) and tried to assassinate Kiyomori with the help of the former followers of his father Yoshitomo hidden in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, but he failed, and was captured and killed. Yoritomo, a younger brother of Yoshihira, was banished to Izu, and Kawachi-Genji was scattered in all directions. <h3><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Yorimasa.html">MINAMOTO no Yorimasa</a> of Settsu-Genji and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Yoritomo.html">MINAMOTO no Yoritomo</a> of Kawachi-Genji</h3>
</p>
<p>In the Heiji War, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Yorimasa.html">MINAMOTO no Yorimasa</a> of Settsu-Genji acted independently from <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Yoshitomo.html">MINAMOTO no Yoshitomo</a> and fought against Yoshihira, a son of Yoshitomo and as a result, contributed the victory of Heike<br/>
</p>
<p><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Yoritomo.html">MINAMOTO no Yoritomo</a>, who became the head of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> families as the first <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Seii Taishogun.html">Seii Taishogun</a> (commander-in-chief of the expeditionary force against the barbarians, great, unifying leader) of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> later, was Kawachi-Genji, therefore, the head of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> families was chosen from Kawachi-Genji both in name and reality afterwards. Yorimasa and top family members died in battle when <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Prince Mochihito.html">Prince Mochihito</a> raised an army. 
<br/>Survivors of the family such as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Aritsuna.html">MINAMOTO no Aritsuna</a> (in Izu Province at the time of the battle) and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Hirotsuna.html">MINAMOTO no Hirotsuna</a> continued the family line of Settsu-Genji from <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Yorimitsu.html">MINAMOTO no Yorimitsu</a>, but they were, compared with Yoritomo who established the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>, only <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Gokenin.html">gokenin</a> (immediate vassals of the shogunate)<br/>
<h3>Descendants of Kawachi-Genji</h3>
</p>
<p>In later times, 'Genji' of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> family and its descendants refers to Kawachi-Genji in most cases<br/>
Later, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Yoritomo.html">MINAMOTO no Yoritomo</a>, a son of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Yoshitomo.html">MINAMOTO no Yoshitomo</a>, raised an army and beat Heike (the family of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/TAIRA no Kiyomori.html">TAIRA no Kiyomori</a> of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Ise-Heishi (Taira clan).html">Ise-Heishi</a>), and established the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> ruled by the Gen family. <h3>Lineage of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Yoriyoshi.html">MINAMOTO no Yoriyoshi</a></h3>
