<p></p>
<p>In the Eiroku Incident, troops led by the so-called "Miyoshi Triumvirate" (Nagayuki MIYOSHI, Masayasu MIYOSHI and Tomomichi IWANARI) and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Hisahide MATSUNAGA.html">Hisahide MATSUNAGA</a> attacked and killed <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshiteru ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshiteru ASHIKAGA</a>, the 13th <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Seii Taishogun.html">Seii Taishogun</a> (literally, "great general who subdues the barbarians") of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Muromachi Bakufu.html">Muromachi Bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>), at the then Imperial Palace in Nijo, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> on <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Eiroku.html">Eiroku</a> 8, the 19th day of the 5th month (according to the old calendar) (June 17, 1565). </p>
<p>Outline<br/>
The years given in parentheses are according to the Julian calendar and, unless the context clearly indicates that the Christian calendar is being used, every month and day is based on the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Senmyo (an Imperial Edict).html">Senmyo</a> calendar, a traditional Japanese calendar used to cover ancient history. </p>
<p>Appointed to the hereditary position of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugodai.html">Shugodai</a> (delegate or military governor of a province) of Awa Province, the Miyoshi clan steadily expanded its presence while <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Nagayoshi MIYOSHI.html">Nagayoshi MIYOSHI</a> was head of the family, while opposing the Ashikaga <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> and his deputy from the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/family/Hosokawa clan.html">Hosokawa clan</a>. Of special note is that in 1553, the Miyoshi clan expelled Shogun Yoshiteru to Kuchiki, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Omi Province.html">Omi Province</a>, and reached the zenith of its power as the virtual ruler of the areas surrounding the capital. However, during the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Sengoku Period (period of warring states) (Japan).html">Sengoku Period</a> (Period of Warring States), it was difficult to maintain rule over <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> in opposition to the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> without relying on the governing mechanism of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>. Furthermore, after Yoshiteru had moved his base to Kuchiki, Omi, the Miyoshi clan was intermittently attacked by the Rokkaku clan and the Hatakeyama clan, and found it difficult to stabilize its rule over <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. Finally in 1558, attacked by the troops of Shogun Yoshiteru and Yoshikata ROKKAKU, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a> of Omi, Nagayoshi was forced into a rapprochement, and joined the Bakufu Goshobanshu (private guards of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a>). </p>
<p>However, this development not only prevented the Miyoshi clan from ruling <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> but also reduced its status to a mere element of the governing mechanism of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> as a subject of Yoshiteru. Furthermore, roughly from that time on, influential members of the family including Kazumasa SOGO, Yoshikata MIYOSHI and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshioki MIYOSHI.html">Yoshioki MIYOSHI</a>, eldest son and prospective heir of Nagayoshi, died one after another and, in the end, Nagayoshi even assassinated for himself Fuyuyasu ATAGI, his younger brother who had supported Nagayoshi the entire time. In 1564, Nagayoshi himself died, yet another omen to the decline of the Miyoshi clan. Yoshiteru, on the other hand, tried to restore the authority of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">Bakufu</a> by mediating among warring lords throughout the country and appointing some of them to honorable offices in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">Bakufu</a>. In the same year of 1564, Yoshiteru utilized the Miyoshi clan in driving <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Sadataka ISE.html">Sadataka ISE</a>, then head of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Mandokoro.html">Mandokoro</a> (the government administrative office) who had been hostile to the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a>, into death in a losing battle; appointed his (Yoshiteru's) cousin-in-law Harukado SETTSU as new head of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Mandokoro.html">Mandokoro</a>; strengthened his control of official decisions of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">Bakufu</a> through the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Mandokoro.html">Mandokoro</a>, previously out of his real authority but now more at his mercy, and thereby steadily achieved direct rule by the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> as the wisest leader after <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshimitsu ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshimitsu ASHIKAGA</a>. However, these initiatives by Yoshiteru also induced the Miyoshi clan to entertain strong suspicion against him to a critical level. This sense of crisis drove <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Hisahide MATSUNAGA.html">Hisahide MATSUNAGA</a>, who had control of the Miyoshi family in place of legitimate heir <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshitsugu MIYOSHI.html">Yoshitsugu MIYOSHI</a>, and the three men of the Miyoshi family into ousting of Yoshiteru, namely assassination of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a>. </p>
<p>About 8 a.m., June 27, 1565, the troops led by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Hisahide MATSUNAGA.html">Hisahide MATSUNAGA</a> and the three men of the Miyoshi family, intending to oust Yoshiteru and helping Yoshiteru's cousin <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshihide ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshihide ASHIKAGA</a> to win the position of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a>, besieged and attacked the Imperial Palace in Nijo, where Yoshiteru lived. Yoshiteru and his aides had prepared against the Miyoshi troops' raid by repairing the palace building in advance, but were overwhelmed by superior numbers. Although they fought the Miyoshi troops well despite heavy odds, Yoshiteru died in battle by noon, and his real mother <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Keijuin.html">Keijuin</a> (a daughter of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Hisamichi KONOE.html">Hisamichi KONOE</a> and legitimate wife of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshiharu ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshiharu ASHIKAGA</a>, the 12th <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a>) killed herself, following her son to the grave. This assassination of the incumbent <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> heavily ruined the authority of the Shogunate. The desperate and fierce fight by Yoshiteru, a disciple of master swordsman Bokuden TSUKAHARA, has been spoken of for many generations. </p>
<p>A major factor to be considered in discussing this incident as the attempt by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshiteru ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshiteru ASHIKAGA</a> to strengthen the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">Bakufu</a>'s authority is his perceived sense of distance from the Miyoshi family. As is symbolized by the cited victory over <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Sadataka ISE.html">Sadataka ISE</a>, recovery of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">Bakufu</a>'s power in the age of Yoshiteru, who had no real military force (recovery of power not as a mediator of inter-daimyo (feudal lord) strifes who would need only letters and messengers but as the ruler of the areas surrounding the capital whose position was supported by military force) was virtually supported by the conciliatory posture of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Nagayoshi MIYOSHI.html">Nagayoshi MIYOSHI</a> toward the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">Bakufu</a>. </p>
<p>However, Yoshiteru made many attempts to assassinate Nagayoshi, including some in this period, and this fact strongly suggests that he did not realize such attempts would rather undermine the basis of his power than strengthen it. Ousting of Shogun Yoshiteru, not even proposed by Miyoshi and Matsunaga initially, but was first masterminded by Mochitaka HOSOKAWA, governor of Awa Province, in a rather early year and, as this fact reveals, Yoshiteru who had insisted on real power and despotism by the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a>, had been shunned by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">Bakufu</a> bureaucrats since the beginning. </p>
<p>Unable to foresee the consequences of the ousting of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Nagayoshi MIYOSHI.html">Nagayoshi MIYOSHI</a> who, although firmly insistent on his own interests, had never deviated from the posture of respecting the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun family.html">Shogun family</a>, Yoshiteru happened to learn from the soon succumbing of Nagayo<br/>
</p>
<p><h3>Aftermath</h3>
</p>
<p>Immediately after the assassination of Yoshiteru, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Hisahide MATSUNAGA.html">Hisahide MATSUNAGA</a> and his fellow conspirators imprisoned Kakukei, Yoshiteru's younger brother, of Ichijoin of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Kofuku-ji Temple.html">Kofuku-ji Temple</a> in Nara. However, two months later on July 28 (old calendar), Kakukei was relieved from the imprisonment by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yusai HOSOKAWA.html">Yusai HOSOKAWA</a>, a close subject of Yoshiteru, and his party. In February the next year (old calendar), Kakukei returned to secular life, renamed himself Yoshiaki (one of the Chinese characters of the name was later changed to another of the same sound) ASHIKAGA and, traveling via Yajima, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Omi Province.html">Omi Province</a> (today's Moriyama City, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Shiga Prefecture.html">Shiga Prefecture</a>), sought the protection of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshikage ASAKURA.html">Yoshikage ASAKURA</a>, Governor of Echizen Province. </p>
<p>Meanwhile the three men of the Miyoshi family attempted to bring Yoshichika ASHIKAGA (later <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshihide ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshihide ASHIKAGA</a>), a cousin of Yoshiteru, to the Shogunate in Awaji Province, and entered Tonda (Takatsuki City), Settsu Province (today's Takatsuki City, Osaka Prefecture). <h3>Setting Nanto on fire (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Sengoku Period (period of warring states) (Japan).html">Sengoku Period</a>)</h3>
</p>
<p>The three men of the Miyoshi family, while conspiring to bring Yoshihide to the Shogunate, came to oppose <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Hisahide MATSUNAGA.html">Hisahide MATSUNAGA</a>, who had gained hold of the administration of the Miyoshi clan after the death of former lord <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Nagayoshi MIYOSHI.html">Nagayoshi MIYOSHI</a>, and attempted to oust Hisahide under the nominal leadership of incumbent lord <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshitsugu MIYOSHI.html">Yoshitsugu MIYOSHI</a>. </p>
<p>By then, Hisahide had appointed himself the Governor of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Yamato Province.html">Yamato Province</a> by virtue of physical force, and been trying to place the province under his rule. Originally, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Kofuku-ji Temple.html">Kofuku-ji Temple</a> had virtual governorship over <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Yamato Province.html">Yamato Province</a>, and its monk general Junsho TSUTSUI had become a virtual warring lord and ruled <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Yamato.html">Yamato</a>; however, when Junsho died, taking the advantage of the infancy of his heir Junkei TSUTSUI, Hisahide invaded <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Yamato.html">Yamato</a> in 1559 at the instruction of Nagayoshi, and deprived the Tsutsui clan of its estate and the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Kofuku-ji Temple.html">Kofuku-ji Temple</a> of its governorship. The three men proposed to Junkei and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Kofuku-ji Temple.html">Kofuku-ji Temple</a>, both displeased with this development, to attack Hisahide and entered into a clandestine alliance with them. </p>
<p>As the escape of Kakukei from <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Kofuku-ji Temple.html">Kofuku-ji Temple</a> to Echizen became known, the three men blamed Governor Hisahide's for his oversight, while Hisahide, agitating Yoshitsugu, incumbent head of the Miyoshi clan, who had come to oppose the three men, on his part planned to subjugate the three men. </p>
<p>Thus on December 21 (old calendar), the three men's troops began to invade <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Yamato.html">Yamato</a> and, together with Junkei TSUTSUI, sieged Tamonyama-jo Castle (in today's Horen-cho, Nara City), where Hisahide had his headquarters. However, as Tamonyama-jo Castle was a solid fortress and the troops of Matsunaga were high in morale, the battle fell into a two-year stalemate, accompanied by minor collisions here and there in the areas surrounding the capital and followed by a gradual calming-off process. </p>
<p>However, Yoshitsugu who had been detained by the three men of the Miyoshi family during this battle, in March and April 1567, escaped from the three men and made peace with <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Hisahide MATSUNAGA.html">Hisahide MATSUNAGA</a>, with whom he formed a joint front against the three men. To wage an all-out counter-offensive to this move, the three men sent troops to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Yamato.html">Yamato</a> in May and June. MATSUNAGA's troops reentered Tamonyama-jo Castle, and the three men and Tsutsui's joint legion encamped on the Mt. Daijoin behind Daijoin of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Kofuku-ji Temple.html">Kofuku-ji Temple</a>. After some time, they came downhill and moved their headquarters to the main hall of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Todai-ji Temple.html">Todai-ji Temple</a>, from where they attacked Tamonyama-jo Castle. As both sides set various places around on fire during their attack on the opponents, some sub-buildings of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Todai-ji Temple.html">Todai-ji Temple</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Kofuku-ji Temple.html">Kofuku-ji Temple</a>, together with <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Hannya-ji Temple.html">Hannya-ji Temple</a>, were burnt one after another. On September 6, Kaidan-in, the Buddhist ordination platform of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Todai-ji Temple.html">Todai-ji Temple</a>, was burnt, and the Matsunaga troops encamped on its ruins. This meant an abnormal state in which the two hostile camps took up their respective positions within the premises of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Todai-ji Temple.html">Todai-ji Temple</a>, a great prestigious temple since the Nara period, and confronted each other. </p>
<p>And on November 10, 1567, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Hisahide MATSUNAGA.html">Hisahide MATSUNAGA</a> staged an all-out attack on the joint troops of the three men and Tsutsui entrenching themselves in the hall housing the great statue of Buddha. The hall was set on fire some time between midnight and 2 a.m., and the whole premises of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Todai-ji Temple.html">Todai-ji Temple</a> became a battlefield. Although the troops of the three men and Tsutsui retreated in the meantime, warfare continued in various places in the areas surrounding the capital, including <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Yamato Province.html">Yamato Province</a>. However, as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Nobunaga ODA.html">Nobunaga ODA</a> backing up <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshiaki ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshiaki ASHIKAGA</a> proceeded to the capital in October 1568, the Eiroku Incident and the ensuing turmoil ended. </p>
<p>The surviving buildings of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Todai-ji Temple.html">Todai-ji Temple</a> included Nigatsudo, Hokkedo, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Shosoin.html">Shosoin</a>, Nandaimon (literally "southern big gate"), <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Shoro (a tower housing a big Buddhist bell).html">Shoro</a> (bell tower), Tengaimon (literally "the gate of shifting the evil") and Nenbutsudo (Buddha invocation hall); although the extent of destruction was smaller than in the burning of Nato by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/TAIRA no Shigehira.html">TAIRA no Shigehira</a> during the Taira-Minamoto War, the very fact that <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Todai-ji Temple.html">Todai-ji Temple</a> itself became a battlefield unlike in the past incident, in which the temple had caught fire from next door, and Daibutsu-den (the Great Buddha hall) itself was set fire shocked people both in and out of the area. Furthermore, the head of Rushanabutsu (the great statue of Buddha) damaged during this fire fell off on a later day, and was left as it was with no budget for repair; it was not until the Jokyo to Genroku years, more than 120 years afterwards, that both the statue itself and its hall were reconstructed. <h3>Issue of Shogunate succession</h3>
</p>
<p>As stated above, the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> was suddenly killed, and the supreme position in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Muromachi Bakufu.html">Muromachi Bakufu</a> was left vacant. In the Kakitsu Incident in which <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshinori ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshinori ASHIKAGA</a> was assassinated, his deputy and other officials held consultations and immediately selected the succeeding <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a>, but, since Deputy <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Ujitsuna HOSOKAWA.html">Ujitsuna HOSOKAWA</a> had died in 1563 before the Eiroku Incident, the position of deputy was unfilled, allowing the functions of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">Bakufu</a> to be virtually halted by the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a>'s death. Furthermore, the Miyoshi and Matsunaga clans ruling <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/family/Asakura clan.html">Asakura clan</a>, an influential governor in the outskirts of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, backed up different persons for inheritance of the Shogunate. </p>
<p>This situation placed the Imperial Court in agony. In April and May 1566, the Court appointed Yoshiaki Samanokami (the head of the section taking care of imperial horses) with a court rank of Jugoinoge (Junior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade) at the recommendation of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Kanemigi YOSHIDA.html">Kanemigi YOSHIDA</a>. The position at the head of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Meryo (Bureau of Horses).html">Meryo</a> (the imperial horse caring section) dates back to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Seiwa-Genji (Minamoto clan).html">Seiwa-Genji</a> (Minamoto clan), and was often held by a supposed heir to the Shogunate. Alarmed by this <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Appointment (Ninkan).html">appointment</a>, Yoshihide attempted a rollback, and early in the following year was appointed to the same status, Samanokami with a rank of Jugoinoge. Now, two candidates came to vie for the Shogunate. </p>
<p>Respectively supported by the Miyoshi and Asakura clans, Yoshihide and Yoshiaki were expected soon to proceed to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> to be proclaimed as the new <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a>. However, the Miyoshi clan was plagued by the continued internal strife between the three men and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Hisahide MATSUNAGA.html">Hisahide MATSUNAGA</a>, while the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/family/Asakura clan.html">Asakura clan</a> was preoccupied with fighting <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Ikko Ikki.html">Ikko Ikki</a> (mobbing by mainly peasants faithful to the Ikko sect of Buddhism), both unable to think about sending their <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> candidates to the capital. </p>
<p>Then, the Imperial Court demanded, as an initial measure, the two candidates for Shogunate to donate 10,000 hiki (100 kan) of money as a prerequisite for the requested <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Appointment (Ninkan).html">appointment</a>. Yoshihide was the first to comply with this demand. Yoshihide succeeded in not only bargaining down the donation of 10,000 hiki to a half but also winning proclamation as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> at Settsu-Tonda in March and April 1568. However, the situation in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> was unstable, and Yoshihide had to postpone his entrance into the capital. Yoshiaki, on the other hand, won the support of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Nobunaga ODA.html">Nobunaga ODA</a> of Owari Province in his procession to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> in October of the same year, and the Imperial Court, dismissing Yoshihide at Tonda, replaced him with Yoshiaki as the new <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a>. Yoshihide fled to Awa Province, but died of illness soon afterwards. </p>
<p>Yoshiaki demanded punishment of those who had tried to have Yoshiteru proclaimed as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a>; <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Sakihisa KONOE.html">Sakihisa KONOE</a>, (Chief Advisor to the Emperor) and Nagasuke TAKAKURA, Councilor, fled to Ishiyamahongan-ji Temple to take refuge, Gon <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Chunagon.html">chunagon</a> (Deputy Middle Level Councilor) Haremigi KAJUJI shut up himself in his house as an expression of repentance, and Councilor Chikauji MINASE accompanied Yoshihide in his exile to Awa. While the opposition between the Yoshiaki-Nobunaga pair and the Sakihisa-Ishiyama <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Hongan-ji Temple.html">Hongan-ji Temple</a> alliance proved to make up a cause of subsequent Genki heiran (the Genki Disturbance), Yoshiaki whose relationship with Nobunaga worsened in the process of warfare made peace with <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Hongan-ji Temple.html">Hongan-ji Temple</a> to form an Anti-Nobunaga alliance (so-called Nobunaga encircling net), which eventually was defeated by Nobunaga, and the Muromachi <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> collapsed. </p>

<p>In the Eiroku Incident, troops led by the so-called &quot;Miyoshi Triumvirate&quot; (Nagayuki MIYOSHI, Masayasu MIYOSHI and Tomomichi IWANARI) and <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Hisahide MATSUNAGA.html&quot;>Hisahide MATSUNAGA</a> attacked and killed <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshiteru ASHIKAGA.html&quot;>Yoshiteru ASHIKAGA</a>, the 13th <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Seii Taishogun.html&quot;>Seii Taishogun</a> (literally, &quot;great general who subdues the barbarians&quot;) of the <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Muromachi Bakufu.html&quot;>Muromachi Bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html&quot;>shogun</a>), at the then Imperial Palace in Nijo, <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html&quot;>Kyoto</a> on <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Eiroku.html&quot;>Eiroku</a> 8, the 19th day of the 5th month (according to the old calendar) (June 17, 1565). </p>

The years given in parentheses are according to the Julian calendar and, unless the context clearly indicates that the Christian calendar is being used, every month and day is based on the <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Senmyo (an Imperial Edict).html&quot;>Senmyo</a> calendar, a traditional Japanese calendar used to cover ancient history. </p>
<p>Appointed to the hereditary position of <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugodai.html&quot;>Shugodai</a> (delegate or military governor of a province) of Awa Province, the Miyoshi clan steadily expanded its presence while <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Nagayoshi MIYOSHI.html&quot;>Nagayoshi MIYOSHI</a> was head of the family, while opposing the Ashikaga <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html&quot;>Shogun</a> and his deputy from the <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/family/Hosokawa clan.html&quot;>Hosokawa clan</a>. Of special note is that in 1553, the Miyoshi clan expelled Shogun Yoshiteru to Kuchiki, <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Omi Province.html&quot;>Omi Province</a>, and reached the zenith of its power as the virtual ruler of the areas surrounding the capital. However, during the <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Sengoku Period (period of warring states) (Japan).html&quot;>Sengoku Period</a> (Period of Warring States), it was difficult to maintain rule over <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html&quot;>Kyoto</a> in opposition to the <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html&quot;>Shogun</a> without relying on the governing mechanism of the <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html&quot;>bakufu</a>. Furthermore, after Yoshiteru had moved his base to Kuchiki, Omi, the Miyoshi clan was intermittently attacked by the Rokkaku clan and the Hatakeyama clan, and found it difficult to stabilize its rule over <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html&quot;>Kyoto</a>. Finally in 1558, attacked by the troops of Shogun Yoshiteru and Yoshikata ROKKAKU, <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html&quot;>Shugo</a> of Omi, Nagayoshi was forced into a rapprochement, and joined the Bakufu Goshobanshu (private guards of the <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html&quot;>Shogun</a>). </p>
<p>However, this development not only prevented the Miyoshi clan from ruling <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html&quot;>Kyoto</a> but also reduced its status to a mere element of the governing mechanism of the <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html&quot;>bakufu</a> as a subject of Yoshiteru. Furthermore, roughly from that time on, influential members of the family including Kazumasa SOGO, Yoshikata MIYOSHI and <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshioki MIYOSHI.html&quot;>Yoshioki MIYOSHI</a>, eldest son and prospective heir of Nagayoshi, died one after another and, in the end, Nagayoshi even assassinated for himself Fuyuyasu ATAGI, his younger brother who had supported Nagayoshi the entire time. In 1564, Nagayoshi himself died, yet another omen to the decline of the Miyoshi clan. Yoshiteru, on the other hand, tried to restore the authority of the <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html&quot;>Bakufu</a> by mediating among warring lords throughout the country and appointing some of them to honorable offices in the <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html&quot;>Bakufu</a>. In the same year of 1564, Yoshiteru utilized the Miyoshi clan in driving <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Sadataka ISE.html&quot;>Sadataka ISE</a>, then head of <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Mandokoro.html&quot;>Mandokoro</a> (the government administrative office) who had been hostile to the <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html&quot;>Shogun</a>, into death in a losing battle; appointed his (Yoshiteru's) cousin-in-law Harukado SETTSU as new head of <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Mandokoro.html&quot;>Mandokoro</a>; strengthened his control of official decisions of the <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html&quot;>Bakufu</a> through the <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Mandokoro.html&quot;>Mandokoro</a>, previously out of his real authority but now more at his mercy, and thereby steadily achieved direct rule by the <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html&quot;>Shogun</a> as the wisest leader after <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshimitsu ASHIKAGA.html&quot;>Yoshimitsu ASHIKAGA</a>. However, these initiatives by Yoshiteru also induced the Miyoshi clan to entertain strong suspicion against him to a critical level. This sense of crisis drove <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Hisahide MATSUNAGA.html&quot;>Hisahide MATSUNAGA</a>, who had control of the Miyoshi family in place of legitimate heir <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshitsugu MIYOSHI.html&quot;>Yoshitsugu MIYOSHI</a>, and the three men of the Miyoshi family into ousting of Yoshiteru, namely assassination of the <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html&quot;>Shogun</a>. </p>
<p>About 8 a.m., June 27, 1565, the troops led by <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Hisahide MATSUNAGA.html&quot;>Hisahide MATSUNAGA</a> and the three men of the Miyoshi family, intending to oust Yoshiteru and helping Yoshiteru's cousin <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshihide ASHIKAGA.html&quot;>Yoshihide ASHIKAGA</a> to win the position of <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html&quot;>Shogun</a>, besieged and attacked the Imperial Palace in Nijo, where Yoshiteru lived. Yoshiteru and his aides had prepared against the Miyoshi troops' raid by repairing the palace building in advance, but were overwhelmed by superior numbers. Although they fought the Miyoshi troops well despite heavy odds, Yoshiteru died in battle by noon, and his real mother <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Keijuin.html&quot;>Keijuin</a> (a daughter of <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Hisamichi KONOE.html&quot;>Hisamichi KONOE</a> and legitimate wife of <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshiharu ASHIKAGA.html&quot;>Yoshiharu ASHIKAGA</a>, the 12th <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html&quot;>Shogun</a>) killed herself, following her son to the grave. This assassination of the incumbent <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html&quot;>Shogun</a> heavily ruined the authority of the Shogunate. The desperate and fierce fight by Yoshiteru, a disciple of master swordsman Bokuden TSUKAHARA, has been spoken of for many generations. </p>
<p>A major factor to be considered in discussing this incident as the attempt by <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshiteru ASHIKAGA.html&quot;>Yoshiteru ASHIKAGA</a> to strengthen the <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html&quot;>Bakufu</a>'s authority is his perceived sense of distance from the Miyoshi family. As is symbolized by the cited victory over <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Sadataka ISE.html&quot;>Sadataka ISE</a>, recovery of the <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html&quot;>Bakufu</a>'s power in the age of Yoshiteru, who had no real military force (recovery of power not as a mediator of inter-daimyo (feudal lord) strifes who would need only letters and messengers but as the ruler of the areas surrounding the capital whose position was supported by military force) was virtually supported by the conciliatory posture of <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Nagayoshi MIYOSHI.html&quot;>Nagayoshi MIYOSHI</a> toward the <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html&quot;>Bakufu</a>. </p>
<p>However, Yoshiteru made many attempts to assassinate Nagayoshi, including some in this period, and this fact strongly suggests that he did not realize such attempts would rather undermine the basis of his power than strengthen it. Ousting of Shogun Yoshiteru, not even proposed by Miyoshi and Matsunaga initially, but was first masterminded by Mochitaka HOSOKAWA, governor of Awa Province, in a rather early year and, as this fact reveals, Yoshiteru who had insisted on real power and despotism by the <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html&quot;>Shogun</a>, had been shunned by <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html&quot;>Bakufu</a> bureaucrats since the beginning. </p>
<p>Unable to foresee the consequences of the ousting of <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Nagayoshi MIYOSHI.html&quot;>Nagayoshi MIYOSHI</a> who, although firmly insistent on his own interests, had never deviated from the posture of respecting the <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun family.html&quot;>Shogun family</a>, Yoshiteru happened to learn from the soon succumbing of Nagayo<br/>
</p>
<p><h3>Aftermath</h3>
</p>
<p>Immediately after the assassination of Yoshiteru, <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Hisahide MATSUNAGA.html&quot;>Hisahide MATSUNAGA</a> and his fellow conspirators imprisoned Kakukei, Yoshiteru's younger brother, of Ichijoin of <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Kofuku-ji Temple.html&quot;>Kofuku-ji Temple</a> in Nara. However, two months later on July 28 (old calendar), Kakukei was relieved from the imprisonment by <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yusai HOSOKAWA.html&quot;>Yusai HOSOKAWA</a>, a close subject of Yoshiteru, and his party. In February the next year (old calendar), Kakukei returned to secular life, renamed himself Yoshiaki (one of the Chinese characters of the name was later changed to another of the same sound) ASHIKAGA and, traveling via Yajima, <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Omi Province.html&quot;>Omi Province</a> (today's Moriyama City, <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Shiga Prefecture.html&quot;>Shiga Prefecture</a>), sought the protection of <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshikage ASAKURA.html&quot;>Yoshikage ASAKURA</a>, Governor of Echizen Province. </p>
<p>Meanwhile the three men of the Miyoshi family attempted to bring Yoshichika ASHIKAGA (later <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshihide ASHIKAGA.html&quot;>Yoshihide ASHIKAGA</a>), a cousin of Yoshiteru, to the Shogunate in Awaji Province, and entered Tonda (Takatsuki City), Settsu Province (today's Takatsuki City, Osaka Prefecture). <h3>Setting Nanto on fire (<a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Sengoku Period (period of warring states) (Japan).html&quot;>Sengoku Period</a>)</h3>
</p>
<p>The three men of the Miyoshi family, while conspiring to bring Yoshihide to the Shogunate, came to oppose <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Hisahide MATSUNAGA.html&quot;>Hisahide MATSUNAGA</a>, who had gained hold of the administration of the Miyoshi clan after the death of former lord <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Nagayoshi MIYOSHI.html&quot;>Nagayoshi MIYOSHI</a>, and attempted to oust Hisahide under the nominal leadership of incumbent lord <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshitsugu MIYOSHI.html&quot;>Yoshitsugu MIYOSHI</a>. </p>
<p>By then, Hisahide had appointed himself the Governor of <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Yamato Province.html&quot;>Yamato Province</a> by virtue of physical force, and been trying to place the province under his rule. Originally, <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Kofuku-ji Temple.html&quot;>Kofuku-ji Temple</a> had virtual governorship over <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Yamato Province.html&quot;>Yamato Province</a>, and its monk general Junsho TSUTSUI had become a virtual warring lord and ruled <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Yamato.html&quot;>Yamato</a>; however, when Junsho died, taking the advantage of the infancy of his heir Junkei TSUTSUI, Hisahide invaded <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Yamato.html&quot;>Yamato</a> in 1559 at the instruction of Nagayoshi, and deprived the Tsutsui clan of its estate and the <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Kofuku-ji Temple.html&quot;>Kofuku-ji Temple</a> of its governorship. The three men proposed to Junkei and <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Kofuku-ji Temple.html&quot;>Kofuku-ji Temple</a>, both displeased with this development, to attack Hisahide and entered into a clandestine alliance with them. </p>
<p>As the escape of Kakukei from <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Kofuku-ji Temple.html&quot;>Kofuku-ji Temple</a> to Echizen became known, the three men blamed Governor Hisahide's for his oversight, while Hisahide, agitating Yoshitsugu, incumbent head of the Miyoshi clan, who had come to oppose the three men, on his part planned to subjugate the three men. </p>
<p>Thus on December 21 (old calendar), the three men's troops began to invade <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Yamato.html&quot;>Yamato</a> and, together with Junkei TSUTSUI, sieged Tamonyama-jo Castle (in today's Horen-cho, Nara City), where Hisahide had his headquarters. However, as Tamonyama-jo Castle was a solid fortress and the troops of Matsunaga were high in morale, the battle fell into a two-year stalemate, accompanied by minor collisions here and there in the areas surrounding the capital and followed by a gradual calming-off process. </p>
<p>However, Yoshitsugu who had been detained by the three men of the Miyoshi family during this battle, in March and April 1567, escaped from the three men and made peace with <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Hisahide MATSUNAGA.html&quot;>Hisahide MATSUNAGA</a>, with whom he formed a joint front against the three men. To wage an all-out counter-offensive to this move, the three men sent troops to <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Yamato.html&quot;>Yamato</a> in May and June. MATSUNAGA's troops reentered Tamonyama-jo Castle, and the three men and Tsutsui's joint legion encamped on the Mt. Daijoin behind Daijoin of <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Kofuku-ji Temple.html&quot;>Kofuku-ji Temple</a>. After some time, they came downhill and moved their headquarters to the main hall of <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Todai-ji Temple.html&quot;>Todai-ji Temple</a>, from where they attacked Tamonyama-jo Castle. As both sides set various places around on fire during their attack on the opponents, some sub-buildings of <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Todai-ji Temple.html&quot;>Todai-ji Temple</a> and <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Kofuku-ji Temple.html&quot;>Kofuku-ji Temple</a>, together with <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Hannya-ji Temple.html&quot;>Hannya-ji Temple</a>, were burnt one after another. On September 6, Kaidan-in, the Buddhist ordination platform of <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Todai-ji Temple.html&quot;>Todai-ji Temple</a>, was burnt, and the Matsunaga troops encamped on its ruins. This meant an abnormal state in which the two hostile camps took up their respective positions within the premises of <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Todai-ji Temple.html&quot;>Todai-ji Temple</a>, a great prestigious temple since the Nara period, and confronted each other. </p>
<p>And on November 10, 1567, <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Hisahide MATSUNAGA.html&quot;>Hisahide MATSUNAGA</a> staged an all-out attack on the joint troops of the three men and Tsutsui entrenching themselves in the hall housing the great statue of Buddha. The hall was set on fire some time between midnight and 2 a.m., and the whole premises of <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Todai-ji Temple.html&quot;>Todai-ji Temple</a> became a battlefield. Although the troops of the three men and Tsutsui retreated in the meantime, warfare continued in various places in the areas surrounding the capital, including <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Yamato Province.html&quot;>Yamato Province</a>. However, as <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Nobunaga ODA.html&quot;>Nobunaga ODA</a> backing up <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshiaki ASHIKAGA.html&quot;>Yoshiaki ASHIKAGA</a> proceeded to the capital in October 1568, the Eiroku Incident and the ensuing turmoil ended. </p>
<p>The surviving buildings of <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Todai-ji Temple.html&quot;>Todai-ji Temple</a> included Nigatsudo, Hokkedo, <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Shosoin.html&quot;>Shosoin</a>, Nandaimon (literally &quot;southern big gate&quot;), <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Shoro (a tower housing a big Buddhist bell).html&quot;>Shoro</a> (bell tower), Tengaimon (literally &quot;the gate of shifting the evil&quot;) and Nenbutsudo (Buddha invocation hall); although the extent of destruction was smaller than in the burning of Nato by <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/TAIRA no Shigehira.html&quot;>TAIRA no Shigehira</a> during the Taira-Minamoto War, the very fact that <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Todai-ji Temple.html&quot;>Todai-ji Temple</a> itself became a battlefield unlike in the past incident, in which the temple had caught fire from next door, and Daibutsu-den (the Great Buddha hall) itself was set fire shocked people both in and out of the area. Furthermore, the head of Rushanabutsu (the great statue of Buddha) damaged during this fire fell off on a later day, and was left as it was with no budget for repair; it was not until the Jokyo to Genroku years, more than 120 years afterwards, that both the statue itself and its hall were reconstructed. <h3>Issue of Shogunate succession</h3>
</p>
<p>As stated above, the <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html&quot;>Shogun</a> was suddenly killed, and the supreme position in the <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Muromachi Bakufu.html&quot;>Muromachi Bakufu</a> was left vacant. In the Kakitsu Incident in which <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshinori ASHIKAGA.html&quot;>Yoshinori ASHIKAGA</a> was assassinated, his deputy and other officials held consultations and immediately selected the succeeding <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html&quot;>Shogun</a>, but, since Deputy <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Ujitsuna HOSOKAWA.html&quot;>Ujitsuna HOSOKAWA</a> had died in 1563 before the Eiroku Incident, the position of deputy was unfilled, allowing the functions of the <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html&quot;>Bakufu</a> to be virtually halted by the <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html&quot;>Shogun</a>'s death. Furthermore, the Miyoshi and Matsunaga clans ruling <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html&quot;>Kyoto</a> and the <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/family/Asakura clan.html&quot;>Asakura clan</a>, an influential governor in the outskirts of <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html&quot;>Kyoto</a>, backed up different persons for inheritance of the Shogunate. </p>
<p>This situation placed the Imperial Court in agony. In April and May 1566, the Court appointed Yoshiaki Samanokami (the head of the section taking care of imperial horses) with a court rank of Jugoinoge (Junior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade) at the recommendation of <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Kanemigi YOSHIDA.html&quot;>Kanemigi YOSHIDA</a>. The position at the head of <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Meryo (Bureau of Horses).html&quot;>Meryo</a> (the imperial horse caring section) dates back to <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Seiwa-Genji (Minamoto clan).html&quot;>Seiwa-Genji</a> (Minamoto clan), and was often held by a supposed heir to the Shogunate. Alarmed by this <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Appointment (Ninkan).html&quot;>appointment</a>, Yoshihide attempted a rollback, and early in the following year was appointed to the same status, Samanokami with a rank of Jugoinoge. Now, two candidates came to vie for the Shogunate. </p>
<p>Respectively supported by the Miyoshi and Asakura clans, Yoshihide and Yoshiaki were expected soon to proceed to <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html&quot;>Kyoto</a> to be proclaimed as the new <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html&quot;>Shogun</a>. However, the Miyoshi clan was plagued by the continued internal strife between the three men and <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Hisahide MATSUNAGA.html&quot;>Hisahide MATSUNAGA</a>, while the <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/family/Asakura clan.html&quot;>Asakura clan</a> was preoccupied with fighting <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Ikko Ikki.html&quot;>Ikko Ikki</a> (mobbing by mainly peasants faithful to the Ikko sect of Buddhism), both unable to think about sending their <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html&quot;>Shogun</a> candidates to the capital. </p>
<p>Then, the Imperial Court demanded, as an initial measure, the two candidates for Shogunate to donate 10,000 hiki (100 kan) of money as a prerequisite for the requested <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Appointment (Ninkan).html&quot;>appointment</a>. Yoshihide was the first to comply with this demand. Yoshihide succeeded in not only bargaining down the donation of 10,000 hiki to a half but also winning proclamation as <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html&quot;>Shogun</a> at Settsu-Tonda in March and April 1568. However, the situation in <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html&quot;>Kyoto</a> was unstable, and Yoshihide had to postpone his entrance into the capital. Yoshiaki, on the other hand, won the support of <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Nobunaga ODA.html&quot;>Nobunaga ODA</a> of Owari Province in his procession to <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html&quot;>Kyoto</a> in October of the same year, and the Imperial Court, dismissing Yoshihide at Tonda, replaced him with Yoshiaki as the new <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html&quot;>Shogun</a>. Yoshihide fled to Awa Province, but died of illness soon afterwards. </p>
<p>Yoshiaki demanded punishment of those who had tried to have Yoshiteru proclaimed as <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html&quot;>Shogun</a>; <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Sakihisa KONOE.html&quot;>Sakihisa KONOE</a>, (Chief Advisor to the Emperor) and Nagasuke TAKAKURA, Councilor, fled to Ishiyamahongan-ji Temple to take refuge, Gon <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Chunagon.html&quot;>chunagon</a> (Deputy Middle Level Councilor) Haremigi KAJUJI shut up himself in his house as an expression of repentance, and Councilor Chikauji MINASE accompanied Yoshihide in his exile to Awa. While the opposition between the Yoshiaki-Nobunaga pair and the Sakihisa-Ishiyama <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Hongan-ji Temple.html&quot;>Hongan-ji Temple</a> alliance proved to make up a cause of subsequent Genki heiran (the Genki Disturbance), Yoshiaki whose relationship with Nobunaga worsened in the process of warfare made peace with <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Hongan-ji Temple.html&quot;>Hongan-ji Temple</a> to form an Anti-Nobunaga alliance (so-called Nobunaga encircling net), which eventually was defeated by Nobunaga, and the Muromachi <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html&quot;>bakufu</a> collapsed. </p>
