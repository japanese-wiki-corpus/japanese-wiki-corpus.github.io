<h1>So-okite (惣掟)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>So-okite was a statute defined independently by peasants within a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Soson (a community comprising a self-governing association of peasants).html">soson</a> (a community consisting of peasants' self-governing association) in medieval Japan. It is also known as muraokite (village rules) and jige okite (lower class nobles' rules). </p>
<p>Summary<br/>
So-okite was usually resolved in an assembly with all members of a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Soson (a community comprising a self-governing association of peasants).html">soson</a>. Therefore, so-okite was strongly effective to the members of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Soson (a community comprising a self-governing association of peasants).html">soson</a>. The penal regulations were very severe; in particular the crimes that disturbed the order of community (such as theft, arson and homicide) resulted in the death penalty in almost all cases. </p>
<p>On the other hand, although penal regulations for other violations were banishment from a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Soson (a community comprising a self-governing association of peasants).html">soson</a> or confiscation of property, they were usually pardoned after a fixed period (several months to several years) by the public discussion of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Soson (a community comprising a self-governing association of peasants).html">soson</a>. </p>
<p>History<br/>
Before the early medieval period (from the Heian to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> periods), the general public (peasants etc.) were regulated only by the laws established by rulers, such as the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ritsuryo.html">Ritsuryo</a> codes, court noble law, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Honjo (proprietor or guarantor of manor).html">honjo</a> (proprietor or guarantor of manor) law, and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> law. Therefore, only the rulers, such as the lord of a manor and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kokugaryo.html">Kokugaryo</a> (territories governed by provincial government office) and the lord-of-a-manor <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a>, could exercise the jurisdiction and police powers (criminal cases) to the general public. </p>
<p>However, the ruling structure based on the myo (rice field lots in charge of a nominal holder) system deteriorated from the late <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period to the early Muromachi period. The peasants who had lived individually, started to live in a new village and form a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Soson (a community comprising a self-governing association of peasants).html">soson</a> community with strong autonomous concerns and sense of common bonds. Although <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Soson (a community comprising a self-governing association of peasants).html">soson</a> was technically governed by the lord of a manor and Imperial estate or <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a> and jito (military governor and estate steward), the people of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Soson (a community comprising a self-governing association of peasants).html">soson</a> had not necessarily accepted the control of these rulers obediently. They often demanded their rights from rulers as one group. The autonomy of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Soson (a community comprising a self-governing association of peasants).html">soson</a> was increased through such demanding actions. Moreover, rulers could no longer issue a statute and regulation for a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Soson (a community comprising a self-governing association of peasants).html">soson</a> without consent. </p>
<p>Thus, the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Soson (a community comprising a self-governing association of peasants).html">soson</a> acquired various rights through negotiation with their rulers. These rights were stipulated and became regulation within the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Soson (a community comprising a self-governing association of peasants).html">soson</a>. This was the so-okite. Moreover, in order to refuse a certain right to judge criminal cases of the rulers, people of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Soson (a community comprising a self-governing association of peasants).html">soson</a> needed to exercise their own. Then, provisions that a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Soson (a community comprising a self-governing association of peasants).html">soson</a> member should follow were also often stipulated as a domestic statute. This was also the origin of so-okite. </p>
<p>In the Kinai region (provinces surrounding <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and Nara), which was an advanced region at that time, so-okite was most developed quantitatively as well as qualitatively. The so-okite had reached its peak in the middle of Muromachi period and lasted until the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Sengoku Period (period of warring states) (Japan).html">Sengoku Period</a> (Period of Warring States). However, as Sengoku <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> (Japanese territorial lord in the Sengoku period) started to rule the entire region, the autonomy of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Soson (a community comprising a self-governing association of peasants).html">soson</a> was divested, and the autonomy of the so-okite thinned out or disappeared. </p>
