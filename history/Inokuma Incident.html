<p></p>
<p>The Inokuma Incident was a big scandal involving high-ranking officers of the Imperial Court in 1609 the early Edo period. The incident not only disclosed the wild license of court nobles but even triggered tightened control of the Imperial Court by the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Edo bakufu.html">Edo bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a>) and abdication of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Goyozei.html">Emperor Goyozei</a>. </p>
<p>Unparalleled handsome man<br/>
Sakone no shosho (officer of the Imperial guard department) <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Noritoshi INOKUMA.html">Noritoshi INOKUMA</a>, a court noble in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, was renowned for his allegedly 'unparalleled' handsomeness, likened to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Hikaru Genji.html">Hikaru Genji</a>, hero of the Tale of Genji, or <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/ARIWARA no Narihira.html">ARIWARA no Narihira</a> whose love affairs were well known in the Heian period. His hair style and way of tying the sash, which embodied the then fashionable 'kabukimono' (dandy) spirit were called Inokuma-yo (Inokuma style) and are said to have led the mode in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. 
<br/>However, he had also been notorious for his itch for women; having intrigues even with married women and ladies serving in the Imperial Court; he was alleged to be the 'No. 1 rake among court nobles.'<br/>
</p>
<p>In February and March 1607, his adultery with a court lady was revealed, and the infuriated <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Goyozei.html">Emperor Goyozei</a> punished him by chokkan (expulsion from around the Emperor). Inokuma was expelled and once disappeared from <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, but he is said to have returned to the capital unnoticed by others. He never improved in conduct, and invited noble colleagues to repeated adultery with court ladies. </p>
<p>Unveiling of depravity of court nobles<br/>
Sakone gon no shosho (temporary officer of the Imperial guard department) <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Tadanaga KAZANIN.html">Tadanaga KAZANIN</a> fell in love with Hirohashi no tsubone (a daughter of buke tenso (liaison officer between the Imperial Court and the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">Bakufu</a>) and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Dainagon (chief councilor of state).html">Dainagon</a> (chief councilor of state) <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Kanekatsu HIROHASHI.html">Kanekatsu HIROHASHI</a>)) who was in an emperor's favor. Then he asked dentist Bingo KANEYASU (whose younger sister Sanuki was serving in the court as a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Myobu.html">myobu</a> (high-ranking court lady)), who had been allowed admission to the inner quarters of the Court, to go between in the exchange of letters between the lovers, who then began direct meetings with each other. Hearing a rumor of this affair, Inokuma was keenly interested and glibly tempted other court nobles and ladies including his close friend Masakata ASUKAI, and they repeated promiscuous sexual relations in various places. </p>
<p>However, it was impossible to keep such sexual relations secret among so many persons, and in July and August 1609 information on the fact reached the ears of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Goyozei.html">Emperor Goyozei</a> to his vehement wrath. Shrewd in his sense of timing, Inokuma fled straight to Kyushu as soon as he knew its disclosure. His plan is said to have been an escape to Korea of the Rhee Dynasty. </p>
<p>Intervention by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kyoto Shoshidai.html">Kyoto Shoshidai</a> (Shogunate's military governor in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>)<br/>
An infuriated <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Goyozei.html">Emperor Goyozei</a> demanded all the participants in the promiscuous relations be sentenced to death, but no traditional law governing court nobles provided for capital punishment. Moreover, the power of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Edo bakufu.html">Edo bakufu</a> had been penetrating its control over court nobles, and even the authority of criminal investigation also rested with the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">Bakufu</a>. Hearing of the scandal, retired <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Ieyasu TOKUGAWA.html">Ieyasu TOKUGAWA</a> ordered <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kyoto Shoshidai.html">Kyoto Shoshidai</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Katsushige ITAKURA.html">Katsushige ITAKURA</a> and his third son Shigemasa ITAKURA to investigate into the matter. </p>
<p>Along with the progress of investigation, it turned out that an unexpectedly large number of persons were involved, and this gave rise to a fear that condemning all of them to death penalty might invite chaos. Also, the Empress Dowager (real mother of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Goyozei.html">Emperor Goyozei</a>) <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Haruko KAJUJI.html">Haruko KAJUJI</a>'s petition for a lenient disposition reached <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shoshidai.html">Shoshidai</a>. In view of these circumstances, Ieyasu in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Sunpu.html">Sunpu</a> and Katsushige in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, keeping close contact with each other, worked out their proposal for the punishment of the court nobles. </p>
<p>In September and October, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Noritoshi INOKUMA.html">Noritoshi INOKUMA</a> hiding in Hyuga Province was caught and taken under guard to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. </p>
<p>Punishment of court nobles<br/>
On October 20, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shoshidai.html">Shoshidai</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Katsushige ITAKURA.html">Katsushige ITAKURA</a> back from <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Sunpu.html">Sunpu</a> announced the following proposal for the punishment of eight court nobles, five court ladies and one jige (lower class noble) involved in the scandal. </p>

</p>
<p>Although <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Goyozei.html">Emperor Goyozei</a> was very much dissatisfied with this proposal, court nobles and other influential members of the Imperial Court including Shinjotomon-in approved of it, and the penal sentence was finalized. On November 13, Inokuma and Kaneyasu were beheaded at the Jozen-ji Temple and on the bank of the Kamo-gawa River, respectively. </p>
<p>Consequences of the affair<br/>
<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Goyozei.html">Emperor Goyozei</a>, persuaded by his aides into accepting the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">Bakufu</a>'s lukewarm proposal against his demand for capital punishment of all the persons involved, despaired at the circumstances which were out of his control and began to speak of abdication quite often. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/The Emperor (Tenno).html">The Emperor</a> had wished to abdicate his throne in favor of his younger brother Imperial Prince Toshihito HACHIJONOMIYA, but the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">Bakufu</a>, the arch enemy of the Toyotomi family, was against his wish, as the Prince had been once a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Yushi (privately adopted child).html">yushi</a> (an adopted son in an old Japanese way) of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI.html">Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI</a>, and it also was the intention of Ieyasu who wanted judai (entering the Imperial Palace after an official ceremony) of Kazuko TOKUGAWA, a daughter of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Hidetada TOKUGAWA.html">Hidetada TOKUGAWA</a>, as a consort of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Gomizunoo.html">Emperor Gomizunoo</a>, a son of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Goyozei.html">Emperor Goyozei</a>, with the consequence that the Emperor was not free even to abdicate. Eventually, the Emperor's abdication in favor of Imperial Prince Kotohito was postponed until 1611. </p>
<p>Meanwhile the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">Bakufu</a>, worried by the lax morals of court nobles, realized the importance of controlling them more strictly, resulting in the institution of Kugeshu <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Hatto (Lecture Hall).html">hatto</a> (the regulatory law for court nobles) in 1613 and further leading to that of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kinchu narabini kuge shohatto (Law on the emperor and the court nobles).html">Kinchu narabini kuge shohatto</a> (the regulatory laws for the Emperor and court nobles) in 1615. </p>

The TV-adapted story differs from historical facts in that, in the TV play, even the name of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Noritoshi INOKUMA.html">Noritoshi INOKUMA</a> is not mentioned, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Karahashi (a maid housed in the inner rooms of the shoguns palace called O-oku).html">Karahashi</a> no Tsubone is a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Naishi.html">naishi</a> no jo (a woman officer who carries the Emperor's sword when accompanying him out of the Palace), Bingo KANEYASU is a watchdog at the Okunomon (Inside Gate), the destination of banishment of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Tadanaga KAZANIN.html">Tadanaga KAZANIN</a> is Tsugaru, the punishment of court nobles was intended by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Ieyasu TOKUGAWA.html">Ieyasu TOKUGAWA</a> to expel pro-Toyotomi nobles from the Imperial Court, and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Ieyasu TOKUGAWA.html">Ieyasu TOKUGAWA</a> disagreed to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Goyozei.html">Emperor Goyozei</a>'s proposal only to restrain the behaviors of Hirohashi no Tsubone and other court ladies and instead ordered them to be banished (this means that <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Goyozei.html">Emperor Goyozei</a>'s proposal for punishment had been more lenient). </p>

Hearing of the scandal, retired <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html&quot;>Shogun</a> <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Ieyasu TOKUGAWA.html&quot;>Ieyasu TOKUGAWA</a> ordered <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kyoto Shoshidai.html&quot;>Kyoto Shoshidai</a> <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Katsushige ITAKURA.html&quot;>Katsushige ITAKURA</a> and his third son Shigemasa ITAKURA to investigate into the matter. </p>
<p>Along with the progress of investigation, it turned out that an unexpectedly large number of persons were involved, and this gave rise to a fear that condemning all of them to death penalty might invite chaos. Also, the Empress Dowager (real mother of <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Goyozei.html&quot;>Emperor Goyozei</a>) <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Haruko KAJUJI.html&quot;>Haruko KAJUJI</a>'s petition for a lenient disposition reached <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shoshidai.html&quot;>Shoshidai</a>. In view of these circumstances, Ieyasu in <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Sunpu.html&quot;>Sunpu</a> and Katsushige in <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html&quot;>Kyoto</a>, keeping close contact with each other, worked out their proposal for the punishment of the court nobles. </p>
<p>In September and October, <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Noritoshi INOKUMA.html&quot;>Noritoshi INOKUMA</a> hiding in Hyuga Province was caught and taken under guard to <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html&quot;>Kyoto</a>. </p>
<p>Punishment of court nobles<br/>
On October 20, <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shoshidai.html&quot;>Shoshidai</a> <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Katsushige ITAKURA.html&quot;>Katsushige ITAKURA</a> back from <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Sunpu.html&quot;>Sunpu</a> announced the following proposal for the punishment of eight court nobles, five court ladies and one jige (lower class noble) involved in the scandal. </p>

</p>
<p>Although <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Goyozei.html&quot;>Emperor Goyozei</a> was very much dissatisfied with this proposal, court nobles and other influential members of the Imperial Court including Shinjotomon-in approved of it, and the penal sentence was finalized. On November 13, Inokuma and Kaneyasu were beheaded at the Jozen-ji Temple and on the bank of the Kamo-gawa River, respectively. </p>
<p>Consequences of the affair<br/>
<a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Goyozei.html&quot;>Emperor Goyozei</a>, persuaded by his aides into accepting the <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html&quot;>Bakufu</a>'s lukewarm proposal against his demand for capital punishment of all the persons involved, despaired at the circumstances which were out of his control and began to speak of abdication quite often. </p>
<p><a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/The Emperor (Tenno).html&quot;>The Emperor</a> had wished to abdicate his throne in favor of his younger brother Imperial Prince Toshihito HACHIJONOMIYA, but the <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html&quot;>Bakufu</a>, the arch enemy of the Toyotomi family, was against his wish, as the Prince had been once a <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Yushi (privately adopted child).html&quot;>yushi</a> (an adopted son in an old Japanese way) of <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI.html&quot;>Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI</a>, and it also was the intention of Ieyasu who wanted judai (entering the Imperial Palace after an official ceremony) of Kazuko TOKUGAWA, a daughter of <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Hidetada TOKUGAWA.html&quot;>Hidetada TOKUGAWA</a>, as a consort of <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Gomizunoo.html&quot;>Emperor Gomizunoo</a>, a son of <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Goyozei.html&quot;>Emperor Goyozei</a>, with the consequence that the Emperor was not free even to abdicate. Eventually, the Emperor's abdication in favor of Imperial Prince Kotohito was postponed until 1611. </p>
<p>Meanwhile the <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html&quot;>Bakufu</a>, worried by the lax morals of court nobles, realized the importance of controlling them more strictly, resulting in the institution of Kugeshu <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Hatto (Lecture Hall).html&quot;>hatto</a> (the regulatory law for court nobles) in 1613 and further leading to that of <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kinchu narabini kuge shohatto (Law on the emperor and the court nobles).html&quot;>Kinchu narabini kuge shohatto</a> (the regulatory laws for the Emperor and court nobles) in 1615. </p>

The TV-adapted story differs from historical facts in that, in the TV play, even the name of <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Noritoshi INOKUMA.html&quot;>Noritoshi INOKUMA</a> is not mentioned, <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Karahashi (a maid housed in the inner rooms of the shoguns palace called O-oku).html&quot;>Karahashi</a> no Tsubone is a <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Naishi.html&quot;>naishi</a> no jo (a woman officer who carries the Emperor's sword when accompanying him out of the Palace), Bingo KANEYASU is a watchdog at the Okunomon (Inside Gate), the destination of banishment of <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Tadanaga KAZANIN.html&quot;>Tadanaga KAZANIN</a> is Tsugaru, the punishment of court nobles was intended by <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Ieyasu TOKUGAWA.html&quot;>Ieyasu TOKUGAWA</a> to expel pro-Toyotomi nobles from the Imperial Court, and <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Ieyasu TOKUGAWA.html&quot;>Ieyasu TOKUGAWA</a> disagreed to <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Goyozei.html&quot;>Emperor Goyozei</a>'s proposal only to restrain the behaviors of Hirohashi no Tsubone and other court ladies and instead ordered them to be banished (this means that <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Goyozei.html&quot;>Emperor Goyozei</a>'s proposal for punishment had been more lenient). </p>
