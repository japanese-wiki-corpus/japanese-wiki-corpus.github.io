<h1>Buei Sodo (武衛騒動)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The Buei Sodo was an internal conflict that occurred within the Muromachi bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun) in 1465. </p>
<p>Taking advantage of the trust placed in him by eighth Shogun Yoshimasa ASHIKAGA's, shogun family steward Sadachika ISE filled his own pockets and plunged the bakufu into chaos by intervening the internal troubles of the Shiba clan among Kanrei families (families in the position of the shogunal deputy) and by mediating between Yoshitoshi SHIBA and Yoshikado SHIBA. Outraged by the arrogance with which Yoshimasa interfered in the Kanrei families' affairs despite his position as a mere steward, the leaders Katsumoto HOSOKAWA and Sozen YAMANA came together to banish Sadachika from the bakufu. </p>
<p>It is said that the expulsion of the anticipated successor as shogun, Yoshimi ASHIKAGA, was involved in the events leading up to the dispute. When Onin War subsequently broke out due to the conflict between Katsumoto and Sozen, Sadachika was pardoned and reinstated.. </p>
