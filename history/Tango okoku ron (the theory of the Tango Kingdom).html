<h1><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Tango (the Boys Festival).html">Tango</a> okoku ron (the theory of the Tango Kingdom) (丹後王国論)</h1>
<p></p>
<p><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Tango (the Boys Festival).html">Tango</a> okoku ron is a theory in which Teiji KADOWAKI asserted an existence of "Tango Kingdom" in and around <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Tango (the Boys Festival).html">Tango</a> region (present Tango City, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>) during the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kofun period (tumulus period).html">Kofun period</a> (tumulus period), which is believed to have been independent and rivaled <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yamato.html">Yamato</a> sovereignty (the ancient Japan sovereignty) (It is also referred to as "Tanba Kingdom" because <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Tango Province.html">Tango Province</a> was divided from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Tanba Province.html">Tanba Province</a> later). </p>
<p>According to Teiji KADOWAKI, the peak of "Tango Kingdom" was the mid to late fourth century to the fifth century. He assumes that the kingdom came under control of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yamato.html">Yamato</a> sovereignty along with the conquest of Izumo by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yamato.html">Yamato</a> in the mid sixth century. </p>
<p>Background<br/>
It is believed that an independent power existed in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Tango (the Boys Festival).html">Tango</a> region in ancient times due to a large tumulus center found there (Aminochoshiyama Burial Mound, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Shinmeiyama-kofun Tumulus.html">Shinmeiyama-kofun Tumulus</a>, Ebisuyama-kofun Tumulus, and the like), as well as recent excavations and researches. </p>
