<h1>Funyu no ken (Japan) (不入の権 (日本))</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Funyu no ken is the right of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> (manor in medieval Japan) to decline the entry of messengers (Kendenshi, Shunoshi, Shidoshi, etc.) from the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kokuga (provincial government office compounds).html">Kokuga</a> (provincial government offices)<br/>
Later, it included the right to decline the wielding of policing rights by the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kebiishi (police and judicial chief).html">kebiishi</a> (officials with judicial and police powers) and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kokuga (provincial government office compounds).html">Kokuga</a>, and the right to police by the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> holder. </p>
<p>In general, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> with funyu no ken in many cases also had fuyu no ken (the right of tax exemption) (Japan) and these two rights are often considered as a set. However, while Handen Shuju ho (the law of periodic reallocations of rice land) was functioning, the handenshi (land reallocator) would survey rice fields that had fuyu no ken and confirm that they were excluded as targets of handen and in later years, there were rice fields that had fuyu no ken, but did not have funyu no ken. </p>
<p>For fuyu no ken to be recognized, it was necessary to apply for each rich field, but as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Desaku.html">desaku</a> (an act in which farmers who live in a certain <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> cultivate lands of other)became common and the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> side wished to include this as part of the land with fuyu no ken, a conflict arose with the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kokushi.html">Kokushi</a> side, which wanted to stop this. In addition, in odder to introduce Ikkoku heikinyaku (taxes and labor uniformly imposed on <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> and provincial land in a province) as well as to decide on target lands for Manor Regulation Acts, the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kokuga (provincial government office compounds).html">kokuga</a> began to intervene into rice fields that were recognized to have fuyu no ken. Therefore, the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> side obtained a decree of funyu no ken and tried to eliminate any intervention from the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kokuga (provincial government office compounds).html">Kokuga</a>. In addition, because <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kebiishi (police and judicial chief).html">kebiishi</a> sometimes worked to collect taxes, a movement to keep <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kebiishi (police and judicial chief).html">kebiishi</a> from entering <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> also arose and this led to the elimination of their policing rights, which was the actual task of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kebiishi (police and judicial chief).html">kebiishi</a>. The movement towards eliminating policing rights by funyu no ken was advocated and was made into a privilege even after policing rights were transferred to the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>) as '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a> funyu' (the right to keep <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a> [provincial constable] from entering the property) and this continued until the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> system was eliminated by the Sengoku <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> (Japanese territorial lord in the Sengoku period). </p>
