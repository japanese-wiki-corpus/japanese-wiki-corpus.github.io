<h1>Coup of the seventh year of Kenkyu (建久七年の政変)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Coup of the seventh year of Kenkyu was a coup that took place in 1196. </p>
<p><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Yoritomo.html">MINAMOTO no Yoritomo</a> had <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kanezane KUJO.html">Kanezane KUJO</a> as his spokesman at the Imperial Court, however, at the time of his daughter <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Ohime (A Daughter of MINAMOTO no Yoritomo).html">Ohime</a>'s judai (an Imperial Consort's bridal entry into court) for the Emperor Gotoba, he consulted <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Michichika.html">MINAMOTO no Michichika</a>, who was anti-Kanezane and even anti-bakufu, and not Kanezane. </p>
<p>In 1195, Ninshi gave birth to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Imperial Princess Shoshi.html">Imperial Princess Shoshi</a>, the emperor's daughter, and MINAMOTO no Zaishi, Michichika's daughter, gave birth to Imperial Prince Tamehito (later called the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Tsuchimikado.html">Emperor Tsuchimikado</a>). On December 21, 1196, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Chugu.html">chugu</a> (Palace of the Empress) <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Ninshi KUJO.html">Ninshi KUJO</a> was expelled from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kokyu (empresss residence).html">kokyu</a> (empress's residence) and on the 23rd of the same month, kanpaku <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kanezane KUJO.html">Kanezane KUJO</a> was dismissed and was replaced by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Motomichi KONOE.html">Motomichi KONOE</a>; Takayosho ICHIJO, whose mother was the sister of Yoritomo, Bomon hime, was appointed as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Sangi.html">sangi</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kintsune SAIONJI.html">Kintsune SAIONJI</a>, the husband of Bomon hime's daughter, was appointed as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kurodo no to (the name of a post).html">Kurodo no to</a> (Head Chamberlain), and on the 24th of the same month, Jien, the head priest of the Tendai sect of Buddhism, was ordered to stay inside the residence, and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Kanefusa.html">FUJIWARA no Kanefusa</a>, the Grand Minister, was reshuffled (both Jien and Kanefusa were both Kanezane's younger brother-uterine). </p>
<p>The ringleaders were Michichika TSUCHIMIKADO and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Tango (the Boys Festival).html">Tango</a> no tsubone, anti-Kanezane. They were both <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Goshirakawa.html">Emperor Goshirakawa</a>'s trusted vassals. It is also said that they did not intend to cooperate Yoritomo. According to a theory, Yoritomo remained silence even after hearing this plan. </p>
<p>As a result, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Ohime (A Daughter of MINAMOTO no Yoritomo).html">Ohime</a> died a year later in 1197, before the plan of judai was put into practice. In the following year, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Takayoshi ICHIJO.html">Takayoshi ICHIJO</a> died of illness and Yoritomo died in 1199 without getting a spokesman in the Imperial Court. Michichika TSUCHIMIKADO gained the real power, however, in 1200, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshitsune KUJO.html">Yoshitsune KUJO</a>, the legitimate son of the Kujo family, who he thought had defeated, came back to power as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Sadaijin (Minister of the Left).html">Sadaijin</a> (minister of the left), which he was appointed; Michichika, on the other hand, died in 1202. Two months after the death of Michichika, Yoshitaune KUJO was appointed as Sessho Daijo daijin (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Regent.html">Regent</a> and the Grand Minister). </p>
