<h1>Inaba Sodo (Inaba Riot) (稲葉騒動)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The Inaba Riot was a large scale uprising of peasants which broke out in the Nishiowari region (133 villages of Inazawa, Bisai, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Ichinomiya.html">Ichinomiya</a> and Tsushima [today's Aichi Prefecture in Japan]) in January 1870. </p>
<p>It is called the 'Inaba Riot' because it started at the Inaba post station of Minoji. The riot lasted for 4 days and more than 30,000 people participated. However, it was suppressed by gunfire from Owari Domain soldiers including some from the peasant army. </p>
<p>The Domain side used a cannon and inflicted a large number of peasant casualties. </p>
<p>This is said to have ushered in the peasant revolt against the land-tax reform which is famous with the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Haiku.html">Haiku</a> meaning 'Poke 2.5% tax cut with bamboo lances.'<br/>
</p>
<p>Details are written in page 597 of the 'Shinshu Inazawashi-shi Honbun-hen I' (New Edition of the history of Inazawa City, Text I). </p>
