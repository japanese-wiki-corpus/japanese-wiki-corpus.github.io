<h1>The Battle of Sattatoge (the period of the Northern and Southern Courts) (薩た峠の戦い (南北朝時代))</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The Battle of Sattatoge (also referred to as the Battle of Mt. Satta) was a battle fought between the troops of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Takauji ASHIKAGA.html">Takauji ASHIKAGA</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Tadayoshi ASHIKAGA.html">Tadayoshi ASHIKAGA</a> at Sattatoge (Satta-toge Pass) in Suruga Province (Shimizu Ward, Shizuoka City, Shizuoka Prefecture) in December 1351, during the period of the Northern and Southern Courts. </p>
<p>At the occurrence of the Kanno Disturbance, the Northern Court (Japan) was split into the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Takauji ASHIKAGA.html">Takauji ASHIKAGA</a> faction and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Tadayoshi ASHIKAGA.html">Tadayoshi ASHIKAGA</a> faction. The conflict continued even after the premeditated murder of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/KO no Moronao.html">KO no Moronao</a> and his brother <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/KO no Moroyasu.html">KO no Moroyasu</a> by the Tadayoshi faction, and in 1351, Tadayoshi fled from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Busho.html">busho</a> (Japanese military commander) who belonged to his faction, including Tadatsune MOMONOI, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Takatsune SHIBA.html">Takatsune SHIBA</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Tokiuji YAMANA.html">Tokiuji YAMANA</a>, and reached Kamakura City via Hokuriku Region and Shinano Province. After making peace with the Southern Court (Japan), Takauji was given an order from the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Gomurakami.html">Emperor Gomurakami</a> to search out and destroy <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Tadayoshi ASHIKAGA.html">Tadayoshi ASHIKAGA</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Tadafuyu ASHIKAGA.html">Tadafuyu ASHIKAGA</a>. He left <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshiakira ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshiakira ASHIKAGA</a> in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, and took the Tokai-do Road eastward with Yoriaki NIKI, Yoshinaga NIKI, and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kunikiyo HATAKEYAMA.html">Kunikiyo HATAKEYAMA</a>. Tadayoshi advanced westward with troops of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Noriaki UESUGI.html">Noriaki UESUGI</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshifusa ISHIDO.html">Yoshifusa ISHIDO</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yorifusa ISHIDO.html">Yorifusa ISHIDO</a>. The two forces plunged into a battle at Sattatoge, Suruga Province, which was a dangerous spot on the Tokai-do Road. After winning the battle, Takauji and his troops successively defeated the troops of Tadayoshi in the battle of Hayakawajiri, Sagami Province (Odawara City, Kanagawa Prefecture) and other battles, and the following year, in 1352, Tadayoshi surrendered to Takauji. Tadayoshi was confined to the Enfuku-ji Temple on the precincts of the Jomyo-ji Temple, and died suddenly on March 20. It is generally believed that he died of illness, but "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Taiheiki (Record of the Great Peace).html">Taiheiki</a>" (The Record of the Great Peace) exceptionally states that he was murdered by poisoning. </p>
