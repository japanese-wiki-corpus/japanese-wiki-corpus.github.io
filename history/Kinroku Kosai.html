<h1>Kinroku Kosai (金禄公債)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kinroku Kosai was the public bond issued for people in the class below aristocrats in compensation for the abolition of the Roku-rewarding system after the Meiji Restoration. </p>
<p>The grand total of bonds reached 173,908,900 yen with four types of interest rate of 10%, 7%, 6%, and 5%. The number of people qualified to receive the bond, who were paid previously under the roku system, rose to 340,000. The bond was issued in 1877. </p>
<p>In September, 1875, the Meiji government supplied cash currency to each region, in the amount equal to 3 years worth of roku-type reward distributed in rice (Kinroku). </p>
<p>To avoid a government financial crisis, the government abandoned the roku-rewarding system, and established the kinroku kosai, a 30-year government bond, with a deferment period of 5 years; the interest rates were 7% for less than 100 yen, and 5% for more than 1000 yen. </p>
<p>Among bonds issued at the time, it was issued in the largest quantity, reaching a grand total of 173 million 900 thousand yen; all payments were completed in 1890. </p>
