<h1>Goefu (五衛府)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Goefu was the central military organization under the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ritsuryo System.html">Ritsuryo System</a> whose main missions were the personal protection of an emperor, the protection of Kyujo (place where an emperor lives), the night patrol in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and so on. It accompanied an emperor during his daily life and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Gyoko.html">gyoko</a> (emperor going out). </p>
<p>Although army corps (in ancient Japan) under the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ritsuryo System.html">Ritsuryo System</a> were placed in various provinces, efu (a palace guard) was stationed in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. </p>
<p>Transition<br/>
Goefu system which consisted of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Emonfu (Headquarters of the Outer Palace Gate Guard).html">Emonfu</a> (headquarters of the outer palace guards), Left/Right Ejifu (division of guards) and Left/Right <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Hyoefu (the Middle Palace Guards).html">Hyoefu</a> (headquarters of the middle palace guards) was adopted in Taiho-ryo (Taiho Code set up in 701) and Yoro-ryo (Yoro Code set up in 718). Afterward, through struggles for succession to the Imperial Throne and accompanying power struggles among nobles, the military organization was reformed many times so as to work in their favor. Finally from 811 onward, the organization was fixed in the rokuefu system which consisted of Left/Right <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Konoefu (Headquarters of the Inner Palace Guards).html">Konoefu</a> (headquarters of the inner palace guards), Left/Right <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Emonfu (Headquarters of the Outer Palace Gate Guard).html">Emonfu</a> and Left/Right <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Hyoefu (the Middle Palace Guards).html">Hyoefu</a>. </p>
<p>Organization<br/>
Shitokans (bureaucrats of the fourth rank) of Toku (Captain), Sa (Asst. Captain), I (Lieutenant) and Shi (Asst. Lieutenant) were placed in each goefu. 200 kadobes (soldiers who guard palace gates), 30 monobes (military officers who are concerned with punishments) and eji (a guard) were placed under them in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Emonfu (Headquarters of the Outer Palace Gate Guard).html">Emonfu</a>. Eji was placed in Ejifu. In <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Hyoefu (the Middle Palace Guards).html">Hyoefu</a>, 400 people were placed at Left/Right Hyoe (palace guard) respectively to form the military power of each efu. </p>
<p>Eji is considered to have been supplemented conveniently as its fixed number was not provided in the Codes. Later, the number to be levied by the province was fixed in 718. </p>
<p>Duties<br/>
Monobes were assigned police duties mainly. They were also placed at prison offices of Gyobusho (the department of criminal punishments) and ichi-no-tsukasa (governmental organization). </p>
