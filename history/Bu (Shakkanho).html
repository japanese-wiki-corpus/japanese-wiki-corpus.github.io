<h1>Bu (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shakkanho (traditional system of weights and measures).html">Shakkanho</a>) (歩 (尺貫法))</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Bu is a unit of length under the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shakkanho (traditional system of weights and measures).html">shakkanho</a> (old Japanese system of weights and measures). </p>
<p>The unit originated in the Zhou Dynasty in China. Bu was body measurement and "one bu" was the length of two steps. It was later related to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shaku.html">shaku</a> and considered to be equal to the length of six or eight <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shaku.html">shaku</a>. Six <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shaku.html">shaku</a> (about 1.8 m) and eight <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shaku.html">shaku</a> (about 2.4 m) are actually longer than the length of two steps, however, because bu was related to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shaku.html">shaku</a> at a time when a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shaku.html">shaku</a> was shorter than it is now. The unit of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shaku.html">shaku</a> became longer, so the unit of bu became longer. </p>
<p>The unit of length based on a step was used around the world, and pace (about 76cm) was used in English-speaking countries while Shuritt (71-75cm) was used in Germany. The unit of passus was used in ancient Rome and mile originated from mille passuum (thousandfold passus). </p>
<p>"Bu"also means a unit of area, one square bu (six <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shaku.html">shaku</a>). <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Tsubo (a unit of area in old Japanese system of weights and measures originated in China).html">Tsubo</a> is also a unit of area in Japan and one <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Tsubo (a unit of area in old Japanese system of weights and measures originated in China).html">tsubo</a> is equal to one bu. "Bu" as a unit of area is detailed in an article "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Tsubo (a unit of area in old Japanese system of weights and measures originated in China).html">tsubo</a>." </p>
