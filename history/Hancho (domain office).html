<h1>Hancho (domain office) (藩庁)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Hancho is a political term used during the Edo period. </p>
<p>Summary<br/>
Hancho was a place (a castle or a mansion) where the office of a domain was set up under the shogunate system. </p>
<p><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">Daimyo</a> (feudal lord) and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Hanshi.html">hanshi</a> (feudal retainer of domain) were stationed in hancho to handle the domain's administrative affairs. </p>
<p>Large scale domains set up their own hancho in a castle, and small domains in a mansion called <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Jinya.html">jinya</a>. 
<br/>Among them were some domains which did not set up their own hancho, and they were called ''mujinya (domains without regional government office).''<br/>
</p>
<p>The towns that developed around hancho were called <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Jinyamachi (town around feudal lords residence).html">jinyamachi</a>, and those that developed around a castle <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Jokamachi.html">jokamachi</a> (castle towns). </p>
