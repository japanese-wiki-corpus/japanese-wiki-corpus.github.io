<h1>Hancho (domain office) (藩庁)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Hancho is a political term used during the Edo period. </p>
<p>Summary<br/>
Hancho was a place (a castle or a mansion) where the office of a domain was set up under the shogunate system. </p>
<p>Daimyo (feudal lord) and hanshi (feudal retainer of domain) were stationed in hancho to handle the domain's administrative affairs. </p>
<p>Large scale domains set up their own hancho in a castle, and small domains in a mansion called jinya. 
<br/>Among them were some domains which did not set up their own hancho, and they were called ''mujinya (domains without regional government office).''<br/>
</p>
<p>The towns that developed around hancho were called jinyamachi, and those that developed around a castle jokamachi (castle towns). </p>
