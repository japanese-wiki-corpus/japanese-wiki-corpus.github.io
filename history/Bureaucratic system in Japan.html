<h1>Bureaucratic system in Japan (日本の官制)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>In this portion, an overview of the governance in pre-modern times will be given, especially under the ritsuryo system (a system of centralized government based on the ritsuryo code) which was abolished. Refer to the modern Japanese bureaucratic system for modern administrative system, and the Japanese state institution for the current administrative system, respectively. </p>
<p>Before the ritsuryo system (Taiho Code)<br/>
Before the ritsuryo system, no systematic bureaucracy was established. </p>
<p>In the formative period of the Yamato Dynasty, clans called 'uji' appeared from consanguineous groups called 'kabane,' and such professional groups called 'uji' or 'be' took charge of duties according to their power and ability. Each 'uji' and 'be' possessed and ruled their land and people (the system of bemin, the people in subordinate position). The dynasty gradually made 'kabane,' 'uji,' and 'be' incorporated into a hierarchy, and these private groups were organized in a public system. (Refer to the system of clans and hereditary titles, namely the decree of the eight honorary titles). </p>
<p>The official rank (cap rank) system (the system where a government post was associated with a court rank) was also adopted in order to consolidate the government headed by the imperial families (a clan of okimi [Yamato Dynasty]) and to appoint talented people into government service free from blood relations and influence. The twelve court rank (cap rank) system which was enacted by Prince Shotoku in 603 was the first instance of this. This court rank system changed several times from the twelve court rank system of 603 to the system of and official court ranks based on the ritsuryo code. </p>
<p>The ritsuryo system was systematically developed from a system of clans and hereditary titles, official court rank system, and official duties. The first administrative code ('ryo' in Japanese), the Omi Code, was enacted in 668, and the Asuka Kiyomihara Code enacted in 689 is said to have been the first systematized code. The Taiho Code enacted in 701 was the integration of those codes. </p>
<p>After the ritsuryo system (the Taiho Code)<br/>
Refer to the "ritsuryo system" for the ritsuryo system, "official court rank" for official rank system, and "Ikai (Court rank)" for Ikai, respectively. </p>
<p>System of government in the ritsuryo system, and particularly government posts are explained below. </p>
<p><h3>Central government bureaucratic system</h3>
</p>
<p>The Central government bureaucratic system was an organization based on two departments and eight ministries. Under the emperor as a sovereign ruler, Jingikan (the office in charge of religious ceremony) and Daijokan (Grand Council of State) were established and under the Daijokan, eight ministries were set up to take charge of the actual administration. Other than the two departments and eight ministries, Danjodai which inspected administrative organization and Efu (a palace guard) were established under the emperor's direct control (Two departments, eight ministries, one board of censorship and five palace guards in total). Under the eight ministries, practical organizations called Shiki (ritsuryo system), Ryo (ritsuryo system) and Tsukasa were set up. When those organizations became outdated later on, posts outside the original ritsuryo code (Ryoge no kan) were set up to fit with the times. </p>
<p>While the ritsuryo system in China concentrated all power in the emperor, who was supported by three ministries of Secretariat, Chancellery and State Affairs, Japanese ritsuryo system was characterized by the establishment of a loose consultative body, namely Daijokan (Grand Council of State), which worked as the emperor's proxy between the emperor and ministries. </p>
<p>Kan' indicated a government office itself, and is different from present usage as a 'government officer.'<br/>
<h3>Two departments</h3>
</p>
<p>Jingikan (Department of Divinities) - in charge of Shinto religious ritual. </p>
<p>Dajokan (Grand Council of State) - in charge of the overall state government. It was composed of a consultative legislative organization including Daijo-daijin (grand minister of state), Sadaijin (minister of the left), Udaijin (minister of the right) and Dainagon (chief councilor of state), and its subordinates, namely, Shonagonkyoku (Lesser Counselors' Office) and Sayu Benkankyoku (the left Controllers' Office and the right Controllers' Office). Naidaijin (the Minister of the Interior), Chunagon (Middle Counselor), and Sangi (councilor) were established later. </p>
<p>Shonagon Office (Lesser Counselors' Office): a bureau of office and secretary for Dajyokan. It was composed of Shonagon (lesser councilor of state), Daigeki (Senior Secretary), Shogeki (Junior Secretary), Shisho (the office in charge of miscellaneous duties concerning documents), and Shibe (the lowest rank office). </p>
<p>Left and Right Benkan Office: the Left Benkan Office (the left Controllers' Office) and Right Benkan Office (the right Controllers' Office). These offices were in charge of administering affairs of state under the supervision of the legislative organization. It consisted of Dachusho ben (Benkan [Oversight Department]), Daisho shi (clerk [ritsuryo system]), Shisho, Kajo (office under Controllers of Grand Council of State) and Shibu. </p>
