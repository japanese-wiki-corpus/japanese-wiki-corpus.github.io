<p>In this portion, an overview of the governance in pre-modern times will be given, especially under the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Ritsuryo.html">ritsuryo</a> system (a system of centralized government based on the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Ritsuryo.html">ritsuryo</a> code) which was abolished. Refer to the modern Japanese bureaucratic system for modern administrative system, and the Japanese state institution for the current administrative system, respectively. </p>
<p>Before the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Ritsuryo.html">ritsuryo</a> system (Taiho Code)<br/>
Before the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Ritsuryo.html">ritsuryo</a> system, no systematic bureaucracy was established. </p>
<p>In the formative period of the Yamato Dynasty, clans called 'uji' appeared from consanguineous groups called '<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kabane (hereditary title).html">kabane</a>,' and such professional groups called 'uji' or 'be' took charge of duties according to their power and ability. Each 'uji' and 'be' possessed and ruled their land and people (the system of bemin, the people in subordinate position). The dynasty gradually made '<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kabane (hereditary title).html">kabane</a>,' 'uji,' and 'be' incorporated into a hierarchy, and these private groups were organized in a public system. (Refer to the system of clans and hereditary titles, namely the decree of the eight honorary titles). </p>
<p>The official rank (cap rank) system (the system where a government post was associated with a court rank) was also adopted in order to consolidate the government headed by the imperial families (a clan of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Okimi (great king) (Yamato sovereignty).html">okimi</a> [Yamato Dynasty]) and to appoint talented people into government service free from blood relations and influence. The twelve court rank (cap rank) system which was enacted by Prince Shotoku in 603 was the first instance of this. This court rank system changed several times from the twelve court rank system of 603 to the system of and official court ranks based on the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Ritsuryo.html">ritsuryo</a> code. </p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Ritsuryo.html">ritsuryo</a> system was systematically developed from a system of clans and hereditary titles, official court rank system, and official duties. The first administrative code ('ryo' in Japanese), the Omi Code, was enacted in 668, and the Asuka Kiyomihara Code enacted in 689 is said to have been the first systematized code. The Taiho Code enacted in 701 was the integration of those codes. </p>
<p>After the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Ritsuryo.html">ritsuryo</a> system (the Taiho Code)<br/>
Refer to the "<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Ritsuryo.html">ritsuryo</a> system" for the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Ritsuryo.html">ritsuryo</a> system, "official court rank" for official rank system, and "Ikai (Court rank)" for Ikai, respectively. </p>
<p>System of government in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Ritsuryo.html">ritsuryo</a> system, and particularly government posts are explained below. </p>
<p><h3>Central government bureaucratic system</h3>
</p>
<p>The Central government bureaucratic system was an organization based on two departments and eight ministries. Under the emperor as a sovereign ruler, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Jingikan.html">Jingikan</a> (the office in charge of religious ceremony) and Daijokan (Grand Council of State) were established and under the Daijokan, eight ministries were set up to take charge of the actual administration. Other than the two departments and eight ministries, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Danjodai (Board of Censors).html">Danjodai</a> which inspected administrative organization and Efu (a palace guard) were established under the emperor's direct control (Two departments, eight ministries, one board of censorship and five palace guards in total). Under the eight ministries, practical organizations called <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shiki (a rank in government offices under ritsuryo system).html">Shiki</a> (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Ritsuryo.html">ritsuryo</a> system), Ryo (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Ritsuryo.html">ritsuryo</a> system) and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Tsukasa (a rank in government offices).html">Tsukasa</a> were set up. When those organizations became outdated later on, posts outside the original <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Ritsuryo.html">ritsuryo</a> code (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Ryoge no kan (class outside of the Ritsuryo system).html">Ryoge no kan</a>) were set up to fit with the times. </p>
<p>While the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Ritsuryo.html">ritsuryo</a> system in China concentrated all power in the emperor, who was supported by three ministries of Secretariat, Chancellery and State Affairs, Japanese <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Ritsuryo.html">ritsuryo</a> system was characterized by the establishment of a loose consultative body, namely Daijokan (Grand Council of State), which worked as the emperor's proxy between the emperor and ministries. </p>
<p>Kan' indicated a government office itself, and is different from present usage as a 'government officer.'<br/>
