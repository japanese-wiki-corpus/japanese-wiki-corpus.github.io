<h1>Mumon-ginsen Coin (無文銀銭)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Mumon-ginsen coin is the Japan's oldest private silver coin. 
<br/>Some people argue that Mumon-ginsen coin was not 'a coin,' because it was practically exchanged based on the value of bare metal (In western Japan, silver Hyoryo kahei coins [currency valued by weight] such as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Mameitagin (an Edo-period type of coin).html">mameitagin</a> [an Edo-period coin] and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Chogin (Silver coins).html">Chogin</a> [collective term of silver] were used even in the later Edo period.)<br/>
</p>
<p>Mumon-ginsen coin has a diameter of approx. 3cm, and a thickness of approx. 2mm, with a weight of approx. 8-10g (It is equivalent to 6 shu [one ryo = 24 shu] which is one fourth of one ryo in the ancient times.)<br/>
Totally 120 Mumon-ginsen coins are excavated from seventeen sites around Japan including seven places in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yamato Province.html">Yamato Province</a>, six places in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Omi Province.html">Omi Province</a> and each one of the places in Settsu Province, Kawachi Province, Yamashiro Province and Ise Province. </p>
<p>Mumon-ginsen coins are made by cutting a silver plate and has no square hole that is characteristic of old coins but has a small round hole. 
<br/>Most Mumon-ginsen coins have no coins name inscriptions like '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Wado-kaichin.html">Wado-kaichin</a>,' but some Mumon-ginsen coins have inscriptions such as '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Koshi (Imperial Heir).html">Koshi</a>,' 'Ban' and 'Dai.'<br/>
Many Mumon-ginsen coins have pieces of silver pasted on to adjust the weight. </p>
<p>There is a view that Mumon-ginsen coins were silver coins circulated before Fuhonsen coins, because in "the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan).html">Nihonshoki</a>" (Chronicles of Japan) it says in 683, 'Do not use silver coins but use bronze coins hereafter.'<br/>
There is also an opinion that mintage of Mumon-ginsen coins had something to do with the fact that silver coins of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Wado-kaichin.html">Wado-kaichin</a> were issued before bronze <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Wado-kaichin.html">Wado-kaichin</a> coins. </p>
<p>And there is another view that silver coins were used around those times when the article of October 6, 486 in "the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan).html">Nihonshoki</a>" mentioned that 'one rice koku corresponds to one mon silver coin.'<br/>
