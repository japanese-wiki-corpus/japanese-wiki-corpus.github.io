<h1>The second battle of Kizugawaguchi (第二次木津川口の戦い)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The second battle of Kizugawaguchi was a naval battle between the Mori clan and the Oda clan that occurred on December 14, 1578. </p>
<p>Since <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Nobunaga ODA.html">Nobunaga ODA</a> suffered a major defeat in the first battle of Kizugawaguchi due to the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Horokuhiya.html">horokuhiya</a> (cooking-pot fire arrows) used by the Mori navy and the Murakami navy, he ordered Yoshitaka KUKI to build six bombproof armored warships equipped with ozutsu (a kind of cannon) and odeppo (Japanese hand culverin) in Ise Province. It is said that the size of the warships were 22 meters long and 12meters wide and it had incredible hugeness and defense power for that time. </p>
<p>The Oda navy led by Yoshitaka KUKI encountered the Mori navy which entered into Osaka Bay to support <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Ishiyama Hongan-ji Temple.html">Ishiyama Hongan-ji Temple</a> and had a naval battle with them, then 600 ships of the Mori navy and the Murakami navy suffered a crushing defeat before the power of ozutsu and odeppo loaded onto the Oda navy's six armored warships. Actually, it is considered that the Murakami navy of Noshima and Innoshima were too late for the battle and the Nomi navy and the Kodama navy made a decision in haste out of the wish be rewarded with merits, and suffered a major defeat. </p>
<p><h3>Result</h3>
</p>
<p>These are commonly accepted theories, but in recent studies the theory of the Mori navy's major defeat is questioned because the Mori navy conducted an operation to deliver provisions to the besieged Miki-jo Castle on a massive scale in the next year. As a result of this battle, the Oda navy gained naval supremacy of Osaka Bay, but the naval supremacy of the west area of Awaji-shima Island was still held by the Mori navy and it was just for a period of time when Michifusa KURUSHIMA seceded in March 1582 that the Oda clan took control of Awaji-shima Island and westward. </p>
<p>However, the delivery of provisions and weapons to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Ishiyama Hongan-ji Temple.html">Ishiyama Hongan-ji Temple</a> decreased after this naval battle and they felt demoralized. Two years after this battle, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kennyo.html">Kennyo</a> surrendered to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Nobunaga ODA.html">Nobunaga ODA</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Ishiyama Hongan-ji Temple.html">Ishiyama Hongan-ji Temple</a> was abandoned to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Nobunaga ODA.html">Nobunaga ODA</a>. </p>
