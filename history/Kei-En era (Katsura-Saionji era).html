<h1>Kei-En era (Katsura-Saionji era) (桂園時代)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kei-En era (or Kei-On era) was the 8-year period from 1905 to 1912 during which Taro KATSURA, who belonged to the faction led by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Aritomo YAMAGATA.html">Aritomo YAMAGATA</a> of the Imperial Japanese Army, and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kinmochi SAIONJI.html">Kinmochi SAIONJI</a>, who assumed the position of president of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Rikken seiyukai.html">Rikken seiyukai</a> (a political party) as a successor of Hirobumi ITO, gained power alternately. Kei-En' (桂園) was the combination of Kanji (Chinese characters) '桂' and '園' contained in their names. </p>
<p>In the Kei-En era, bureaucrats and military typified by Katsura and a leading political party <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Rikken seiyukai.html">Rikken seiyukai</a> typified by Saionji built a collaborative system called 'emotional agreement' and they alternately served as the prime minister (In the meantime, there was a move to field <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Masayoshi MATSUKATA.html">Masayoshi MATSUKATA</a>, Gonbei YAMAMOTO and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Tosuke HIRATA.html">Tosuke HIRATA</a> as prime minister, but none of them had stronger foundations of administration than those of the two, so they were forced to give up). This era is said to have been politically stable, and both the 10th general election of members of the House of Representatives and the 11th general election of members of the House of Representatives were held at the expiration of terms of office during this period. Only in this era, general elections at the expiration of terms of office were held twice in a row in the history of Japanese constitutional government. </p>
<p>In addition, the word 'Kei-En' has an another meaning, a name of a school of waka poetry. (the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Keien.html">Keien</a> school founded by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kageki KAGAWA.html">Kageki KAGAWA</a>, who was a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kajin (Waka or Tanka Poets).html">kajin</a> (waka poet) in the late Edo period. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Keien.html">Keien</a> was Kagawa's pseudonym.)<br/>
The <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Keien.html">Keien</a> school was a conservative school which valued tradition such as innocuous "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Kokin Wakashu (A Collection of Ancient and Modern Japanese Poetry).html">Kokin Wakashu</a>" (A Collection of Ancient and Modern Japanese Poetry) against venturous modern <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Tanka.html">tanka</a> which was coming into <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Fashion.html">fashion</a> at that time. Relating its innocuousness to the cozy relationship between Katsura and Saionji, the period was named Kei-En era. </p>
