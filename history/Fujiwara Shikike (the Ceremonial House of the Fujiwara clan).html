<h1>Fujiwara Shikike (the Ceremonial House of the Fujiwara clan) (藤原式家)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Fujiwara Shikike is a sub branch of Fujiwara family, started by <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/FUJIWARA no Umakai.html">FUJIWARA no Umakai</a>, the third son of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Udaijin (Minister of the Right).html">Udaijin</a> (Minister of the Right) <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/FUJIWARA no Fuhito.html">FUJIWARA no Fuhito</a>. The name of Shikike originated from the fact that Umakai was appointed as Shikibukyo (Minister of the Ministry of Ceremonial). </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>Umakai, founder of the Fujiwara Shikike, was promoted to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Sangi.html">sangi</a> (councilor) after the Conspiracy of Nagayao and led the government during the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Shomu.html">Emperor Shomu</a>'s era with other brothers, but he died of smallpox which spread in 737. <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/FUJIWARA no Hirotsugu.html">FUJIWARA no Hirotsugu</a>, the eldest son of Umakai and was demoted to Dazai no shoni (Junior Assistant Governor-General of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Dazai-fu (local government office in Kyushu region).html">Dazai-fu</a> offices) after his father's death, rose in revolt in Kyushu, known as the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Rebellion of FUJIWARA no Hirotsugu.html">Rebellion of FUJIWARA no Hirotsugu</a> in 740, but was killed in defeat. Due to these situations, Fujiwara Shikike had been subordinate to the so-called <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/family/Fujiwara Nanke (Fujiwara Nan Family).html">Fujiwara Nanke</a> (Southern House of the Fujiwara clan) led by <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/FUJIWARA no Toyonari.html">FUJIWARA no Toyonari</a> and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/FUJIWARA no Nakamaro.html">FUJIWARA no Nakamaro</a>, as well as the Fujiwara Hokke (Northern House of the Fujiwara clan) led by <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/FUJIWARA no Nagate.html">FUJIWARA no Nagate</a>, during the eras of Emperor Koken and Emperor Shotoku. </p>
<p><a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/FUJIWARA no Yoshitsugu.html">FUJIWARA no Yoshitsugu</a> and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/FUJIWARA no Momokawa.html">FUJIWARA no Momokawa</a>, younger brothers of Hirotsugu, were successful in helping <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Konin.html">Emperor Konin</a> to succeed Emperor Shotoku, and rose in the heart of the government instead of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Dokyo.html">Dokyo</a> and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/KIBI no Makibi.html">KIBI no Makibi</a>. Yoshitsugu and Momokawa also each married their daughters, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/FUJIWARA no Otomuro.html">FUJIWARA no Otomuro</a> and FUJIWARA no Tabiko, to Imperial Crown Prince Yamanobe (who later became Emperor Kanmu) and directed <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Kokyu (empresss residence).html">Kokyu</a> (empress's residence) policies. Both Yoshitsugu and Momokawa died before the enthronement of Emperor Kanmu, but Otomuro became empress and gave birth to Emperor Heizei and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Saga.html">Emperor Saga</a> while Tabiko became mother of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Junna.html">Emperor Junna</a>, building the base of prosperity of the Fujiwara Shikike during the early Heian period. During the Emperor Kanmu period, family members of Fujiwara Shikike were appointed to important positions; <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/FUJIWARA no Tamaro.html">FUJIWARA no Tamaro</a>, the forth son of Umakai, was promoted to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Sadaijin (Minister of the Left).html">Sadaijin</a> (Minister of the left) which was practically the highest position among vassals, while <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/FUJIWARA no Tanetsugu.html">FUJIWARA no Tanetsugu</a>, son of Umakai's third son <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/FUJIWARA no Kiyonari.html">FUJIWARA no Kiyonari</a>, was in charge of building <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Nagaoka-kyo (Nagaokakyo).html">Nagaoka-kyo</a> (Japan's short-lived eighth century capital). </p>
<p><a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/FUJIWARA no Otsugu.html">FUJIWARA no Otsugu</a>, son of Momokawa and younger brother of FUJIWARA no Tabiko (<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Nyogo (rank of court lady).html">nyogo</a> [a consort of an emperor]) of Emperor Kanmu), took charge of building <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Heian-kyo.html">Heian-kyo</a> (the ancient capital of Japan in current <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>) and proposed to suspend punitive expedition to Ezo after he was promoted to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Sangi.html">sangi</a> at the age of 29. During the Emperor Heizei era, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/FUJIWARA no Otsugu.html">FUJIWARA no Otsugu</a> worked on political reforms, including establishment of the system of inspecting local governments, and rose to higher positions during the era of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Junna.html">Emperor Junna</a> (emperor after Saga) as uncle of Emperor (mother of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Junna.html">Emperor Junna</a> was FUJIWARA no Tabiko, sister of Otsugu), eventually was appointed to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Udaijin (Minister of the Right).html">Udaijin</a> (Minister of the Right) and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Sadaijin (Minister of the Left).html">Sadaijin</a> (Minister of the Left) in a row. </p>
<p>However, Fujiwara Shikike gradually went under and was overwhelmed by Fujiwara Hokke after the era of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Saga.html">Emperor Saga</a>, partly due to the extinction of the Yoshitsugu family (maternal relatives to Emperor Heizei and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Saga.html">Emperor Saga</a>) caused by the death of FUJIWARA no Takumi, the only son of Yoshitsugu. Furthermore, the Kusuko Incident, a failed rebellion by <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/FUJIWARA no Nakanari.html">FUJIWARA no Nakanari</a> and his sister Kusuko who was a daughter of Tanetsugu and held power as <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Naishi.html">naishi</a> no <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Tsukasa (a rank in government offices).html">tsukasa</a> (a female palace attendant) for Emperor Heizei, as well as the rise of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/FUJIWARA no Fuyutsugu.html">FUJIWARA no Fuyutsugu</a> from Fujiwara Hokke who won trust of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Saga.html">Emperor Saga</a> and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/TACHIBANA no Kachiko.html">TACHIBANA no Kachiko</a>, also led to the decline of Shikike. </p>
<p>In addition, Hokke family won deep trust of the Retired <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Saga.html">Emperor Saga</a> and Empress Dowager, shown by the fact that Fuyutsugu's son, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/FUJIWARA no Yoshifusa.html">FUJIWARA no Yoshifusa</a>, got married with <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/MINAMOTO no Kiyohime.html">MINAMOTO no Kiyohime</a>, Imperial princess of the Retired <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Saga.html">Emperor Saga</a>, while Shikike family failed to produce influential figures due to incidents such as the death of FUJIWARA no Ieo, the eldest son of Otsugu. </p>
<p>Otsugu still eventually maintained the head seat of Taikaku (cabinet) more than 15 years after the death of Fuyutsugu during the eras of Emperors Junna and Ninmyo, while his cousin's son <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/FUJIWARA no Yoshino.html">FUJIWARA no Yoshino</a> also left accomplishments as a local officer, and was promoted to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Chunagon.html">Chunagon</a> (vice-councilor of state). However, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Yoshino.html">Yoshino</a> lost his position during the Jowa Incident, and right after the downfall of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Yoshino.html">Yoshino</a>, Otsugu died, making Shikike step aside the center of the politics afterwards. </p>
<p>Thereafter, Fujiwara Shikike produced <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/FUJIWARA no Tadabumi.html">FUJIWARA no Tadabumi</a>, who put down <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/FUJIWARA no Sumitomo.html">FUJIWARA no Sumitomo</a>'s War, and FUJIWARA no Sukeyo, who was involved with the Ako Incident, but from the middle of the Heian period, only a couple of families managed to keep their lines known as those that rose on the basis of Confucianism, and few could remain until the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period. However, Endo family, one of the lines of Settsu Watanabe-to Party, represented themselves as descendant of Fujiwara Shikike. <h3>Family</h3>
