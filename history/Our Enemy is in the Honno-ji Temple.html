<h1>Our Enemy is in the Honno-ji Temple (敵は本能寺にあり)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>"Our Enemy is in the Honno-ji Temple" is allegedly the phrase uttered by Mitsuhide AKECHI, busho (Japanese military commander) in the Warring States period, during the Honnoji Incident. Although Mitsuhide's troops were ordered to attack the Mori clan in Bicchu Province by his lord Nobunaga ODA, he suddely changed his path saying that his enemy was Nobunaga himself in Honnno-ji Temple and headed towards Honnno-ji Temple in Kyoto. There is a theory that the phrase was made up by someone else after ages but it has become so widely known that it has been quoted in many novels and used as the title of a movie and a drama. </p>
