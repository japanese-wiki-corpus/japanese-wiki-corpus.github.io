<h1>Fuyusoden (不輸租田)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Fuyusoden was a rice field exempted from tax according to the Japanese <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ritsuryo.html">ritsuryo</a> system (a system of centralized government based on the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ritsuryo.html">ritsuryo</a> code). </p>
<p>Fuyusoden mainly included <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shinden.html">shinden</a> (also referred to as kamita, kanda) which was a paddy field affiliated with a shrine, jiden (also referred to as terada) which was a paddy field affiliated with a temple, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kanden (imperial estates).html">kanden</a> (imperial estates) which was a paddy field allotted according to government rank, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Chokushiden.html">chokushiden</a> (imperial proprietorships and land), and kugaiden (estates belonging to government officers.)<br/>
It originated when the government made the tax payers directly transport their land taxes (rice) to the government officials and temples and shrines through the government. </p>
<p>In the mid Heian period, kaihatsu ryoshu (local nobles who actually developed the land) began to donate their land to temples or high-ranking aristocrats in order to make their land fuyusoden (donated-type of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> [manor]); however, they were required to submit <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kugen (legal certificate).html">kugen</a> (official documents authorized by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kokushi.html">kokushi</a> [provincial governor] or <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Gunji.html">Gunji</a> [local magistrate] for transfer of the ownership of private property) consisting of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Daijokanpu.html">daijokanpu</a> (official document issued by Daijokan, Grand Council of State) and minbushofu (official document issued by the minister of minbusho) based on the chokkyo (the imperial sanction) to have their land designated as fuyusoden -- <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shoen.html">Shoen</a> which consisted of fuyusoden with the complete set of documents submitted was called Kanshofu sho (a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> enjoying immunity from taxation by virtue of having official documents from both the Council of State and the Ministry of Popular Affairs), and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> which was virtually treated as fuyusoden merely with approval of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kokushi.html">kokushi</a> was called kokumen <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> (provincially exempted <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a>). Since the Kanshofu sho was the only fuyusoden and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> with government approval, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> without <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kugen (legal certificate).html">kugen</a> submitted (especially, kokumen <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a>) was eliminated for consolidation purposes when Manor Regulation Acts were issued. </p>
