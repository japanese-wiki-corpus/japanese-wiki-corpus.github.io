<h1>Jimoku (ceremony for appointing officials) (除目)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Jimoku (aka Jomoku) refers to a ceremony to appoint officials of kyokan (an official of the Capital) and gekan (a provincial official) after the mid Heian period. It also refers to an annual event in the Imperial Court, a ceremony for appointing officials itself, as well as a book listing the names of appointed officials (also referred as Josho). Ji or jo means removing the former official and appointing a new one, and moku means recording in a list. </p>
<p>The ceremony for appointing was an annual event that was usually performed in the spring and the autumn, which were called haru no jimoku and aki no jimoku. In addition, small irregular jimoku was performed as needed. For the ceremony of jimoku, very minute rules were established through the event, including the way of a sheet of paper was to be folded and the way in which caked ink was scrubbed. </p>
