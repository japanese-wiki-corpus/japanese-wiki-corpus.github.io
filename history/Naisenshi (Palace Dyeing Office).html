<h1>Naisenshi (Palace Dyeing Office) (内染司)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Naisenshi was an institution belonging to Kunaisho (Ministry of the Sovereign's Household) in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ritsuryo.html">Ritsuryo</a> system (a system of centralized government based on the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ritsuryo.html">ritsuryo</a> code). 
<br/>The Japanese way of reading is 'Uchisomemono no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Tsukasa (a rank in government offices).html">tsukasa</a>.'<br/>
</p>
<p><h3>Official duties</h3>
</p>
<p>Naisenshi was in charge of dyeing for string, fabric and woven fabric to be dedicated to the Emperor and the Empress. Kannuhi (government-owned slave) were staffed for dyeing. With the elimination and consolidation of government officials on February 23, 808, it was incorporated into <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Nuidonoryo.html">Nuidonoryo</a> (Bureau of the Wardrobe and Court Ladies) belonging to Nakatsukasasho (Ministry of Central Affairs) (the said part of "Nihon Koki" (Later Chronicle of Japan) was partly lost, but it was written in "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kanshoku (Government Post).html">Kanshoku</a> hisho" (a text describing rules of ceremony and etiquette to be observed in the imperial court and by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> that was written during the early Heian period in around 1200) and so on. In the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Engishiki.html">Engishiki</a> (an ancient book for codes and procedures on national rites and prayers), 'Gofukusome tsukuridokoro' (the center for dyeing clothes), which succeeded to the function of Naisenshi, was put in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Nuidonoryo.html">Nuidonoryo</a> and six Somete (dyer), who seems to have been later forms of Someshi (dyer), were staffed. <h3>Personnel</h3>
