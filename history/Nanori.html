<h1>Nanori (名乗り)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kanji character readings used in Japanese people's names which differ from the standard on-yomi (Sino-Japanese reading) and kun-yomi (native Japanese reading). </p>
<p>A practice performed in battle. Described in this article. </p>
<p>Nanori was a loud statement made by a samurai to an opponent in which he announced his full name, status, family lineage and assertion for the conflict. Samurai propriety did not allow them to attack while nanori was taking place. </p>
<p>Nanori was performed in order to show the legitimacy of attacking an opponent as well as to boost moral of allies during battle. </p>
<p>It stated to become frequently performed from around the end of the Heian period but became obsolete as combat shifted toward group battles using firearms. </p>
