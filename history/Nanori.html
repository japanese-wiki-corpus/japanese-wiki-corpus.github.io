<h1>Nanori (名乗り)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kanji character readings used in Japanese people's names which differ from the standard on-yomi (Sino-Japanese reading) and kun-yomi (native Japanese reading). </p>
<p>A practice performed in battle. Described in this article. </p>
<p>Nanori was a loud statement made by a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> to an opponent in which he announced his full name, status, family lineage and assertion for the conflict. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">Samurai</a> propriety did not allow them to attack while nanori was taking place. </p>
<p>Nanori was performed in order to show the legitimacy of attacking an opponent as well as to boost moral of allies during battle. </p>
<p>It stated to become frequently performed from around the end of the Heian period but became obsolete as combat shifted toward group battles using firearms. </p>
