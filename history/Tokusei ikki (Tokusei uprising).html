<h1>Tokusei ikki (Tokusei uprising) (徳政一揆)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>A Tokusei uprising is a type of peasant uprising. The purpose of these uprisings was for a proclamation of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Tokuseirei.html">Tokuseirei</a> (ordering the return of sold land and a dissolution of debts). </p>
<p>Tokusei uprisings frequently occurred during the Muromachi period beginning with the Shocho no doikki (peasant uprising of the Shocho era) in 1429 which took a long time to subside. A famous uprising among "Tokusei ikki" was the one that occurred during the Kakitsu era. Among the various causes behind a Tokusei ikki include poor harvests, infectious diseases, a declining population and a lack of trust in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>. Participants in an uprising included bashaku (shipping agents who used horses), <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Toiya.html">toiya</a> (warehouse merchants) and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Toimaru (specialized wholesale merchant).html">toimaru</a> (specialized wholesale merchants). </p>
