<p>This section describes the history of architecture in Japan. </p>
<p>See the section on "Japanese Housing" for details about the architectural history of Japanese houses, and the section on "Shrine Architecture" for details about shrines. </p>
<p><h3>Origins of 'Architectural History of Japan.'</h3>
</p>
<p>The study of architecture has been conducted since the Edo period as part of greater studies on the practices of ancient court and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> families, but it was only in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period that architectural study emerged as an independent branch of learning (the term 'kenchiku' [建築], meaning 'architecture', was itself coined in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period). It is said that Kingo TATSUNO, an early Japanese architect, was once asked about Japanese architectural history whilst studying abroad in London, and, having completely failed to answer the question, he felt a compelling need for a study on the subject. The first step in the study of Japanese architectural history occurred when one of Tatsuno's students, Chuta ITO, academically proved that Horyu-ji Temple was Japan's oldest structure. The manuscript "A Shortened History of Japan's Fine Arts," published in 1900 to coincide with Japan's participation in the world's fair in Paris, was compiled chiefly by Tenshin OKAKURA with Chuta ITO in charge of the architecture section; it was strongly influenced by Tenshin's method of classifying the history of fine arts and his established framework of architectural history. A key issue in those days was the protection of temple architecture, as many temples had been badly affected by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Haibutsu-kishaku (a movement to abolish Buddhism).html">haibutsu-kishaku</a> (the anti-Buddhist movement in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> era that resulted in the destruction of many Buddhist temples), and so Tadashi SEKINO conducted field research to record the year of construction of the major buildings located in Nara and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. Historians and scholars of architectural history were in dispute about the year of construction of Horyu-ji Temple (and whether or not the temple had been rebuilt), which led to a more in-depth study of Japan's architectural history using methods such as archaeological excavation and surveying remnants of ancient structures, examining the styles of existing buildings and studying literature such as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Rikkokushi (the Six National Histories).html">Rikkokushi</a> (Japan's six national histories). <h3>Scope of Japan's architectural history</h3>
</p>
<p>Until World War II, studies focused on ancient and medieval shrine and temple architecture, but since the War, the scope of research widened to include shrines and temples of the Edo period and modern structures from and since the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period (studies during and after the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period included the study of structures left behind by ex-colonies that were constructed by Japanese architects). There is growing interest in old buildings with no particular significance; a small roadside shrine, for instance, is a valuable symbol of local history. <h3>Positioning and characteristics of Japan's architecture</h3>
</p>
<p>Japanese architecture has developed with influences from the Korean Peninsula and China. Since the modern era, western culture has also had an influence, but at the same time, a unique Japanese style of architecture has developed that is integrated with the natural environment and culture of Japan. </p>
<p>Japanese architecture, which mainly uses posts and beams, differs from Western architecture of bricks and stones, and traditional Japanese architecture gained attention in 20th century architectural modernism since it was ahead of its time in the use of modern architectural concepts. <h3>Primitive period</h3>
</p>

Yoshinogari site<br/>
</p>
<p>The number of sites that are restored based on the results of excavation are increasing. The Sannai-Maruyama site of the Jomon period has revealed the fact that the architectural technology of the time was surprisingly high. <h3>Architecture of ancient times</h3>

During the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Asuka (飛鳥 in Chinese characters, the name of present-day Asuka Village, Nara Prefecture).html">Asuka</a> and Nara periods, Japan adopted architectural techniques from China and the Korean Peninsula. The construction of temples also began after the official introduction of Buddhism to Japan in 538. Records show that temple carpenters and makers of Buddhist images and artifacts were invited from Paekche in 577. Also known as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Hoko-ji Temple.html">Hoko-ji Temple</a> or <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Gango-ji Temple.html">Gango-ji Temple</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Asuka-dera Temple.html">Asuka-dera Temple</a> (Asuka-mura Village, Takaichi-gun, Nara Prefecture), which was built by the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Asuka (飛鳥 in Chinese characters, the name of present-day Asuka Village, Nara Prefecture).html">Asuka</a> clan in the period from 588 to 609, and Shitenno-ji Temple (Tennoji, Tennoji-ku, Osaka City, Osaka Prefecture), which is said to have been founded by Prince Shotoku, are believed to be the oldest Japanese Buddhist temples (the original building not existing in either case). The oldest temples that exist in their original structure are <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Saiin (the Priestess or the residence of the Priestess).html">Saiin</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Garan.html">Garan</a> (Western Precinct Complex consisting of Naka-mon Gate, Five-Story Pagoda, Kon-do Hall, Dai-Ko-do Hall, etc.) of Horyu-ji Temple and the Three-Story Pagoda of Hokki-ji Temple (both located in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Ikaruga-cho.html">Ikaruga-cho</a>, Ikoma-gun, Nara Prefecture). <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Saiin (the Priestess or the residence of the Priestess).html">Saiin</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Garan.html">Garan</a> of Horyu-ji Temple was once believed to have been built in the age of Prince Shotoku, but it is now considered, thanks to the development of research in the modern times, that the complex was destroyed by fire in 670 and rebuilt sometime between the late seventh and early eighth century. The Three-Story Pagoda of Hokki-ji Temple was built in the early eighth century. It should be noted that the building techniques and positioning of Buddhist temples at that time reflect the style of temples in Paekche. The influence of Chinese architectural style grew during the Sui and Tong Dynasties when Japanese envoys were sent to China. </p>
<p>During the aristocratic era of the Heian period, architectural style came to possess typically Japanese features, where rooms creating a serene atmosphere with thinner pillars and lower ceilings were preferred. During and after the Heian period, a unique Japanese style of architecture developed called Wayo Kenchiku (Japanese-style architecture). <h3>Architecture of the medieval period</h3>
</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period<br/>
Restoration of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Todai-ji Temple.html">Todai-ji Temple</a> and construction of Jodo-ji Temple (Ono City) (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Daibutsu-yo (Great Buddha Style).html">Daibutsu-yo</a> [Buddhist architectural style] which is also known as Tenjiku-yo [India style], Chogen SHUNJOBO)<br/>
<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Zenshu-yo (Zen Sect Style).html">Zenshu-yo</a> (Zen style Buddhist architecture which is also known as Kara-yo [Chinese style]) (Zen Buddha hall)<br/>
Buddha Hall at <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Kozan-ji Temple.html">Kozan-ji Temple</a>, Syakamuni Hall of Zenpuku-in Temple<br/>
Buke-zukuri (Common term for the style of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> houses in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period)<br/>
The Muromachi period<br/>
Kinkaku (golden pavilion) of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Rokuon-ji Temple.html">Rokuon-ji Temple</a> (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Shinden-zukuri.html">Shinden-zukuri</a> style + Zen sect), Ginkaku (silver pavilion) of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Jisho-ji Temple.html">Jisho-ji Temple</a> (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Shoin-zukuri.html">Shoin-zukuri</a> style [a traditional residential style of Japanese architecture that includes a display alcove known as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Tokonoma (alcove in a traditional Japanese room where art or flowers are displayed).html">tokonoma</a>] + Zen Buddha hall)<br/>
<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Shuden-zukuri style.html">Shuden-zukuri style</a> (Shuden: the main residential building within a walled compound)<br/>
</p>
<p>As trading with China increased in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period, Chinese architectural styles were re-introduced into Japan. The style brought to Japan first was one which was utilized in the restoration of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Todai-ji Temple.html">Todai-ji Temple</a> (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Daibutsu-yo (Great Buddha Style).html">Daibutsu-yo</a> or Tenjiku-yo). </p>
<p><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Todai-ji Temple.html">Todai-ji Temple</a> and the statue of Birushana Buddha, both built in the Tenpyo era, were destroyed by fire during the Jisho-Juei War which took place at the end of the Heian period. Chogen SHUNJOBO consecrated the newly made Great Buddha image in 1185 after overcaming numerous obstacles in its construction. The Great Buddha Hall was rebuilt in 1195. A grand memorial service was held in 1203 (see the section on "Todai-ji Temple Birushana Buddha Statue"). </p>
<p>The architectural style of the Great Buddha Hall and other similar reconstructions by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Chogen.html">Chogen</a> was quite unique and is said to have commonalities with the architectural style of Fujian Province and the surrounding area of China in those days (the Sung dynasty). </p>
<p>Although the architectural style, incorporating rational structure and a bold design, was suitable for the Great Buddha Hall, it was incompatible with the Japanese preference for a serene space, and so <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Daibutsu-yo (Great Buddha Style).html">Daibutsu-yo</a> lost popularity after the death of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Chogen.html">Chogen</a>. The craftsmen who were engaged in the restoration of the Great Buddha Hall moved to various places after that project and a new Japanese architectural style, known as Setchu-yo (cross style) was born with the influence of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Daibutsu-yo (Great Buddha Style).html">Daibutsu-yo</a>. </p>
<p>Thereafter, Zen monks actively travelled between Japan and China, which led to the introduction of Chinese temple architecture to Japan. This is often used in the Buddha halls of Zen sect temples (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Zenshu-yo (Zen Sect Style).html">Zenshu-yo</a> or Kara-yo). <h3>Architecture of early modern times</h3>
</p>
<p>The Azuchi-Momoyama period<br/>
Completion of castle architecture and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Shoin-zukuri.html">Shoin-zukuri</a> style<br/>
- Himeji-jo Castle, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Hikone-jo Castle.html">Hikone-jo Castle</a>, Matsumoto-jo Castle, Inuyama-jo Castle, etc. 
<br/><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Chashitsu (tea-ceremony room).html">Chashitsu</a> (tea room)<br/>
</p>
<p>In cultural history, the Momoyama period often refers to the time between 1573 when the Muromachi shogunate fell and 1615 when the Toyotomi family was overthrown. During this period, castle architecture was developed; castle towers were built as a symbolic representation of power and splendid paintings were drawn on partitions to represent the era of unification of the country. Tea ceremonies, which started in the Muromachi period, were developed to perfection by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/SEN no Rikyu.html">SEN no Rikyu</a> and a new architectural style for <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Chashitsu (tea-ceremony room).html">chashitsu</a> (tea room) was born. </p>

Private houses<br/>
</p>
<p>In the Edo period, when more popular culture flourished, a clear tendency towards secularism is also observed in the field of architecture. An example of this movement is the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Sukiya-zukuri.html">Sukiya-zukuri</a> style, where <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Chashitsu (tea-ceremony room).html">chashitsu</a> features were incorporated into residential structures as well as urban entertainment facilities such as theaters and brothels. Private houses also developed gradually, adopting the features of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Shoin-zukuri.html">Shoin-zukuri</a> style in part. In the sector of temple architecture, large hondos (main halls), such as that of Zenko-ji Temple and Senso-ji Temple, were built to accommodate a large number of worshippers. <h3>Architecture of modern times</h3>

Bunri-ha Kenchikukai (the Secession school of architects)<br/>
Architectural modernism<br/>
</p>
<p>Residences, trading houses and churches for foreign residents were built in the foreign settlements which were established in the final days of the Tokugawa shogunate. The Glover Mansion, standing on a high <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Point (Sentoki).html">point</a> in Nagasaki, was built by Japanese people under instruction from Glover, but there were also some structures that were constructed by visiting foreign engineers. Inspired by these new structures in the foreign settlements, Japanese builders began to construct Western-style houses and buildings (Gi-yofu Kenchiku). </p>
<p>In the early <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period, the Japanese government was making desperate attempts to acquire Western architectural technologies in order to develop the cities required to modernize the country. Thomas WALTERS and Josiah CONDER were invited to Japan as foreign specialists in government service. 
<br/>Conder put his efforts into training Japanese architects at the Imperial College of Engineering and was therefore referred to as 'Father of Japanese architectural studies.'<br/>
Kingo TATSUNO was one of the first graduates of the university. </p>
<p>With a plan to construct numerous government offices and realizing the need to develop specialists in the field of architecture, the Japanese government sought assistance from the German government, an advanced European nation that the Japanese admired. The architectural design firm of Hermann ENDE and Wilhelm BECKMANN (Baufirma Ende & Boeckmann) was selected to assist with the project, and the two men were sent to Japan. Based on Ende and Beckmann's suggestion that some delegates be sent to Germany to study and acquire the necessary techniques required for building a modern state, the Japanese government sent a learning mission to Germany consisting of 20 young Japanese people including Yorinaka TSUMAKI, Yuzuru WATANABE, Kozo KAWAI and 17 senior workmen who specialized in stonemasonry, carpentry, artificial stonemasonry, brick-laying, painting, roofing and plastering. A good deal of knowledge was gained from the three-year mission and, after returning to Japan, many of the delegates played an important part in architectural circles, some became artists, while others became the first graduates of what is now known as the Tokyo Institute of Technology. Kotaro SAKURAI deserved a special mention as the first Japanese person to obtain a licence as an authorized British architect in 1892 after studying abroad at London University. </p>
<p>Architecture was always considered a technology of modernization which was to be learned from the West and the concept of architecture as art has not developed in Japan<br/>
A great deal of damage was caused to brick buildings during the Nobi Earthquake and the Great Kanto Earthquake, which led to the development of quake-resistant technologies which are unique to Japan. As a result, there developed a tendency to view architecture solely as an engineering concept. This view still persists today. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, in 1920, the mid Taisho era, the first Japanese architectural design movement was beginning with a group of graduates from the Department of Architecture of Tokyo Imperial University including Sutemi HORIGUCHI, Mamoru YAMADA, Kikuji ISHIDA, Keiichi MORITA and Mayumi TAKIZAWA; it was called Bunri-ha Kenchikukai. <h3>Contemporary architecture</h3>
</p>
<p>See the section on "Nihon Kindai Kenchikushi" (History of Japan's Modern Architecture) for the time line. </p>
<p>Having taken a severe blow during the Second World War, the Japanese architectural movement found opportunities for development during the postwar restoration and periods of high economic growth. The use of ferroconcrete became common and public facilities everywhere were being built in the modern architectural style. Frequent earthquakes was a problem in Japan, but, as quake-resistant technologies improved, the height restriction of 100 <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Shaku.html">shaku</a> (31m) was eased and more high-rise buildings were constructed. Japan began to foster many internationally renowned architects such as Kenzo TANGE, Fumihiko MAKI and Tadao ANDO, and the standard of modern architecture in Japan improved. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Apart (Apartment).html">apart</a> from some architects in the Taisho and early Showa periods, the concept of scenic beauty in cities was all but lost during wartime and the postwar restoration periods. Many of the traditional cityscapes and beautiful old buildings and structures were lost in the war or during the economic growth, and there was a growing number of cheap structures that emphasized economic rationality and repeated "scrap and build" constructions. People began to voice concerns that Japanese cities had became ugly, and so some measures were taken, such as the allocation of preservation districts for groups of historic buildings and the development of Landscape Law, which emphasizes the aesthetics of cities and land. <h3>Researchers of Japanese architectural history</h3>
