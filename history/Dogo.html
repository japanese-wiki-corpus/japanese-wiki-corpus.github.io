<h1>Dogo (土豪)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>In a broad sense, dogo refers to 'specific small local clans' as opposed to large regional clans which control wide territories. </p>
<p>Dogo is a historical term that frequently appears in relation to the Muromachi period and the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Sengoku Period (period of warring states) (Japan).html">Sengoku Period</a> (Period of Warring States) but when used in reference to the period of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yamato.html">Yamato</a> dynasty, it refers to kuninomiyatsuko (provincial governor) class of local heads. </p>
<p>The following mainly pertains to dogo in Japan particularly during the middle ages. </p>
<p><h3>The Class that Served as Farmers and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">Samurai</a> such as jizamurai (local <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a>)</h3>
</p>
<p>Ancient sources refer to them as 'jizamurai' or 'myoji no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Hyakusho.html">hyakusho</a>' (farmers with surnames). It means that they were low-ranking <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> who served as both warriors and farmers. As the separation of farmers and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> took place, weaker <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> families came to be called 'dogo' (narrow sense). <h3>Those including the lords of manors of Jizamurai</h3>
</p>
<p>In wider sense, while larger <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Gozoku (local ruling family).html">gozoku</a> (local ruling families) had a large power to reign some counties in his assigned region whether he stayed in the center or the local, dogo was a retainer or <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Hikan (low ranking clerks).html">hikan</a> (low-level bureaucrat) of jito, who were usually smaller <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Gozoku (local ruling family).html">gozoku</a> and reigned some villages which were under control of or independent from the larger <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Gozoku (local ruling family).html">gozoku</a>, or <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kokujin.html">kokujin</a> ryoshu (local <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> lord) of the jito's linage, and even included zaichi-ryoshu (local lord) which was to be the main stream of jizamurai. </p>
