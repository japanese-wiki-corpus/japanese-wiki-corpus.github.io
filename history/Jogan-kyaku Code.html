<h1>Jogan-kyaku Code (貞観格)</h1>
<p>Also, changes were made by deleting the laws of which some parts were not used and the specific phrases which modified the laws. </p>
<p>Jogan-kyaku Code was one of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kyakushiki.html">Kyakushiki</a> codes (amendments and enforcement regulations of the Ritsuryo Code) that was submitted to the Emperor on May 31, 869, and was enforced on October 19 the same year with the imperial decree. It consists of 12 volumes, of which the last 2 volumes were appendicies of temporary acts 'Rinji-kaku' (lit. temporary codes) by modeling a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Kaigen (Eye-Opening).html">Kaigen</a> temporary code of the Tang Dynasty in China. </p>
<p><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Yoshimi.html">FUJIWARA no Yoshimi</a>, who received the Imperial order, started the compilation and after his death, mainly <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Ujimune.html">FUJIWARA no Ujimune</a> compiled it. Following 'Konin-kyaku Code,' they chose from Shochoku (imperial edicts) and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Daijokanpu.html">Daijokanpu</a> (official documents from the Department of State to local governments) significant laws which had been enforced for 49 years (820-868) and arranged them according to each ministry. </p>
<p>During compilation, the laws that had been already shown in the 'Konin-kyaku Code' or had been abolished at the time were removed. </p>
<p>The original text of the 'Jogan-kyaku Code' was lost, however, many phrases are quoted in the "Ruiju sandai kaku" (Assorted regulations from Three Reigns) and "Seiji Yoryaku" (Brief Outline of Government) by KOREMUNE no Masasuke. Therefore, a large part of the contents of the Jogan-kyaku Code can be inferred. </p>
