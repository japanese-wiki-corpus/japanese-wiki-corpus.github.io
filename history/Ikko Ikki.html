<h1>Ikko Ikki (一向一揆)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Ikko ikki (literally, "Ikko-sect riot") is a general term for riots during Japan's Sengoku period (period of warring states) (Japan) caused by followers of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Hongan-ji Temple.html">Hongan-ji Temple</a> branch within the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Jodo Shinshu.html">Jodo Shinshu</a> sect (the True Pure Land Sect of Buddhism), which was also called the "Ikko" or "only one direction (to heaven)" sect. </p>
<p>In an effort to avoid disturbances, the leadership of the Jodo Shinshu Honganji organization organized its followers of warriors, farmers, and craftsmen/merchants, thereby instituting a religiously based autonomous government over them. In 1488, after the Ikko ikki destroyed the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a> (military governor) of Kaga Province, Masachika TOGASHI, society learned of their great power. Until the last days of the Sengoku period, when the Ikko ikki were finally suppressed by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Nobunaga ODA.html">Nobunaga ODA</a> and others, Ikko ikki managed to set up and govern peaceful, prosperous neighborhoods all over the country. Because their main strongholds, including Osaka in Settsu Province, Nagashima-cho in Ise Province (Mie Prefecture today), and the Yahagi-gawa River basin in Mikawa Province were all in the low-lying wetlands, some have suggested the Ikko ikki may have developed advanced flood control techniques (without which it would have been difficult to create prosperous communities in such flood-prone areas). </p>
<p>The Ikko ikki initiated dozens of large-scale assaults (including the Battle of Kuzuryu-gawa River) in an attempt to restore their control over Yoshizaki-gobo Temple in Echizen Province, which had been usurped by the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/family/Asakura clan.html">Asakura clan</a>, and later, they fought with such powerful men as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Nobunaga ODA.html">Nobunaga ODA</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Harumoto HOSOKAWA.html">Harumoto HOSOKAWA</a>, who had begun to fear that the sheer size of the Ikko riots (ikki) threatened to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shake.html">shake</a> the very foundations of warrior rule; in the end, the Ikko ikki itself became somewhat analogous to Sengoku <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> (Japanese territorial lord in the Sengoku period), and fought for hegemony over Japan. </p>
<p>But in 1580, when their resistance to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Nobunaga ODA.html">Nobunaga ODA</a> was quelled, the Ikko (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Jodo Shinshu.html">Jodo Shinshu</a>) sect patriarch, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kennyo.html">Kennyo</a>, was forced to flee the Ikko stronghold of Osaka, and thereafter a rift appeared in the power structure of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Hongan-ji Temple.html">Hongan-ji Temple</a> itself, and from that <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Point (Sentoki).html">point</a> on one heard of Ikko ikki no more. </p>
