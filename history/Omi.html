<h1>Omi (臣)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Shin (臣) refers to a retainer who served his lord. Also, it is how a retainer would call himself. </p>
<p>Shin (臣) refers to one of the radicals of Chinese character. Refer to Shinbu (a group list of Chinese characters classified by the radicals). </p>
<p>Shin SUZUKI (real name) was a guitarist of the former rock group Kuroyume. He left the group on February 15, 1995. </p>
<p>Omi (臣) indicates one of kabane (hereditary title to denote rank and political standing) used in the Yamato sovereignty (the ancient Japan sovereignty). It is described in this article. Omi was one of kabane used in the Yamato sovereignty and denoted the highest ranked title along with Muraji. </p>
<p>Originally, Omi was granted to the local ruling clans who were subjected to the Yamato sovereignty around Kinai region (the five capital provinces surrounding the ancient capitals of Nara and Kyoto). The local ruling clans such as Soga, Kose, Ki, Heguri, Kazuraki and Hata who played a central role in the Yamato sovereignty had this title of Omi. Also, influential local ruling clans in other areas were allowed to call themselves Omi. </p>
<p>According to the "Nihonshoki" (Chronicles of Japan), many clans with the kabane of Omi were descended from the emperors before the period of the Emperor Keitai. Furthermore, the Soga clan and seven influential others could be descended from TAKENOUCHI no Sukune. </p>
<p>Ancient written documents include descriptions of Omi written in 使主 instead of 臣. </p>
<p>The most influential people among the clans with the kabane of Omi were called Oomi, who was put in charge of the affairs of state. On the other hand, those among the clans with the kabane of Muraji were called Omuraji. </p>
<p>By the Yakusa no Kabane (the eight honorary titles) reform by the Emperor Tenmu, the kabane of Omi was demoted to the sixth highest, and afterwards Ason (or Asomi) became the kabane title for influential clans. After introducing a new system of Yakusa no Kabane, Omi stopped being granted. </p>
