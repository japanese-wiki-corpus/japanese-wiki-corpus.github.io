<h1>Eikyu no goso (永久の強訴)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The Eikyu no goso was a collective petition to the Imperial Court by a few thousand monks at the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Kofuku-ji Temple.html">Kofuku-ji Temple</a> on May 14, 1113, requesting Ensei, a sculptor of Buddhist statues who became a priest at <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Enryaku-ji Temple.html">Enryaku-ji Temple</a> and was appointed to the position of the betto (the superior of a temple) of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Kiyomizu-dera Temple.html">Kiyomizu-dera Temple</a>, a branch temple of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Kofuku-ji Temple.html">Kofuku-ji Temple</a>, be dismissed from the position. </p>
<p>Ensei led the construction of Buddhist statues at the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Hossho-ji Temple.html">Hossho-ji Temple</a> and the Sonsho-ji Temple, and because of this, the aggressive <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Appointment (Ninkan).html">appointment</a> was processed as if it had been a reward for his service to the Cloistered Emperor <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Shirakawa (the surroundings of the old capital, Kyoto).html">Shirakawa</a>. The Cloistered Emperor <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Shirakawa (the surroundings of the old capital, Kyoto).html">Shirakawa</a> yielded to the petition, and thus the petition was expected to stop; however, monks for the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Enryaku-ji Temple.html">Enryaku-ji Temple</a> took retaliatory action on May 23 because monks for the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Kofuku-ji Temple.html">Kofuku-ji Temple</a> beat the jinin (associates of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> shrines) of the Gion-sha Shrine when visiting the capital. They destroyed small and large buildings of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Kiyomizu-dera Temple.html">Kiyomizu-dera Temple</a>, carried the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Mikoshi (Portable shrine).html">mikoshi</a> (portable shrine carried in festivals), and burst into the oidono (kitchen hall), In-Gosho (the imperial palace for retired and cloistered emperors), to demand that the gon shosozu (Junior lesser prelate) Jikkaku should be banished. The governor of Dewa Province, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Mitsukuni.html">MINAMOTO no Mitsukuni</a>, the governor of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Tango Province.html">Tango Province</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/TAIRA no Masamori.html">TAIRA no Masamori</a>, and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Saemon no jo (Government Post).html">Saemon no jo</a> (third-ranked officer of the Left Division of Outer Palace Guards) <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Tameyoshi.html">MINAMOTO no Tameyoshi</a> guarded the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Dairi (the Imperial palace).html">dairi</a> (Imperial Palace) and In-Gosho. </p>
<p>The <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Kofuku-ji Temple.html">Kofuku-ji Temple</a> was outraged by the Cloistered Emperor <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Shirakawa (the surroundings of the old capital, Kyoto).html">Shirakawa</a>'s makeshift handling of the situation and acceptance of the request to punish Jikkaku, and submitted to the Emperor the three pleas that <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Tendai-zasu.html">Tendai-zasu</a> (head priest of the Tendai sect) Ningo and Head priest of Hossho-ji Temple Kankei be banished; that the Gion-sha Shrine be a subordinate shrine of the Kasuga-taisha Shrine; and that Jikkaku's banishment be halted. To prevent monks from entering the capital, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/TAIRA no Masamori.html">TAIRA no Masamori</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/TAIRA no Tadamori.html">TAIRA no Tadamori</a> and MINAMOTO no Shigetoki were deployed to Uji, and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Mitsukuni.html">MINAMOTO no Mitsukuni</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Morishige.html">FUJIWARA no Morishige</a> to Nishi-Sakamoto. When both of the sides faced each other in Uji, a deer, which was believed to be a messenger from the deity of the Kasuga-taisha Shrine, appeared in front of them; one solder tried to shoot it and this incident caused the battle to begin, resulting in a large number of casualties among the side of the monks. Masamori, Tadamori and Shigetoki, who were deployed to Uji, were the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kebiishi (police and judicial chief).html">kebiishi</a> (police and judicial chief), but they were ordered to be deployed by the Cloistered Emperor <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Shirakawa (the surroundings of the old capital, Kyoto).html">Shirakawa</a> without an instruction from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Munetada.html">FUJIWARA no Munetada</a>, the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kebiishi (police and judicial chief).html">kebiishi</a> no betto (Superintendent of the Imperial Police). This incident showed that the Kebiishicho (Office of Police and Judicial Chief) and various efu (Palace Guards) were losing substance while the In no hokumen (Imperial Palace Guards) were gaining more power. </p>
