<h1>Fujiwara Kyoke (the Capital House of the Fujiwara clan) (藤原京家)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Fujiwara Kyoke is a sub branch of Fujiwara family, started by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/FUJIWARA no Maro.html">FUJIWARA no Maro</a>, the forth son of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Udaijin (Minister of the Right).html">Udaijin</a> (Minister of the Right) <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Fuhito.html">FUJIWARA no Fuhito</a>. Kyoke is one of Fujiwara four families. </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>The name of Kyoke originated from the fact that Maro was appointed as Sakyo no daibu (Master of the Eastern Capital Offices). Kyoke was the least prosperous among the Fujiwara four families. The reason is that Maro was the youngest of Fujiwara four brothers and had less number of children (and many of them suffered of premature death), as well as that <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Hamanari.html">FUJIWARA no Hamanari</a>, the only person in Kyoke to be appointed to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Sangi.html">sangi</a> (councilor), was exiled because of his implication in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/HIKAMI no Kawatsugu.html">HIKAMI no Kawatsugu</a>'s War, which put an end to the political life of the Kyoke family. </p>
<p>During the Heian period, Kyoke produced many talents in culture and art: FUJIWARA no Sadatoshi (biwa, Japanese lute), <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Fuyuo.html">FUJIWARA no Fuyuo</a> (Confucianism), <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/FUJIWARA no Okikaze.html">FUJIWARA no Okikaze</a> (waka, Japanese poetry), and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Tadafusa.html">FUJIWARA no Tadafusa</a> (waka and bugaku, or Japanese court dance and music) among others. Particularly, Fuyuo was promoted to be <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Dainagon (chief councilor of state).html">Dainagon</a> (chief councilor of state), partly due to his longevity. Since Imperial Prince Nakano, son of FUJIWARA no Kawako who was a consort of Emperor Kanmu, became a maternal grandfather of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Uda.html">Emperor Uda</a>, family lineage of Fujiwara Kyoke is still inherited to present. </p>
<p>In the later period, Naoe clan of the Echigo Province calls themselves as the descendants of Kyoke. <h3>Family</h3>
