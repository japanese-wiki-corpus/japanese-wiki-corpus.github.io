<h1>Suebe (陶部)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Suebe (or Suetsukuribe) was a group of people who were engaged in manufacturing <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Sueki (unglazed ware).html">Sueki</a> (unglazed ware) before Taika period. </p>
<p><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Sueki (unglazed ware).html">Sueki</a> and its producing technique are said to have been introduced from the Southern area of the Korean Peninsula in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kofun period (tumulus period).html">Kofun period</a>, and Suebe is considered to have been formed to manufacture <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Sueki (unglazed ware).html">Sueki</a> on a large scale in Suemura, Chinu Province and other places (present-day near Naka Ward and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Minami Ward (Kyoto City).html">Minami Ward</a>, Sakai City, Osaka Prefecture) in the beginning of the 5th century. In the article of 27 B.C. in "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan).html">Nihonshoki</a>" (Chronicles of Japan), it says that in Kagami Village, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Omi Province.html">Omi Province</a>, there was a craftsman of Suebe who served the prince of Silla, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Amenohiboko.html">Amenohiboko</a>, who came to Japan. In the article of 463, it says that craftsmen including SUETSUKURI-no-Koki were presented as tributes from Baekje. This could not be soon regarded as a fact, but may be considered as a reflection of the fact that many of the Suebe craftsmen came from Silla and Baekje. </p>
<p>However, it is unknown which official supervised Suebe and there is no record that shows Suebe became Tomobe (administrative officials), <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shinabe (Technicians in Offices).html">Shinabe</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Zakko (Special Technicians).html">Zakko</a> (groups of technicians), who belonged to a specific government official, under the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ritsuryo.html">Ritsuryo</a> system (especially, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yoro Ritsuryo Code.html">Yoro Ritsuryo Code</a>). So, Suebe was dissolved and its members were absorbed in a private group of craftsmen in the eighth century at the latest, and the Imperial Court was considered to have been given earth wares including <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Sueki (unglazed ware).html">Sueki</a> from private sectors through tributes or exchanges with the rice tax. </p>
