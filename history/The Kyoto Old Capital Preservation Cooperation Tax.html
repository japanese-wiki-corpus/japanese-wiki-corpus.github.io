<h1>The Kyoto Old Capital Preservation Cooperation Tax (古都保存協力税)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The Kyoto Old Capital Preservation Cooperation Tax was one of the local taxes, which was once levied in accordance with a tax ordinance enacted by Kyoto city. It is hereinafter referred to as the Old Capital Tax. </p>
<p><h3>Local Taxation Systems</h3>
</p>
<p>The introduction of taxation yields money which goes into local government coffers from the pockets of the taxpayers. The money spent from government funds covers administrative costs and returned to citizens who receive government services. </p>
<p>A local taxation system which creates this cycle cannot be established without taking a certain form. This certain form refers to the legal definition of the time, liability, method and amount of taxation. This form is essential for taxpayers to understand the taxation and to alleviate their discontent about the tax. On the other hand, depending on purpose of taxation, a form in which tax is collected uniformly from taxpayers by an administrative body is sometimes inappropriate to the real situation. For this reason, tax laws involve temporary legislation and exception provisions. </p>
<p>For example, schools and religious institutions are not subject to Fixed Property Tax which is imposed on the acquisition of real estate. Kyoto City, which established the Old Capital Tax, is not only an university city but also has Buddhist temples and Shinto shrines. These institutions are exempt from paying Fixed Property Tax. </p>
<p>In addition, temporary legislation is aimed at setting a certain grace period during which a tax system is overhauled to decide whether it needs to be abolished or maintained. It requires flexible application no matter how wide its range of application may be. Nevertheless, once a taxation system is established, the administrative organization is invested with great powers to enforce it. Therefore, thorough examination of its legislation is required until it becomes effective. <h3>Old Capital Tax</h3>
</p>
<p>Tax is collected by prefectures and municipalities in exchange for the provision of public services. The 'Local Tax Act' stipulates tax items on which a local governments can impose taxes. The act also allows each local government to establish its own tax items. The Old Capital Tax is based on an ordinance issued by Kyoto city. </p>
<p>The Old Capital Tax was established by Masahiko IMAGAWA, who was the mayor of Kyoto city at the time. According to his explanation to the City Assembly, the tax was imposed not on the citizens but on the entrance fee paid to the temples and the shrines in Kyoto city, with the intention of eliciting cooperation with the city from the visitors in protecting its cultural properties. For ten years after the enforcement of the act, visitors to the temples and the shrines subject to the tax had to pay an additional fee of 50 yen (for adults) or 30 yen (for children) as the tax imposed on the entrance fee. This was in the form of a special collection in which the temples and the shrines subject to the tax acted as special tax collectors and paid the tax income to the city. </p>
<p>There was also the opinion that imposing taxes on visitors from outside the city may be in opposition to the benefit principle of taxation. From the point of view that visiting temples and shrines is a religious activity, there was another opinion that the taxation of the entrance fee may be an act repugnant to the Constitution, which ensures freedom of religion. It is also said that an earlier example of introducing a similar taxation by Kyoto city motivated mayor IMAGAWA to establish the Old Capital Tax. </p>
<p>In 1956, the Tax on Cultural Tourism (the full title of which is the Tax on Cultural Tourist Facilities, and which is commonly known as the Bunkan tax) was enforced in Kyoto city. Kyoto Kaikan Hall located at Okazaki was built owing to the benefit of this Bunkan tax. As it had been an act valid only for a limited time of 7.5 years, the city enacted a similar ordinance in 1964 as temporary legislation with a five-year term limit. At this time, due to the opposition against this ordinance, Yoshizo TAKAYAMA, the mayor at the time, exchanged memorandums with the opposing temples and shrines in which he stated that the same kind of taxation would be neither enforced nor extended thereafter. <h3>Chronology of the Old Capital Tax</h3>
