<h1>Bunan no Koji Sodo (Bunan-era Koji Dispute) (文安の麹騒動)</h1>
<p>Bunan no Koji Sodo was an incident in which <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kitano (Kyoto City).html">Kitano</a> koji za (a guild in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kitano (Kyoto City).html">Kitano</a> for producers of koji malt, a kind of mold grown on produce such as boiled rice), who controlled production of koji malt (which is part of the sake brewing process) in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, was attacked by the Muromachi <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>) causing its decline during the Muromachi Period. As a result, this lead to the downfall of the koji malt industry which was subsequently incorporated into the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Sakaya.html">sakaya</a> (liquor store) industry. </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>Although the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Sakaya.html">sakaya</a> industry had existed in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> since the Kamakura Period, production of koji malt did not fall under the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Sakaya.html">sakaya</a> industry at the time, with the production and sale of kojiya malt being independent. Obtaining the position of jinin (associates of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> shrines) at Kitano-sha Shrine (present <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kitano (Kyoto City).html">Kitano</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Tenman-gu Shrine.html">Tenman-gu Shrine</a>), the kojiya formed a guild called 'koji-za' and had exclusive rights to produce and sell koji malt in the western part of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> backed by the authority of Kitano-sha Shrine (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Honjo (proprietor or guarantor of manor).html">honjo</a> (proprietor or guarantor of manor)). </p>
<p>The <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kitano (Kyoto City).html">Kitano</a> koji za reacted strongly to the penetration of the koji malt production industry by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Sakaya.html">Sakaya</a> with financial power. However, the Muromachi <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>, in its prime under <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshimitsu ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshimitsu ASHIKAGA</a>, regulated <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Enryaku-ji Temple.html">Enryaku-ji Temple</a> and other powerful temples and shrines in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> which exercised their private power within the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> area in 1386 (Concentrating police authority in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>). Furthermore, with 'Five rules regarding doso and sake shops scattered around Rakuchu' enacted in 1393, the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> taxed doso (pawnbrokers and moneylenders) and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Sakaya.html">sakaya</a> in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> without exception regardless of guild membership, and, as a result, the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Honjo (proprietor or guarantor of manor).html">honjo</a>'s sovereignty over the guild was allowed only under regulation by the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>. Although <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Enryaku-ji Temple.html">Enryaku-ji Temple</a>, the largest <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Honjo (proprietor or guarantor of manor).html">honjo</a> power at the time, strongly opposed to these rules, they were helpless before the momentum of Yoshimitsu. </p>
<p>Taking advantage of this situation, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kitano (Kyoto City).html">Kitano</a> koji za approached the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> in exchange for tax paid to the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>. In 1419, the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> gave all rights to produce and sell koji malt in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kitano (Kyoto City).html">Kitano</a> koji za, and it was determined that all <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Sakaya.html">sakaya</a> in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> should purchase koji malt from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kitano (Kyoto City).html">Kitano</a> koji za. When the sakayas opposed this, the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> mobilized an army to destroy every koji factory called 'koji muro' attached to the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Sakaya.html">sakaya</a>. </p>
<p>However, some of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Sakaya.html">sakaya</a> belonged to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Enryaku-ji Temple.html">Enryaku-ji Temple</a> as their <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Honjo (proprietor or guarantor of manor).html">honjo</a>, and they complained about the conduct of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> and the koji za to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Enryaku-ji Temple.html">Enryaku-ji Temple</a>. Kitano-sha Shrine was under the control of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Enryaku-ji Temple.html">Enryaku-ji Temple</a> at the time, and, worried that the decline of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Sakaya.html">sakaya</a> under its control would result in decreased tax income, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Enryaku-ji Temple.html">Enryaku-ji Temple</a> asked Kitano-sha Shrine to stop the monopoly. However, Kitano-sha Shrine rejected the request because the issue had to due with their own tax income. </p>
<p>The conflict between the koji za and the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Sakaya.html">sakaya</a> and between Kitano-sha Shrine and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Enryaku-ji Temple.html">Enryaku-ji Temple</a> escalated resulting in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Enryaku-ji Temple.html">Enryaku-ji Temple</a> barricading themselves in Saito-Shakado, and petitioning <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> in 1444. The <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>, whose political influence had weakened after the Kakitsu Incident three years before, gave in to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Enryaku-ji Temple.html">Enryaku-ji Temple</a>, and allowed the abolition of the monopoly on <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kitano (Kyoto City).html">Kitano</a> koji za. A group of jinin belonging to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kitano (Kyoto City).html">Kitano</a> koji za barricaded themselves in Kitano-sha Shrine in protest against the decision. In response, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Mochikuni HATAKEYAMA.html">Mochikuni HATAKEYAMA</a>, the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kanrei.html">kanrei</a> (shogunal deputy), dispatched an army to Kitano-sha Shrine on April 13 to suppress the protest. This lead to an armed conflict leaving some dead, and the area around Kitano-sha Shrine burnt, but the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> successfully conquered the surrounding area. As a result, the kojiya gave in to the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Sakaya.html">sakaya</a>, and the koji za in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> fell into decline. In a political sense, the derogation of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>'s power to control <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> became apparent, and revived the influence held by powerful temples. After that, though the monopoly of the koji malt by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kitano (Kyoto City).html">Kitano</a> koji za was permitted again in 1545 due to the catch up by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kitano (Kyoto City).html">Kitano</a> koji za, it was too late, as the Muromachi <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> had fallen from power, and the production of koji malt had become integrated into the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Sakaya.html">sakaya</a> industry. </p>
<p>This incident also contributed to the rise of sobo shu (sake produced by monks) such as "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Bodaisen.html">Bodaisen</a>," "Yamadaru," and "Yamato Tafunomine zake" in Nara, "Hogen zake" in Echizen, "Hyakusaidera shu" in Omi, and "Kanshinji shu" in Kawachi. </p>
