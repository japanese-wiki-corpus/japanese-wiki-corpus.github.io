<h1>Kakitsu Treaty (嘉吉条約)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kakitsu Treaty was a trade agreement concluded between Korean Dynasties and Sadamori SO of Tsushima Province in 1443, the Muromachi period in Japan. This treaty was designed to restrict the amount of trading ships and trading amounts. It was also called Kigai yakujo, named after the Oriental zodiac. </p>
<p>With this trade agreement, it was confirmed that 50 saikensen (ship to dispatch an envoy to Korea) be permitted from Tsushima per year, and 200 koku of rice per year be given out from the Korean Dynasties in return. This treaty, coupled with the Bunin (a pass issued by the So clan to enter the Korean Dynasties) system, effectively enabled the head family of the So clan to control trading among the powers within Tsushima island, strengthening territorial rule by the So clan. </p>
<p>Although the relationship was once severed following the Sanpo disturbance that erupted in 1510, Jinshin Yakujo (immigration rule where the Korean Dynasties warned the So clan) was concluded in 1512 and trading was resumed. </p>
