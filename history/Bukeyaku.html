<h1>Bukeyaku (武家役)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Bukeyaku was a general term for taxation imposed by the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> and Muromachi <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>). </p>
<p>There are two ways of broad classification for the bukeyaku. One is categorized based upon who had the initiative on imposing the taxation. According to this <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Point (Sentoki).html">point</a> of view, there were public services ordered by the Imperial court to the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> which were shifted onto <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Gokenin.html">Gokenin</a> (an immediate vassal of the shogunate during the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> and Muromachi through the Edo periods), <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a> and Jito (military governor and estate steward), and taxes and labor imposed independently by the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> in order to operate and maintain itself. The other categorization is based upon the objects of the taxation. There were taxes and labor borne by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Gokenin.html">Gokenin</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a>, and Jito as a part of their obligations to the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> because they had a relationship of favor and service with the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>. There were other taxes and labor imposed on ordinary people, temples, shrines, and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> (manor in medieval Japan) in the same relationship with the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> in the form of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Tansen.html">tansen</a> (a kind of provisional tax in medieval Japan) and munabetsu-sen, both of which had the aspect of Ikkoku heikinyaku (taxes and labor uniformly imposed on <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> (manor) and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kokugaryo.html">kokugaryo</a> (provincial land) in a province). </p>
<p>The bukeyaku imposed by the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> was called Kanto-kuji (public duties). It was imposed on <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Gokenin.html">Gokenin</a> based upon the size of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Koden.html">koden</a> (field administered directly by a ruler) in their shoryo (territories) which was registered on a cadaster called Ota-bumi. Broadly dividing this Kanto-kuji, there were taxes for operating organizations, managing events and building facilities of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> institutions, such as seii taishogun (literally, "great general who subdues the barbarians") and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Mandokoro.html">Mandokoro</a> (Administrative Board), and were also services ordered by the Imperial court, such as building of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Dairi (the Imperial palace).html">dairi</a> (Imperial Palace), temples and shrines, or construction of embankment along the Kamo-gawa River (the Yodo-gawa River system), etc. There were other forms of bukeyaku, such as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Obanyaku.html">Obanyaku</a> (a job to guard <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>) or <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Gunyaku.html">Gunyaku</a>, which services required direct exercising of military powers. After the Mongol invasion attempts against Japan, these burdens became intolerable, and the shifting of the burdens onto peasants aroused the bitterest opposition among them. This became one of the factors that destabilized the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> shogunate system. </p>
<p>The bukeyaku by the Muromachi <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> was mainly imposed on <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shugo daimyo.html">Shugo daimyo</a> (Japanese territorial lord as provincial constable) and the citizens of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. The bukeyaku imposed on <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shugo daimyo.html">Shugo daimyo</a> was called Shugo-desen, which was usually imposed on each territory in the form of Ikkoku heikinyaku, such as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Tansen.html">tansen</a> and munabetsu-sen. The <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shugo daimyo.html">Shugo daimyo</a> made use of these taxes to spread their dominion over their territories. On the other hand, the Muromachi <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> successfully took over the right to levy taxes on citizens of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, a right formerly enjoyed by the Imperial court. The <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> earned a large income by imposing Jiguchi sen (taxes imposed based on size of frontage), <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Sakaya.html">Sakaya</a> yaku (taxes imposed on sake brewery by Muromachi <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>), Doso yaku (taxes imposed on an underground warehouse), Bajo yaku and so on. The <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> also made extra income by the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Tally.html">tally</a> trade (between Japan and the Ming Dynasty) and further augmented the income by counting the money donated by Zen temples (temples belonging to the Zen sect) such as gosan (Zen temples highly ranked by the government) in exchange for its protection over such temples, and buichi-sen (a commission for issuance of a debt cancellation order). These incomes played an important role for the Muromachi <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>, which was unable to own land equivalent to Kantogobunkoku (provincial territories belonging to the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>). </p>
