<h1>The Battle of Uji-gawa River (宇治川の戦い)</h1>
<p>The Battle of Uji-gawa River was a battle that took place in January 1184, at the end of Heian period, between <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Yoshinaka.html">MINAMOTO no Yoshinaka</a>, and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Noriyori.html">MINAMOTO no Noriyori</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Yoshitsune.html">MINAMOTO no Yoshitsune</a> who were dispatched by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Yoritomo.html">MINAMOTO no Yoritomo</a> in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a>. It's one of the battles in the Jisho Juei Rebellion. </p>

</p>
<p>In July 1183, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Yoshinaka.html">MINAMOTO no Yoshinaka</a>, who raised an army in Shinano Province to overturn the Taira family, led several tens of thousands of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> into <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. Yoshinaka's troops brought violence and riots to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, and with time, he was in conflict with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Goshirakawa.html">Emperor Goshirakawa</a> over succession to the imperial throne. In September, Yoshinaka's troops were severely defeated by the troops of the Taira family in the Battle of Mizushima in Bizen Province, and Cloistered <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Goshirakawa.html">Emperor Goshirakawa</a> forsook him. In October, Cloistered <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Goshirakawa.html">Emperor Goshirakawa</a> sent an imperial letter to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Yoritomo.html">MINAMOTO no Yoritomo</a> in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> authorizing control over <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Tokaido.html">Tokaido</a> and Tosando, and approaches Yoritomo (imperial letter of October, Juei 2). 
<br/>In November, Yoshinaka makes another attack on the Hoju-ji Temple Palace, the residence of the retired Emperor, and confines the Cloistered <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Goshirakawa.html">Emperor Goshirakawa</a> to gain power (the Battle of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Hoju-ji Temple (Kyoto City).html">Hoju-ji Temple</a>)<br/>
Yoshinaka, who became increasingly isolated, attempted to make peace with the Taira family, but was rejected. In December, Yoshinaka forced the Cloistered <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Goshirakawa.html">Emperor Goshirakawa</a> to issue a command from a retired Emperor to track down and kill Yoritomo. In January 1184, Yoshinaka was appointed <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Seii Taishogun.html">Seii Taishogun</a> (literally, "great general who subdues the barbarians") (or Seito Taishogun (literally, "great general who subdues the eastern barbarians")). On January 20, Yoritomo ordered Noriyori and Yoshitsune, whom he had moved to Omi, to track down and kill Yoshinaka. </p>
<p>Yoshinaka's troops, that numbered several tens of thousands of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> warriors when they went into <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, had decreased dramatically down to about one thousand, because of the stream of dropouts due to the defeat at the Battle of Mizushima and the deteriorated situation. Yoshinaka gave <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kanehira IMAI.html">Kanehira IMAI</a>, one of the big four of Yoshinaka, about 500 <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> to guard Seta (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Shiga Prefecture.html">Shiga Prefecture</a>), about 300 <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yukichika NENOI.html">Yukichika NENOI</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Chikatada TATE.html">Chikatada TATE</a> to guard <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Uji City.html">Uji City</a>, and Yoshinaka himself guarded the imperial palace with about 100 <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a>. On January 20, Noriyori attacked Seta with 30,000 <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> head-on and Yoshitsune attacked Uji from the rear with another 25,000. </p>
<p>Yoshitsune's troops entered the Uji-gawa River under a shower of arrows. This is where the 'Fight for the vanguard in Uji-gawa River' between <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Takatsuna SASAKI.html">Takatsuna SASAKI</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kagesue KAJIWARA.html">Kagesue KAJIWARA</a> occurred. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yukichika NENOI.html">Yukichika NENOI</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Chikatada TATE.html">Chikatada TATE</a> desperately fought a defensive battle, but Yoshitsune's troops managed to cross the Uji-gawa River. Yoshitsune's troops surged into <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. Yoshinaka fought a fierce battle with Yoshitsune's troops. Yoshinaka fought bravely, but was finally defeated, and headed to the imperial palace to escape to Kyushu with the Cloistered <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Goshirakawa.html">Emperor Goshirakawa</a>. Yoshitsune personally led several <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> warriors to chase and drive away Yoshinaka from the front gate of the imperial palace, and succeeded in securing the safety of the Cloistered <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Goshirakawa.html">Emperor Goshirakawa</a>. After giving up on taking the Cloistered <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Goshirakawa.html">Emperor Goshirakawa</a>, Yoshinaka headed to Seta to join <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kanehira IMAI.html">Kanehira IMAI</a>. </p>
<p><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kanehira IMAI.html">Kanehira IMAI</a>, who had been fighting Noriyori's troops at Seta, retreated, having heard about the defeat at Uji, and successfully joined Yoshinaka in Awazu. Yoshinaka attempted to escape to Hokuriku-do (northern prefectures), but was attacked by Noriyori's enormous army. Yoshinaka's troops fought bravely, but were killed one after another, and when down to the last few, Yoshinaka was killed by an arrow striking deep into his face. Following Yoshinaka, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kanehira IMAI.html">Kanehira IMAI</a> took his own life. </p>
