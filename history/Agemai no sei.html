<h1>Agemai no sei (上米の制)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Agemai no sei was a rule issued by the Edo Bakufu at the time of Kyoho-no-kaikaku (Kyoho reform). It was enacted in 1722. </p>
<p>A Daimyo (Japanese feudal lord) had to make obligatory delivery of 100 Koku of rice per 10,000 Koku crop yields to the Bakufu. In exchange for the above, the Daimyo was allowed to reduce the duration of his stay in Edo to a half year (usually one year) in Sankinkotai (a system under which feudal lords in the Edo period were required to spend every other year in residence in Edo). </p>
<p>While the rule contributed to an increase in the Bakufu's revenue, it faced many problems and was abolished in 1730. </p>
