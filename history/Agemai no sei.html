<h1>Agemai no sei (上米の制)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Agemai no sei was a rule issued by the Edo <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">Bakufu</a> at the time of Kyoho-no-kaikaku (Kyoho reform). It was enacted in 1722. </p>
<p>A <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">Daimyo</a> (Japanese feudal lord) had to make obligatory delivery of 100 Koku of rice per 10,000 Koku crop yields to the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">Bakufu</a>. In exchange for the above, the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">Daimyo</a> was allowed to reduce the duration of his stay in Edo to a half year (usually one year) in Sankinkotai (a system under which feudal lords in the Edo period were required to spend every other year in residence in Edo). </p>
<p>While the rule contributed to an increase in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">Bakufu</a>'s revenue, it faced many problems and was abolished in 1730. </p>
