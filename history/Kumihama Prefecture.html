<h1>Kumihama Prefecture (久美浜県)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kumihama Prefecture was a prefecture established in 1868. It was abolished and consolidated into <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Toyooka Prefecture.html">Toyooka Prefecture</a> in 1871. </p>
<p>It had control over the Kumihama and Ikuno magistrate's office-dominated land in the five provinces of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Tango (the Boys Festival).html">Tango</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Tanba (train).html">Tanba</a>, Tajima, Harima and Mimasaka, and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Hatamoto (direct retainers of shogun).html">Hatamoto</a> domain in Tajima and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Tanba (train).html">Tanba</a>, which amounted to 926 villages and 230,000 koku. </p>
<p>The prefectural government was located in the former Kumihama magistrate's office (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyotango City.html">Kyotango City</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto Prefecture.html">Kyoto Prefecture</a>). Since the former magistrate's office was too small, a government building was newly made in 1870. </p>
<p>As separatist movements was mounted in places dominated by the Ikuno magistrate's office, three provinces of Tajima (except for a part of northern Tajima), Harima and Mimasaka were separated from Kumihama Prefecture and formed <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ikuno Prefecture.html">Ikuno Prefecture</a> in 1869. A part of southern Tajima was transferred to the Sasayama Domain. </p>
<p>In 1871, Kumihama Prefecture was abolished and consolidated into <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Toyooka Prefecture.html">Toyooka Prefecture</a>. </p>
