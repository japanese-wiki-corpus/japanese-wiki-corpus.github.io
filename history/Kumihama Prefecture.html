<h1>Kumihama Prefecture (久美浜県)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kumihama Prefecture was a prefecture established in 1868. It was abolished and consolidated into Toyooka Prefecture in 1871. </p>
<p>It had control over the Kumihama and Ikuno magistrate's office-dominated land in the five provinces of Tango, Tanba, Tajima, Harima and Mimasaka, and Hatamoto domain in Tajima and Tanba, which amounted to 926 villages and 230,000 koku. </p>
<p>The prefectural government was located in the former Kumihama magistrate's office (Kyotango City, Kyoto Prefecture). Since the former magistrate's office was too small, a government building was newly made in 1870. </p>
<p>As separatist movements was mounted in places dominated by the Ikuno magistrate's office, three provinces of Tajima (except for a part of northern Tajima), Harima and Mimasaka were separated from Kumihama Prefecture and formed Ikuno Prefecture in 1869. A part of southern Tajima was transferred to the Sasayama Domain. </p>
<p>In 1871, Kumihama Prefecture was abolished and consolidated into Toyooka Prefecture. </p>
