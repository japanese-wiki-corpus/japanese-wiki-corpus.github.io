<h1>Ikezuki (the fine horse given by MINAMOTO no Yoritomo) (生食)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Ikezuki (生食) was the name of fine horses which did remarkable work in the end of Heian period. Other Kanji characters for Ikezuki are 池月 and 生唼. </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>From olden times, military horses were produced in the tablelands around Funabashi City, Kamagaya City, Matsudo City, Kashiwa City and Shirai City which were suitable for grazing horses. </p>
<p>At the end of Heian period, a kind of horse was produced in the present Kashiwa City which was so fine that it was believed to be a messenger of Hachiman (God of War), and it was called 'Ikezuki' and worshipped. </p>
<p>Afterword, Ikezuki was presented to MINAMOTO no Yoritomo. Ikezuki was given to Takatsuna SASAKI, who was honored to be in the vanguard in the Battle of Uji-gawa River. There are Shinto shrines originating in Ikezuki in the regions of Shirai City, Kashiwa City and so on at the present time. </p>
<p>Ikezuki (生食) derives from fierceness of eating living creatures and Ikezuki (池月) from the moon reflected on a pond. In view of the above, the difference of letters comes from the difference of positions. </p>
