<h1>History of Japanese Navy (日本の海軍史)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The history of Japanese navy goes back to the early medieval period in which Japan interacted with countries on the Asian Continent. 
<br/>Its activities reached the peak in the trade with European countries in 16th and 17th centuries<br/>
Japan's naval technologies, however, came to lag behind those of European countries because of the isolation policy taken during the Edo period. Japan's being far behind the naval technologies of the West was glaringly clear to everyone to see when Kurofune (the Black ships of Commodore Matthew Perry) came to Japan and this fact led Japan to the Meiji Restoration. As a result of having hurried the modernization and industrialization of Japan, the Imperial Japanese Navy became the third largest navy in the world in 1920. </p>
<p>The history of the large-scale military campaigns of the Imperial Navy began with the 1895 Sino-Japanese War and the 1905 Russo-Japanese War ended with the Imperial Navy's near perfect victory; however, in the Great East Asian War (the Pacific War) the fighting power of the fleets of the Imperial Navy was almost completely annihilated by the United States Navy and the Imperial Navy was officially dissolved at the end of the war. Japan's current navy falls under the umbrella of the Japan Self-Defense Forces as the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force. In terms of budget, it is one of the top navies in the world; however, it is denied of many offensive roles. </p>
