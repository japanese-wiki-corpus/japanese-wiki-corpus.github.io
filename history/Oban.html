<h1>Oban (椀飯)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Oban was a type of menu for entertaining guests. Also, it later indicated the ceremony and event of entertaining guests with food. </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>During the Heian period, scheduled and temporary court events such as Sechie and Sechiku (seasonal festivals) had Himeii (cooked rice) piled high in a bowl as the centerpiece with side dishes such as dishes for drinking and snacks. Oban was classified into 'Tenjo no oban' and 'Shosho no oba' and this was gathered by the several designated tenjobito (high-ranking courtier allowed into the Imperial Palace) when necessary, but these were <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Bento (lunch box).html">bento</a> (packed meals)/light snacks that were considered separate from the official ceremony. Tenjo no oban' eaten by the tenjobito had a rice bowl, soup bowl, plate, small dish and chopsticks on a Oshiki (tray with folded edges) with Sai (side dishes) in Ke(dishes) inside a Oribitsu, Kashi (sweets) in a Hokai (wooden lidded container) and Heishi (sake serving cup) and hai (drinking cup) were placed on a small Oshiki. Shosho no oban' were served to officials at the Daibandokoro, Takiguchi, Mushadokoro and was simpler than the above, with a rice bowl and chopsticks on a tray, Sai in Ke inside a Oribitsu bamboo and Kashi in a Hokai were the same as 'Tenjo no oban,' but other contents differed according to the situation. </p>
<p>After the cloistered government period, oban started to hold a more ceremonial aspect during the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period. For example, local officials served oban as a welcome banquet for the newly appointed <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kokushi.html">Kokushi</a> and this custom of oban spread from local officials to the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bushi.html">bushi</a> (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a>) class. After the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>) was established by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Yoritomo.html">MINAMOTO no Yoritomo</a>, oban was served at important ceremonies such as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Genpuku (celebrate ones coming of age).html">Genpuku</a> (coming of age) and Ito (moving), and the '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Saishu (Chief Priest).html">Saishu</a> no oban' that was served in the beginning of the year became one of the most important ceremonies of the buke (military) government. At the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>, for a few days from the first day of the year, the Hojo clan and other prominent <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Gokenin.html">gokenin</a> (an immediate vassal of the shogunate) presented the Seii taishogun (literally, "great general who subdues the barbarians") with oban together with swords, good horses, and bows and arrows. At the Muromachi <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>, there was a ceremony where prominent <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shugo daimyo.html">Shugo daimyo</a> (Japanese territorial lord as provincial constable) family heads (toryo) served oban to the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> and ate together, and the date to serve oban at the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>'s place was chosen for each <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">Daimyo</a> family. In other words, Oban was to be served on New Year's day by the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kanrei.html">kanrei</a> (shogunal deputy) of that time, Toki clan on the second, Sasaki clan on the third, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/family/Akamatsu clan.html">Akamatsu clan</a> on the seventh, and Yamanaka clan on the fifteenth (However, when the Sasaki clan split into the Kyogoku and Rokkaku clans, the two clans took turns serving oban). The menu at that time was rice in a bowl with the three dishes, abalone, jellyfish, and pickled plum, with vinegar and salt on an Oshiki (tray). In addition, an event called 'Hosho', where live fish was prepared by a chef in front of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> was also conducted. </p>
<p>After the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Onin War.html">Onin War</a>, oban was not conducted at the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> any more, but within the ordinary buke society, it transformed from a ceremony where vassals entertained their lord into a ceremony where the lord entertained his vassals in the beginning of the year and Sechi (seasonal) times. In the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Edo bakufu.html">Edo bakufu</a>, the Gosanke (the three privileged branches of the Tokugawa family) in Edo would entertain the roju (member of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>'s council of elders) and other prominent council members and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Hatamoto (direct retainers of shogun).html">hatamoto</a> (direct retainers of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>), and in a similar way, the Machibugyo (town magistrate) would entertain <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Yoriki (a governmental post in the Edo bakufu).html">yoriki</a> (police sergeant) and others at the official residence and these were considered oban. 
<br/>Such customs spread to the public and the act of inviting relatives and friends at the beginning of the year was called 'Oban burumai,' 'Sechi burumai,' and this is said to be the origin of 'Oban burumai (being generous).'<br/>
