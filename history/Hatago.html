<h1>Hatago (旅籠)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Hatago (inn) is a house where travelers lodge and meals are offered to the travelers in the Edo period. Hatago is short for hatago-ya. </p>
<p>The term hatago originally represented a basket to put a feed for horses during the trip. Later, the term hatago had a meaning of a container to put food and the like for travelers, then the meaning changed to meals served in the inn and the inn where the meals were served was called hatago-ya, in short, hatago. </p>
<p>Many hatago were located in each shukuba (post station) on kaido (road) in the Edo period and crowded with guests such as samurai and the common people. Hatago were gradually separated into meshimori hatago where meshimori onna (literally "woman serving meal", women who were maids servants hired by the inns, although later, often engaged in prostitution) looking after guests were hired and hira hatago where meshimori onna were not hired. However, as kyu-kaido (old road) fell into disuse and network of railroads developed in the Meiji period, transportation on foot or by cow or horse decreased and as a result hatago have been driven out of business or relocated in front of the station one after another. There are only a few ryokan (Japanese-style hotel) that are still kept in the same place in old shukuba-machi (post station) in a way exactly the same as before. It was said that guests were asked to share a room with other guests at busy times and woman travelers had difficulty with it. </p>
<p>Accommodation fee in hatago was generally around 200 to 300 mon (corresponding to 3,000 to 5,000 yen in present currency value) per night. </p>

<p><h3>Association of hatago</h3>
</p>
<p>In the middle of the Edo period, there was an increasing demand from guests who disliked aggressive runners or meshimori onna and peddlers who traveled alone for the inn where guests could stay in peace and as a result association of hatago was established in various places. </p>
<p>For example, Naniwa-gumi (later Naniwa-ko) designated serious and high-grade hatago along main kaido (road) and had member hatago place a sign as a mark and handed a given kansatsu (license plate) over to each traveler who joined the association so that travelers could show it when staying in the inn. The association also issued "Naniwa Dochu-ki" and "Naniwa-ko Joyado-cho" which listed names of hatago joined in Naniwa-ko and rest houses by shukueki (post town) and included information serving as a guide that was also useful as dochu-ki. </p>
