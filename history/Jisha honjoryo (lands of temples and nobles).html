<p>Jisha Honjoryo was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> (private estate) and shoryo (individual holding, domain) specifically meaning kugeryo (estate of the nobility) and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Jisharyo (Lands of local temples and shrines).html">jisharyo</a> (estate of local temples and shrines) separately from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bukeryo (Lands of military families).html">bukeryo</a> (estate of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> family.)<br/>
</p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>Before the twelfth century when <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bushi.html">bushi</a> (warriors) came into power, there was no distinction among the estates, and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> and shoryo belonged to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Honjo (proprietor or guarantor of manor).html">honjo</a> (owner of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a>), who has shomuken (administrative power and jurisdiction in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a>), were called '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Honjo (proprietor or guarantor of manor).html">honjo</a> ryo' (patronage properties) of the corresponding ryoshu (estate proprietors; the court nobles, temples and shrines). 
<br/>At the end of the twelfth century, however, three of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bukeryo (Lands of military families).html">bukeryo</a> including Kanto goryo (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>'s personal holdings) of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> (general of the eastern pacification command in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a>), corresponding to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> and shoryo, the existing kugeryo and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Jisharyo (Lands of local temples and shrines).html">jisharyo</a>, and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kokugaryo.html">kokugaryo</a> (provincial land) koryo (public land) needed to be distinguished from one another, and accordingly, they were called 'honjoryo.'<br/>
The <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> succeeded in calling the residents in the honjoryo, in which the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> established a ruling throughout the land, to arms through the external crisis accompanying <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Genko (Mongol invasion).html">Genko</a> (Mongol Invasion), but still cannot exercise kendanken (provincial policing authority) and so forth on the honjoryo -- On the contrary, the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> prayed for divine protection and expected god and Buddha to support the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> to overcome the external crisis, and took a policy to protect not the right of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Gokenin.html">gokenin</a> (the top of the warrior-class hierarchy) but the right of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Jisharyo (Lands of local temples and shrines).html">jisharyo</a> by issuing the jishakogyoho (Shrine restoration policy). The term 'honjoryo' originally included the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Jisharyo (Lands of local temples and shrines).html">jisharyo</a>, but from the end of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period to the Nanbokucho period (Japanese North and South Dynasties period), '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Jisharyo (Lands of local temples and shrines).html">jisharyo</a>' was written separately from 'honjoryo' to distinguish between the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Jisharyo (Lands of local temples and shrines).html">jisharyo</a> and the honjoryo. </p>
<p>The Muromachi <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> called the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Jisharyo (Lands of local temples and shrines).html">jisharyo</a> and the kugeryo collectively as '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Jisha (Buddhist Temples and Shinto Shrines).html">jisha</a> honjoryo', and called especially the land, throughout of which was ruled by the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> and neither jito (steward) nor <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Azukari (official post).html">azukari</a> dokoro (estate custodian) was placed, as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Honjo (proprietor or guarantor of manor).html">honjo</a> ichien shihaichi (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Honjo (proprietor or guarantor of manor).html">honjo</a> throughout ruled land) (It was considered that the term '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Jisha (Buddhist Temples and Shinto Shrines).html">jisha</a> honjoryo' first appeared in the laws and regulations of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> in 1351. The <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kokugaryo.html">kokugaryo</a> was included in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Jisha (Buddhist Temples and Shinto Shrines).html">jisha</a> honjoryo in some cases.)<br/>
Along with kinri goryo (private estate of Imperial Palace) and denka watariryo (a collection of estates passed on by inheritance to the Fujiwara house chieftain) (sekkanke shoryo; estate of the Fujiwara <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Regent.html">regent</a>'s line), <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Jisha (Buddhist Temples and Shinto Shrines).html">jisha</a> honjoryo was under the protection of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>, but in the Nanbokucho civil war, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Hyoro (army provisions).html">hyoro</a> ryosho (land specified for collecting provisions) was settled there for securing provisions or it was embezzled by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> families as the object of hanzeirei (half-tax decrees). To cope with this situation, the Muromachi <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> took the attitude of rejecting all the cases of embezzlement by forcing shitaji chubun (physical division of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a>) on the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Jisha (Buddhist Temples and Shinto Shrines).html">jisha</a> honjoryo by promulgating oan no hanzeirei (half-tax decrees in the oan era) (but, even the half-tax measure was rejected for kinri goryo, denka watariryo, and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Honjo (proprietor or guarantor of manor).html">honjo</a> ichien shihaichi); however, during the Sengoku period (warring states period), the decree became in name only and most part of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Jisha (Buddhist Temples and Shinto Shrines).html">jisha</a> honjoryo except for the land under the direct rule was deprived by sengoku <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> (local chieftain of warring province) and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kokujin.html">kokujin</a> (leading local warrior). </p>
