<h1>Shinden (神田)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>A Shinden (also referred as Kanda) is a rice field whose produce is used to pay for the costs of a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> shrine's Saishi (religious services). It is also called Mitoshiro, Omita (御神田), Onta, or Omita (大御田). </p>
<p><h3>History</h3>
</p>
<p>The origins of Shinden are not clearly known, but Shinden are believed to have already existed before 646. Even when the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ritsuryo.html">Ritsuryo</a> system (a system of centralized government based on the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ritsuryo.html">ritsuryo</a> codes) was established in the late seventh century and rice fields were integrated into <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kubunden (a term related to fields).html">Kubunden</a> (rice fields allotted to people by the central government) under the Handen Shuju no ho Law (the law of rice field allotment system), Shinden and Jiden (rice fields owned by temples) were exempted from the law. This exemption was made based on the belief that Shinden and Jinden were not the property of Shrines and Temples, but of deities. Therefore, the buying and selling of Shinden and Jiden, which were considered the property of deities, was prohibited. </p>
<p>Under the Taiho Ritsuryo Code and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yoro Ritsuryo Code.html">Yoro Ritsuryo Code</a> (code promulgated in the Yoro period) established in the eighth century, Shinden was stated in Jingiryo (the part of the code that dealt with all matters relating to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a>) and Denryo (the law about providing rice fields). According to the laws, in order to cultivate Shinden, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Jinko (agarwood).html">Jinko</a> (the administrative households that was considered as belonging to deities) was stipulated and Soyocho system (a tax system, corvee) imposed on <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Jinko (agarwood).html">Jinko</a> was supposed to be used for the purpose of building and managing shrines and to be exempted from Handen Shuju no ho Law. That is, in the laws Shinden was defined as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Fuyusoden.html">Fuyusoden</a> (tax-exempted rice field). </p>
<p>The concept to regard Shinden as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Fuyusoden.html">Fuyusoden</a> led to the increase of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shoen.html">Shoen</a> (privately owned manors) in the Heian period. Since <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Fuyu no ken (Japan).html">Fuyu no ken</a> (the right to tax exemption) was granted to Shinden even after the collapse of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ritsuryo System.html">Ritsuryo System</a> from the eighth to ninth century, Tato (dominant farmers or lords cultivating new rice fields) who were then collecting rice fields around them tried to obtain Fuyu no ken Right by donating their rice fields to shrines or temples. Therefore many <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shoen.html">Shoen</a> manors were contributed to dominant shrines or temples. </p>
<p>After that, from the 11th century through the 13th century with the establishment of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shoen.html">Shoen</a> koryo sei (The System of Public Lands and Private Estates), Shinden was positioned as one of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Joden.html">Joden</a> (tax-exempted rice fields) of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shoen.html">Shoen</a> or <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kokuga (provincial government office compounds).html">Kokuga</a> (local government office)<br/>
The tax imposed on Shinden was not regarded as the income of the Lord of the manor, but was used for shrines' religious services or festivals. This custom continued through history and even today many <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> shrines have Shinden or Omita as the rice fields to offer Kugo (food for deities). <h3>Place name and Family name</h3>
</p>
