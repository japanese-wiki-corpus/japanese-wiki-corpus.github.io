<p>The <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Naginata.html">naginata</a> jutsu is a Japanese martial art using a long-handled sword called <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Naginata.html">naginata</a> which originated in Heian period. Please see '<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Naginata.html">naginata</a>' as in the form of a modern martial art. </p>
<p><h3><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Naginata.html">Naginata</a></h3>
</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Naginata.html">naginata</a> usually has a 212.1cm long shaft and 30.3cm long blade, and since it was developed from a Japanese style sword by attaching a shaft, it remains some characteristics of a sword like a handguard and an oval-shaped cross-section of a shaft. It is usually named after a woman when given a name. </p>
<p>Although it is described as a sword above, there are various theories about the exact origin of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Naginata.html">naginata</a>, and many remains unknown. </p>
<p>Nagamaki is a similar type of weapon. However, while the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Naginata.html">naginata</a> is a "long-handled weapon" which focuses on maximizing the damage, the nagamaki is a "sword" which focuses on outreaching an enemy by having a longer shaft. <h3>Name</h3>
</p>
<p>It used to be spelled as '奈木奈多' or '長刀' in the early days; however, '薙刀' meaning slashing people and horses became more common in order to distinguish with '長刀' meaning a long sword. The character '薙' has a meaning of slashing something or someone by moving a sword sideways. However, '長刀 ' was commonly used in martial arts. <h3>Various kinds of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Naginata.html">Naginata</a></h3>
</p>
<p>There are various kinds of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Naginata.html">naginata</a> such as konaginata, hirumaki <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Naginata.html">naginata</a> and double-edged <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Naginata.html">naginata</a>. However, when they are simply classified based on size, there are only two types; onaginata (can be up to three meters long) and konaginata (around one meter long). The <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Naginata.html">naginata</a> used by men is called Shizuka model named after <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Shizuka Gozen.html">Shizuka Gozen</a>, and when it is used by women, it is called Tomoe model named after Tomoe Gozen. The Shizuka model has a less curve. The Tomoe model has a big curve which enables to slash an enemy with less power. Moreover, there are <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Naginata.html">naginata</a> used by the Army and the Marines; the one used by the Army has a long shaft in order to cut horse legs while an enemy is still on the horse. The one used by the Marines has a short shaft due to limited space on the ship and an unique shaped ferrule for storage purpose. There are not many <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Naginata.html">naginata</a> of this type, and they are very rare. <h3>Onaginata</h3>
</p>
<p>Although long Japanese swords are still left today as they were offered to shrines, Onaginata is hardly any left. </p>
<p>Nikko Toshogu Shrine<br/>
Blade length 65.9 cm, curve 3.0 cm, shaft 77.7 cm<br/>
<h3>History</h3>
</p>
<p>A painting of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> from <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period (the collection of Museum of Fine Arts, Boston)<br/>
It shows a few people holding <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Naginata.html">naginata</a>. </p>
<p>After Chinese style swords were brought from ancient China and transformed into Japanese style, the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Naginata.html">naginata</a> came to exist as the fighting method shifted from mounted warriors with bows and arrows to foot soldiers. It was widely used as a weapon by monk soldiers to protect their temples during Nara period and Heian period. It became the most commonly used weapon in the battle field during <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period and Muromachi period. However, the fighting method changed to close-up fighting by foot soldiers (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Ashigaru.html">ashigaru</a>) after <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Onin War.html">Onin War</a>, and the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Naginata.html">naginata</a> was eventually replaced with spears. </p>
<p>Although it temporally disappeared due to the order issued by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Edo bakufu.html">Edo bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>) which banned <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> to carry the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Naginata.html">naginata</a> during Edo period, it came back as a martial art for women. Because of this, different schools of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Naginata.html">naginata</a> designed for women were established, and the sword shows held in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period became quite popular. It became a martial art mainly for women from Taisho period to post war period and is till practiced as '<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Naginata.html">Naginata</a>' in modern day. </p>
<p>Various types of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Naginata.html">naginata</a> jutsu for men were also established and is still practiced now. <h3>Traditional performing arts</h3>
</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Naginata.html">naginata</a> form was adopted into the traditional performing arts such as the Noh theater, Bonote, Tachifuri (swinging of the sword) and Sasara dance (sasara is a Japanese traditional percussion instrument). </p>
