<h1>Han (藩)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Han refers to the territories ruled by lords. </p>
<p>Han in Japan<br/>
Han in terms of Japanese history is a historical term that refers to the territories ruled by <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> (Japanese feudal lords) who possessed a domain of 10,000 or more goku crop yields in the Edo period and the governance structure. Han derives from the Chinese name of a Chinese system to which Japanese Confucian scholars in the Edo period compared Japanese system. </p>
<p>Term<br/>
Because the term Han was not the official name of a system in the Edo period, only some people used it, and it occasionally appeared after Genroku era (e.g. Hakuseki ARAI's books "Hankanpu" [Genealogy of the Protectors of the Shogunate] and "Tokugawa jikki" [The True Tokugawa Records].)<br/>
Han became a public name in the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period, and then it came into widespread use. </p>
<p>Originally, the term 'Han' referred to the territories ruled by the lords who were allowed to govern a certain country by the emperors of the Zhou Dynasty, ancient China, and the Japanese Confucian scholars in the Edo period compared the Japanese system to this, calling the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> who were (thought to be) subject to the TOGUGAWA <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun family.html">Shogun family</a> and given the territories by the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> '<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Shoko.html">Shoko</a>,' and their domains 'Han.'<br/>
In the Edo period, the term 'Han' was a nickname in Confucian literature so that it was not used in official systems and other names, such as 'XX kachu (family),' were used instead. </p>
<p>In modern historical terms, the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> who were feudal lords of Han are called 'Hanshu', and the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a>'s vassals were called '<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Hanshi.html">Hanshi</a>.'<br/>
In addition, direct control territories of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>) are called '<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Tenryo (Shogunal Demesne).html">Tenryo</a>' in modern historical terms in comparison to Han, and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Daikan (local governor).html">Daikan</a> (local governor) or <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Gundai.html">Gundai</a> (intendant of a region or administrator of a town) collected land taxes there. </p>
<p>However, for instance, retainers of the governor in Mutsu Province were rarely called 'Sendai <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Hanshi.html">Hanshi</a>' in the Edo period, and they were officially called 'Matsudaira Mutsu no kami no Kerai' (retainers of the governor of Mutsu Province) (the Date family was given the cognomen of 'Matsudaira' by the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> family.)<br/>
In addition, many <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> families preferred to call themselves 'Soshi' rather than '<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Hanshi.html">Hanshi</a>', both were of Chinese origin. </p>
<p>In many cases, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> were called by their domain names with 'Ko' (lord), rather than 'Hanshu.'<br/>
For example, 'Sendai Ko,' 'Owari Ko,' and 'Himeji Ko'. </p>
<p><h3>Edo period</h3>
</p>
<p>Certain self-sustained politics, economy and society were well organized inside Han within a framework of the authority of the seii taishogun (literally, "great general who subdues the barbarians") and the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Edo bakufu.html">Edo bakufu</a>, so the inside of Han functioned like a small country. </p>
<p>Han started when <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a> <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> (Japanese territorial lords) dismantled manors and employed local lords-grade <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> who had owned a territory in each farming village and the village headmen who had become local <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> as their vassals, firmly building a system to rule the whole region in their territory. It was a new control pattern that was different from the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a>'s control over their territory before the Muromachi period. While the Sengoku <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> further pushed to rule the whole region in their territory, they started to gather their vassals, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a>, in their castle town and bring the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> under their tight control. <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Nobunaga ODA.html">Nobunaga ODA</a> continuously moved the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a>'s territories that Nobunaga exacted according to their power and progress, and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI.html">Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI</a> made the Sengoku <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> that Hideyoshi subjugated, including <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Ieyasu TOKUGAWA.html">Ieyasu TOKUGAWA</a>, move in their entirety from their base territory to a new fief. Therefore, the separation of the occupations and social ranks between <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> and peasants progressed in the Azuchi-Momoyama period, and it was completed by the Battle of Sekigahara and by actively adding or changing Daidaimyo's (a feudal lord having a greater stipend) territories in the early Edo period. </p>
<p>The typical pattern of Han was to have <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a>, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Hanshi.html">Hanshi</a>, in the castle town as military men or government officials who collected land taxes in rice from peasants whose yields were registered in villages located in the whole ruling region in the vicinity of the castle town, and divided the taxes into the financial resources for the Han and Hanshu as well as the salaries for the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Hanshi.html">Hanshi</a>. However, among small domains newly organized by the Tokugawa clan, some had separate territories which lay astride other domains and ruling the whole region was difficult for them. <h3><a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period</h3>
</p>
<p>When the new <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> government regionalized the former territories of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> into prefectures called Fu or Ken as the direct control territories of the emperor (<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Tenryo (Shogunal Demesne).html">tenryo</a>) in 1868, 'Han' was newly adopted as an official name for the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a>'s domains because the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a>'s domains were thought to be the emperor's 'Han', so 'XX Han' became the official way of calling administrative divisions, with the 'XX' for the Hanshu's location (or castle, if <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> had one) (fu-han-ken sanchisei [fu-han-ken tripartite governance system].)<br/>
By the following year, 1869, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> returned their lands and people to the emperor and their title was changed from Hanshu to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Chihanji (governor in the early Meiji period).html">Chihanji</a> (governor,) and based on the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Haihan-chiken (abolition of feudal domains and establishment of prefectures).html">Haihan-chiken</a> (the abolition of feudal domains and establishment of prefectures) in 1871, Han were replaced with prefectures. Consequently, the fief system since the Edo period was abolished, and the lands of the domains were consolidated. </p>
<p>In 1872, a year after the Satsuma Domain, the practical ruler of Ryukyu, became Ken by the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Haihan-chiken (abolition of feudal domains and establishment of prefectures).html">Haihan-chiken</a>, Ryukyu was changed from an independent kingdom to the Ryukyu Domain which belonged to Japan. From then to the Ryukyu Annexation in 1879, Ryukyo was the only area to stay under the fief system in Japan after the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Haihan-chiken (abolition of feudal domains and establishment of prefectures).html">Haihan-chiken</a>. </p>
<p>Today's prefectures were formed by integrating the prefectures at the time of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Haihan-chiken (abolition of feudal domains and establishment of prefectures).html">Haihan-chiken</a>, but in the cases of large scale domains which had social status of landed <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a>, their territories are rarely identical with those of today's prefectures. </p>
<p>Han in China<br/>
It is said that the term Han derives from the fact that the lords who guarded the royal family were called 'Han' in ancient China during the Zhou dynasty. Later, Han came to refer to the lords and their territories, whose country was in a vassal relationship with the Chinese empire. The territories were also called Hankoku (a.k.a. Bankoku). </p>
<p>The term Han was used from the Han dynasty to the Qing Dynasty, but it was rarely used to form a proper noun like ' XX Han' in Japan. </p>
<p><a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Hanchin.html">Hanchin</a> was the name used to call jiedushi forces (a regional military governor) who ruled their own territories in regional areas from the late Tang Dynasty to the Wudai Shiguo period. </p>
<p>The Three Han that were remote semi-independent states in the Qing Dynasty are well-known. <h3>Han in India and Pakistan</h3>
