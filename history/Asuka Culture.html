<p></p>
<p>Asuka Culture was a Buddhist culture that flourished mainly in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Yamato Province.html">Yamato Province</a> under <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Empress Suiko.html">Empress Suiko</a>. It generally covers the era from the introduction of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Buddhism in Japan.html">Buddhism in Japan</a> through the Taika Reforms. </p>
<p>It was an abundantly cosmopolitan culture, influenced by the Northern and Southern Dynasties period culture of the Chinese continent, which was introduced to Japan via the Korean kingdoms of Baekje and Goguryeo. It was the first prosperous period of Buddhist culture and saw the construction of many large temples. </p>
<p><h3>Buddhist culture</h3>
</p>
<p>Buddhism was officially introduced into Japan via Baekje either during the reign of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Senka.html">Emperor Senka</a> in 538 or the reign of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Kinmei.html">Emperor Kinmei</a> in 552. According to the "<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan).html">Nihonshoki</a>" (Chronicles of Japan), the introduction of Buddhism into Japan was spearheaded by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/SOGA no Iname.html">SOGA no Iname</a>, who enshrined a gilt bronze statue of Shakyamuni that had been presented, together with some sutras, to the Imperial court by King Seong of Baekje, in his house at Oharida and purified his house in Mukuhara, converting it into Kogen-ji Temple. </p>
<p>A dispute over the adoption of Buddhism between the Soga clan, who had greatly contributed to dissemination of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Buddhism in Japan.html">Buddhism in Japan</a>, and their opponents, the Mononobe clan led to conflict between <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/SOGA no Umako.html">SOGA no Umako</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MONONOBE no Moriya.html">MONONOBE no Moriya</a>. Following the Soga's victory, Buddhist culture developed under the Soga clan and the clan-affiliated <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Okimi (great king) (Yamato sovereignty).html">Okimi</a> (King, a term used before "Emperor" became common), mainly in and around the capital <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Asuka-kyo (the Capital of Asuka).html">Asuka-kyo</a>, home to the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Yamato.html">Yamato</a> royalty. </p>
<p>Buddhism in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Asuka (飛鳥 in Chinese characters, the name of present-day Asuka Village, Nara Prefecture).html">Asuka</a> was supported by monks from Baekje and Goguryeo. In 595, two monks, Eji from Goguryeo and Eso from Baekje, arrived in Japan and became naturalized. The next year, they began living in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Asuka-dera Temple.html">Asuka-dera Temple</a>. <h3>Buddhist architecture</h3>
</p>
<p>Contrary to the intentions of devotees, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Asuka-dera Temple.html">Asuka-dera Temple</a> and Shitenno-ji Temple became state-administered temples. Craftsmen engaged in the construction of Buddhist temples and statures in Japan were mainly settlers from Korea and their descendants. In 594, following the issue of an imperial decree promoting Buddhism, many powerful clans competed to build private temples (known as uji-dera) for the Emperor and their ancestors. </p>
<p>Shitenno-ji Temple<br/>
Naniwa (Osaka)<br/>
This was founded by Prince Shotoku as the first fully-fledged state-sponsored temple in Japan. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Hoko-ji Temple.html">Hoko-ji Temple</a> (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Asuka-dera Temple.html">Asuka-dera Temple</a>, Ango-in)<br/>
Construction began in 588 during the reign of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Sushun.html">Emperor Sushun</a> and was completed in 596 during the reign of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Empress Suiko.html">Empress Suiko</a>. The central figure in the construction was <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/SOGA no Umako.html">SOGA no Umako</a>. The tera no <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Tsukasa (a rank in government offices).html">tsukasa</a> (head official of the temple) was Umako's eldest son, Zentoku. Although it was the first full-scale private temple in Japan, it strongly resembled a state-owned temple due to the support it received from the Soga clan-controlled royal family. </p>
<p>The temple's design resembled that of Shitenno-ji Temple, with the Nanmon (South Gate), Chumon (Central Gate), pagoda, kondo (main hall) and kodo (lecture hall) running in a straight line from south to north. It had two additional kondo situated to the east and west of the pagoda, with a corridor from the Chumon Gate that went around them and converged behind the kondo. The site of the main kondo is now occupied by the Ango-in Hall, which houses the Kondo-butsu or Asuka Daibutsu (a gilt bronze statue of Buddha in a sitting position), believed to have been made by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/KURATSUKURI no Tori.html">KURATSUKURI no Tori</a>. </p>
<p>According to the "<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan).html">Nihonshoki</a>," Buddha's ashes were buried under the central foundation stone of the pagoda in 593. Following its construction, most imperial palaces were built in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Asuka (飛鳥 in Chinese characters, the name of present-day Asuka Village, Nara Prefecture).html">Asuka</a> area centered around <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Asuka-dera Temple.html">Asuka-dera Temple</a>. The central line (middle road) between <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Asuka-dera Temple.html">Asuka-dera Temple</a>'s central axis and that of Kawahara-dera Temple, which was built in the last year of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Tenchi (Tenji).html">Emperor Tenchi</a>'s reign or the first year of Emperor Tenmu's reign, became one of standards in the design of Emperor Tenmu's capital, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Fujiwara-kyo.html">Fujiwara-kyo</a>, and the distance between both axial lines became a standard measurement of grid lines for allotment of land in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Asuka (飛鳥 in Chinese characters, the name of present-day Asuka Village, Nara Prefecture).html">Asuka</a>. </p>
<p>Kudara-daiji Temple<br/>
This was the Imperial Family's first Buddhist temple, completed in 639 by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Jomei.html">Emperor Jomei</a> and, after his death, succeeded by his consort, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Empress Kogyoku..html">Empress Kogyoku</a>, and his son, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Tenchi (Tenji).html">Emperor Tenchi</a>. It is now identified with the site of Kibiike Abandoned Temple. When completed, Kudara-daiji Temple far surpassed the scale of the Soga clan's <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Asuka-dera Temple.html">Asuka-dera Temple</a>. It was one of the top temples in East Asia at the time, with its towering nine-story pagoda, equivalent to a modern twenty-five story building, two times higher than Horyu-ji Temple's five-story pagoda. </p>
<p>Ikuraga-dera Temple (Horyu-ji Temple)<br/>
It was built at the wish of Prince Shotoku. It is the oldest wooden building in Japan. </p>
<p>Hata-dera Temple (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Koryu-ji Temple.html">Koryu-ji Temple</a>)... Hata clan<br/>
Shibukawa-ji Abandoned Temple... Mononobe clan (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Omuraji (ancient Japan).html">Omuraji</a> no Moriya), in Shibukawa-cho, Yao City, Osaka Prefecture<br/>
<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/The Mononobe clan.html">The Mononobe clan</a> also became Buddhist. Stories of the disputes over the worship or abolishment of Buddhism were handed down by the Soga clan, but there really existed a struggle for political power between <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/SOGA no Umako.html">SOGA no Umako</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MONONOBE no Moriya.html">MONONOBE no Moriya</a>. </p>
<p>Mineoka-ji Temple... Kadono, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto City.html">Kyoto City</a><br/>
Sakata-dera Temple... Minamibuchi, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Asuka-mura (Asuka Village).html">Asuka-mura</a><br/>
Although some Nara period structural platforms have been excavated, no remnants from the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Asuka (飛鳥 in Chinese characters, the name of present-day Asuka Village, Nara Prefecture).html">Asuka</a> period have been found. </p>
<p>Toyura-ji Temple... <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/SOGA no Emishi.html">SOGA no Emishi</a><br/>
<h3>Sculptures</h3>
</p>
<p>Northern Wei style... Introduced via Goguryeo<br/>
This style was characterized by solemn and majestic masculine figures with apricot kernel-shaped eyes, lips of a sharp crescent shape and symmetric and geometric patterns on their clothes. </p>
<p>Statue of Shakyamuni at Asuka-ji Temple (also known as the Asuka-daibutsu)<br/>
Made by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/KURATSUKURI no Tori.html">KURATSUKURI no Tori</a>.

<h3>Others</h3>
</p>
<p>The "Sangyogisho" (Three Sutra Annotations) is believed to have been written by Prince Shotoku who was deeply committed to Buddhism. The quote on Tenjukoku Mandara Shucho (a piece of embroidered silk) 'the real world is false and temporary, only the Buddha is true' is said to show how Prince Shotoku was feeling in his later life. </p>

Embroideries, brocades and other dyed or woven fabric works of Buddhist images have been handed down from generation to generation. </p>
<p>Throughout the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Asuka (飛鳥 in Chinese characters, the name of present-day Asuka Village, Nara Prefecture).html">Asuka</a> area, there can be found many stone objects such as the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Saruishi (Monkey stone; unusual shaped rocks in the tomb of Kibitsu-hime no Okimi).html">Saruishi</a> (Monkey Stones), Doso-jin (travelers' guardian deity) carved form stone and Tachibana-dera Temple's Nimen-ishi (Double-faced Stone), all of which are considered religious relics. <h3>Other legacies</h3>
