<h1>Shinchogumi (新徴組)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The Shinchogumi was a security force established by the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Edo bakufu.html">Edo bakufu</a> (a Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>) in 1862, during the late Edo period. In February of the same year, members of the Roshi-gumi, an organization of masterless samurais, were recruited in Edo and dispatched to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. Subsequently, they returned to Edo led by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Hachiro KIYOKAWA.html">Hachiro KIYOKAWA</a>, but after Kiyokawa was assassinated in April, the Roshi-gumi was reorganized as the Shinchogumi by the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Edo bakufu.html">Edo bakufu</a>, and they maintained vigilance inside Edo City and served as the naval defense and guard. </p>
<p>They were quartered at <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Honjo (proprietor or guarantor of manor).html">Honjo</a> in Edo (the present-day Sumida Ward, Tokyo). They came under the custody of the Shonai clan in 1864. The organization was dissolved when the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Edo bakufu.html">Edo bakufu</a> ceased to exist by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Taisei Hokan (transfer of power back to the Emperor).html">Taisei Hokan</a> (the Return of Political Power to the Emperor) and Osei Fukko (the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Restoration of Imperial Rule (Japan).html">Restoration of Imperial Rule</a>). </p>
<p>They had a relationship with the Shinsengumi (Tokugawa shogunate police force located in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>), because <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Rintaro OKITA.html">Rintaro OKITA</a>, who was the headman of this group, was an elder brother-in-law of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Soji OKITA.html">Soji OKITA</a>, who was one of the senior members of the Shinsengumi. </p>
