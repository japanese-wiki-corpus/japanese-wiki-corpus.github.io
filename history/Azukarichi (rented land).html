<h1>Azukarichi (rented land) (預地)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>"Azukarichi" (or "Azukechi") indicates the land a person has entrusted to another person to keep and manage. </p>
<p>Originally, "azukarichi" referred to shared land or land remaining after allocation had been made, to land that the land owner entrusted as a favor to its kosakunin (tenant farmers) free of charge (or for a small fee) or to forest area land owned by villages. However, it was more commonly used to refer to land that was in the direct territories of the Edo bafuku (called <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Tenryo (Shogunal Demesne).html">Tenryo</a>) but whose control was actually entrusted to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">Daimyo</a> (feudal lords), <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Hatamoto (direct retainers of shogun).html">Hatamoto</a> (direct retainers of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>) or ongoku-bugyo (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Edo bakufu.html">Edo bakufu</a> government officers placed outside Edo), who were otherwise called Azukari-dokoro. </p>
<p>This was derived from the kurairichi (lands under direct rule of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> or <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a>) system that was employed by Sengoku <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> (daimyo in the Sengoku period) and the Toyotomi government and also adopted by the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Edo bakufu.html">Edo bakufu</a>. Then the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> entrusted as Azukarichi the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> territories gained after the Battle of Sekigahara to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">Daimyo</a> who were made to govern instead, and the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> gained the land tax income. The land was entrusted for three to five years, but there were also cases of Azukarichi where the period for entrustment was unspecified. The operation to govern the land itself was entrusted to the clan, and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Nengu (Land Tax).html">nengu</a> (land tax) rice crop from the land was placed in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> rice warehouses in key areas, after a portion of the yearly contribution was nominally given to clans such as Kuchimai or Kuchinaga. However, in the areas where lots of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> territories were located, such as the Kanto region, the land was not entrusted to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> (feudal lords) but rather controlled by the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daikan (local governor).html">daikan</a> (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> government officers sent to those <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> territories) for those areas. Most of the land entrusted was in areas far from major cities such as Edo. The clans to whom such land was entrusted were limited to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/family/Shinpan (Tokugawas relatives).html">Shinpan</a> (clans whose lords were a relative of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> family), fudai-daimyo (whose family was a retainer of the Tokugawa family from before the Battle of Sekigahara), and fairly large clans of tozama <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> (nonhereditary feudal lord), such as Kanazawa and Anotsu, who were deeply trusted by the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>. Furthermore, the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> consistently avoided increasing the number of custodians, aiming to switch control through the local governors of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> as far as possible, and once, in 1713, abolished all of the custodians, switching the control of the area to that by local governors. However, because it was impossible to place a local governor in every remote area, the system of Azukarichi was restored seven years later. Even so, the ratio of Azukarichi in all <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> territories was restricted to 10% to 20%. For example, in 1757, the amount of rice crop from all <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> territories was 4.42 million koku (approx. 180 litres/koku), compared with 580,000 for the Azukarichi. </p>
