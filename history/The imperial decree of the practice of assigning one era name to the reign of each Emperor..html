<h1>The imperial decree of the practice of assigning one era name to the reign of each Emperor. (一世一元の詔)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The imperial decree of the practice of assigning one era name to the reign of each Emperor is an imperial decree established on October 23, 1868 (the Gregorian calendar) at the same time of changing Keio year 4 to Meiji gannen (Year of 1868) and it is a system for assigning one era name for each Emperor's reign. It is also referred to as the imperial decree of changing the name of the era to Meiji. </p>
<p>Summary<br/>
