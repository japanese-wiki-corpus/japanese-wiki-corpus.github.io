<h1>Fu-han-ken sanchisei (fu-han-ken tripartite governance system) (府藩県三治制)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Fu-han-sanchisei is a local administration system established in the first year of the Meiji Era. </p>
<p>Outline<br/>
In 1868, the Constitution of 1868 was issued, which abolished courts of law (local system) set up in regions formerly under the direct management of the Tokugawa Shogunate after the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Meiji Restoration (Meiji-ishin).html">Meiji Restoration</a>, denominated regions formerly governed by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Jodai (Castellan).html">Jodai</a> (chamberlain), <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kyoto Shoshidai.html">Kyoto Shoshidai</a> (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> deputy), and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Bugyo.html">bugyo</a> (magistrate) as "fu" and the rest of the regions as "ken," assigned Chifuji "prefectural governor) to "fu" and Chikenji (prefectural governor) to "ken," and allowed han (domains) to be governed by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> as before the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Meiji Restoration (Meiji-ishin).html">Meiji Restoration</a>. After Hanseki <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Hokan (Professional entertainer).html">Hokan</a> (return of the lands and people to the Emperor) in 1869, the tripartite local administration system was established, making han domains become also administrative divisions of the national government, and former feudal lords (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a>) were assigned to prefectural governors. Prefectural governors were local officials appointed by the central government, and the territories of the former han areas were not "shoryo (territory)" whose ownership was approved by the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> but "jurisdictional areas" which the governors were ordered by the central government to govern. Control of han by the central government was tightened as evidenced by the "fief system" established in 1870 to force a nation-wide unification of han organizations, and at the same time, since the financial condition of domain administration was worsened, domain governments who requested abolition of "han" appeared one after another. In 1871, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Haihan-chiken (abolition of feudal domains and establishment of prefectures).html">Haihan-chiken</a> (abolition of feudal domains and establishment of prefectures) finally abolished "han" domains, and the prefectural system was fully in place. </p>
<p>Prefectures established before <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Haihan-chiken (abolition of feudal domains and establishment of prefectures).html">Haihan-chiken</a>. * Prefectures in bold face are "fu," and those with X at the end are prefectures that were present on the very date of July 14, 1871, when <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Haihan-chiken (abolition of feudal domains and establishment of prefectures).html">Haihan-chiken</a> was issued. The following regional division is based on the currently effective division. The 4th year of Keio is the first year of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> (1868). </p>

<p>Names and Jurisdictions<br/>
"Fu" and "ken" (prefectures) and "han" (domain) to which <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Chihanji (governor in the early Meiji period).html">Chihanji</a> was assigned were basically called by the place name of their respective capital place, such as Osaka-fu, Shinagawa-ken, or Yamaguchi-han. But there were still many prefectures that have detached territories outside a lump of areas around their capital. </p>
<p>For instance, Nirayama Prefecture, whose capital was placed at Nirayama town, Izu Province, (today's Izunokuni city), controlled territories under direct rule of the former Tokugawa Shogunate (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Tenryo (Shogunal Demesne).html">tenryo</a>) and hatamoto-governed territories located not only in Izu Province but also in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Sagami (poet).html">Sagami</a>, Musashi and Kai Provinces. On the other hand, in the Sagami Province (today's Kanagawa Prefecture) were located Ogasawara Domain and Oginoyama Domain that placed their capitals in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Sagami (poet).html">Sagami</a> as well as jurisdictions of neighboring Kanagawa Prefecture, Mutsuura Domain (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Musashi Province.html">Musashi Province</a>), Nirayama Prefecture (Izu Province), Karasuyama Domain (Shimotsuke Province, today's Tochigi Prefecture), and Nishi-ohira Domain in Mikawa Province (today's Aichi Prefecture). Such cases were found in large numbers in Kanto and Kinki areas where former Shogunate territories, hatamoto-dominated areas and domain territories were scatteringly located. </p>
<p>Although the national government tried to rationalize their control by exchanging and consolidating jurisdictions of fu, han and ken areas, only a part of such reform was realized until <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Haihan-chiken (abolition of feudal domains and establishment of prefectures).html">Haihan-chiken</a>, leaving almost no confusion of jurisdiction eliminated. It was after the nation-wide reorganization of "fu" and "ken" administration units from the end of October to November (old lunar calendar) in 1871 following the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Haihan-chiken (abolition of feudal domains and establishment of prefectures).html">Haihan-chiken</a> that a standardized jurisdictional system based on ryoseikoku (province) or gun (county) was established. </p>
