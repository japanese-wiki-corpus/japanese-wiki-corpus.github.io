Kinds of schools<br/>
From Chapter 20 there were provisions for elementary schools, such as Jinjo shogaku (ordinary elementary schools), elementary schools for girls, village elementary schools, elementary schools for the poor (also called Jinkei Gakko), private elementary schools, elementary schools for infants, and schools for disabled children. Ordinary elementary schools were divided into lower division of four years and upper division of four years. However, elementary schools for infants were not realized. </p>
<p>From Chapter 29 there were provisions for middle schools which were also divided into two levels: upper and lower divisions (3 years for each). The order also set up irregular middle schools, Kajuku (government-backed school operated by a scholar out of his home) and private middle schools as the equivalents of middle schools. </p>
<p>From Chapter 33 there were provisions for Shomin Gakko(evening vocational schools). It was provided that Shomin Gakko should include agricultural schools, interpretational schools, commercial schools and technical schools. </p>
<p>It was provided that universities as 'specialized schools for offering the highest level of education in various studies' have the departments of science, literature, law and medicine. </p>
<p>However, because it was inappropriate to the real situation for the heavy imposition on people and so on, the order was repealed and replaced by Kyoikurei (the 1879 Education Order) in 1879. </p>
