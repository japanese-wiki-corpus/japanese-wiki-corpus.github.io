<p></p>
<p>Gakusei<br/>
Gakusei (educational system) in a broad sense is school systems in general. It is described under the heading of "school systems." </p>
<p>Gakusei (the Education System Order: the Proclamation of the Grand Council of the State No. 214, 1872) in a narrow sense is the laws and regulations pertaining to education promulgated in 1872. It is to be explained in detail under this heading. </p>
<p>Gakusei (the Education System Order: the Proclamation of the Grand Council of the State No. 214, 1872) is the laws and regulations pertaining to education promulgated on August 3, 1872, which first established the school system in Japan. It was repealed in 1879 by the promulgation of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kyoikurei (the 1879 Education Order).html">Kyoikurei</a> (the 1879 Education Order: the Proclamation of the Grand Council of the State No. 40, 1879). </p>
<p>Summary<br/>
Gakusei' followed French educational system to adopt the school district system. Chapter 3 provided that the country be divided into 8 university districts: 8 universities in all, each of which be divided into 32 middle school districts: 256 middle schools in all, and each of which be divided into 210 elementary school districts: 53,760 elementary schools in all. The order was amended the following year with change of the number of university districts to 7 for the actual enforcement. </p>
<p>Daigaku Nanko (the Southern College of the University, a predecessor of the University of Tokyo), Kaiseijo and Kounkan became middle schools which belonged to the 1st university district, the 4th university district and the 6th university district respectively, and Daigaku Toko (the Eastern College of the University), Osaka Igakko (Osaka Medical School) and Nagasaki Igakko (Nagasaki Medical School) became the medical schools of each university district. </p>

Kinds of schools<br/>
From Chapter 20 there were provisions for elementary schools, such as Jinjo shogaku (ordinary elementary schools), elementary schools for girls, village elementary schools, elementary schools for the poor (also called Jinkei Gakko), private elementary schools, elementary schools for infants, and schools for disabled children. Ordinary elementary schools were divided into lower division of four years and upper division of four years. However, elementary schools for infants were not realized. </p>
<p>From Chapter 29 there were provisions for middle schools which were also divided into two levels: upper and lower divisions (3 years for each). The order also set up irregular middle schools, Kajuku (government-backed school operated by a scholar out of his home) and private middle schools as the equivalents of middle schools. </p>
<p>From Chapter 33 there were provisions for Shomin Gakko(evening vocational schools). It was provided that Shomin Gakko should include agricultural schools, interpretational schools, commercial schools and technical schools. </p>
<p>It was provided that universities as 'specialized schools for offering the highest level of education in various studies' have the departments of science, literature, law and medicine. </p>
<p>However, because it was inappropriate to the real situation for the heavy imposition on people and so on, the order was repealed and replaced by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kyoikurei (the 1879 Education Order).html">Kyoikurei</a> (the 1879 Education Order) in 1879. </p>
