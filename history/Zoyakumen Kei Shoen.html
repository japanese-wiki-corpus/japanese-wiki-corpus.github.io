<h1>Zoyakumen Kei <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shoen.html">Shoen</a> (雑役免系荘園)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The term "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Zoyakumen.html">Zoyakumen</a> kei <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a>" means <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> (manor) which were granted <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Zoyakumen.html">Zoyakumen</a> (the right to exempt from all levies other than regular land tax) and whose lords were allowed to secure the amount equivalent to zatsueki (odd-jobs tasks) for themselves. </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>Zatsueki, provided to temples/shrines, was originally provided by the nation as an allowance in kind. In the tenth century, however, it came to be financed by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shozei (the rice tax stored in provincial offices warehouse).html">shozei</a> (rice tax stored in provincial offices' warehouse) of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kokuga (provincial government office compounds).html">kokuga</a> (provincial government offices) and in the eleventh century, the system was established under which temples/shrines were allowed to directly collect zatsueki by obtaining <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kokuga (provincial government office compounds).html">kokuga</a>'s permission. The object lands under the above system were granted <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Zoyakumen.html">Zoyakumen</a> and became 'Zoyakumenden' (land exempted from zatsueki) (also called Fuden or <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Fumyo.html">Fumyo</a>), obliged to provide zatsueki to temples/shrines instead of the nation. Though the object lands were not fixed initially and called "Ukimen," the system called Jomen under which some land was fixed as Zoyakumenden established later. As a result, a constant relationship was created between temples/shrines and Zoyakumenden/farmers and such relationships became the seed of the development of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a>. Later, these lands were certified by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kokuga (provincial government office compounds).html">kokuga</a> as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a>. The term "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Zoyakumen.html">Zoyakumen</a> kei <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a>" refers to these <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a>. </p>
<p>Provided, however, that because of the process of their establishment, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kanmotsu.html">kanmotsu</a> (tributes goods paid as tax) was paid to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kokuga (provincial government office compounds).html">kokuga</a> as before though zatsueki was paid to temples/shrines, the lord of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a>. Due to the above, kendenken (the right of cadastral surveys) of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kokuga (provincial government office compounds).html">kokuga</a> was also maintained as before and the management of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> was unstable because of the intervention by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kokuga (provincial government office compounds).html">kokuga</a>. It is considered that the area of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Zoyakumen.html">Zoyakumen</a> kei <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> was bigger than that of Kikonchi kei <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> or Kishinchi kei <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> (shoen originated from donated land) because the certification of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kokuga (provincial government office compounds).html">kokuga</a> was easily obtained. From the beginning of the twelfth century, some of temples/shrines, the lord of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a>, began to seek ichienshihai (complete rule of the land) of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Zoyakumen.html">Zoyakumen</a> kei <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> and eventually obtained the right to collect <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kanmotsu.html">kanmotsu</a> as with the case of fuko (lands allotted to temples/shrines) called jiden (land allotted to temples) or <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shinden.html">shinden</a> (land allotted to shrines). However, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Zoyakumen.html">Zoyakumen</a> kei <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> still existed at various places during the twelfth century. <h3>Remarks</h3>
</p>
<p>The notion of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Zoyakumen.html">Zoyakumen</a> kei <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> was proposed by Yasuhiko MURAI in 1959. Initially <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Zoyakumen.html">Zoyakumen</a> kei <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> were regarded as the cases that were seen mainly in kinai region (provinces surrounding <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and Nara), but thanks to Keiichi KUDO's research on the cases in Kyushu, it is now believed that such cases were seen across the nation. </p>
