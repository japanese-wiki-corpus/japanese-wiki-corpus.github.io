<h1>Shuzeiryo (Bureau of Taxation) (主税寮)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Shuzeiryo refers to an institution that belonged to Minbusho (Ministry of Popular Affairs) in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ritsuryo.html">Ritsuryo</a> system (a system of centralized government based on the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ritsuryo.html">ritsuryo</a> code). This was called 'Chikara no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Tsukasa (a rank in government offices).html">Tsukasa</a>' in a Japanese way. </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>The Yoro <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ritsuryo.html">ritsuryo</a> code (code promulgated in the Yoro period) described that its major duties were 'taking out of and putting in a storage, denso (rice field tax) of various provinces, shomai (white rice which was the base unit in the fiscal administration under the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ritsuryo.html">Ritsuryo</a> system), and tengai (mill powered by the water).'<br/>
</p>
<p>While <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shukeiryo.html">Shukeiryo</a> (Bureau of Statistics) controlled the Central Finance by auditing the tax yields of cho (tributes), Shuzeiryo controlled local finance through auditing by verifying account books of land taxes (especially rice tax) and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Suiko.html">suiko</a> (government loans made to peasants). Therefore, Shuzeiryo existed for a long time even after the collapse of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ritsuryo.html">Ritsuryo</a> system. Since knowledge of mathematics was required, persons from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Sando.html">Sando</a> (study of mathematics) of Daigakuryo (Bureau of Education under the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ritsuryo.html">Ritsuryo</a> system) played active roles like Sanhakase (Doctor of Numbers) concurrently took a position as Kami (Director) or Suke (Deputy Director).
