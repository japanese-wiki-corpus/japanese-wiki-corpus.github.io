<h1>Roto (郎党)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Roto (郎党; retainer) or rodo was a family member or a follower of his master's house in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> society of medieval Japan. It was also written as 郎等 (roto). </p>
<p>A class of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> who had come from Johei Tengyo kunkosha (people who distinguishably served in the Johei and Tengyo War) or their descendants were also a Tato-fumyo (cultivator/tax manager), a rice field manager. They worked hard at their training of martial arts while managing rice field, and whenever mobilized for military by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kokuga (provincial government office compounds).html">kokuga</a> (provincial government offices) they participated in the military activities. Thus, they were acknowledged as local <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kokuga (provincial government office compounds).html">kokuga</a> and thereby obtained their status as a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a>. 
<br/>(the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kokuga (provincial government office compounds).html">kokuga</a> forces system)<br/>
</p>
<p>In order to maintain a certain level of fighting power, the above mentioned local <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> established the relation of master to servant with their followers who were called roto. Roto could not be declared as having equal status to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> but had the right to ride a horse like local <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> and the obligation to participate in battles. Some roto originated from lower ranked people or <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shoju.html">shoju</a> (retainers), and some were peasants who had formed a relation with a local warrior to become a roto. </p>
<p>Like roto, '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ienoko (Follower).html">ienoko</a>' (followers) followed <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> and participated in battles. The difference between the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ienoko (Follower).html">ienoko</a> and the roto was that the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ienoko (Follower).html">ienoko</a> was a family member or a son of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> and had a blood tie, while roto was not. </p>
<p>Sometimes a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> created master to servant relationships among <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> and became another <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a>'s roto. Around the eleventh century, as leading <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> like <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Yorinobu.html">MINAMOTO no Yorinobu</a> who should be called toryo (a leader) appeared, many <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> connected master to servant relationships with toryo and become roto for the toryo. </p>
