<h1>Bunkokuho (分国法)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Bunkokuho is a law established by warlords during the Sengoku period to govern their domains. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bunkoku.html">Bunkoku</a> is a term for lordship (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Chigyo.html">chigyo</a>) over one county in the middle ages and was originated from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Chigyo-koku.html">chigyo-koku</a>, which developed into the control of one county by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> or <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kokujin.html">kokujin</a>. As part of control over one county, Bunkokuho was established to control warriors and farmers within its county. </p>
<p>Bunkokuho was influenced by Goseibai <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shikimoku.html">Shikimoku</a> and Kenmu <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shikimoku.html">Shikimoku</a> while its contents reflected the actual conditions of control over one county. Main items that Bunkokuho regulated were control over farmers, discipline for retainers, control over temples and shrines, lawsuits about land, military service, and so on. </p>
