<p></p>
<p>Among <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Honke.html">honke</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Ryoke.html">ryoke</a>, both of which are the lords of the manor of Nihon-shoen (manor in medieval Japan), honjo was the lord that had the right to assert <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shomu.html">Shomu</a> (management and control of encouragement of agriculture, taxes and so on in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a>), or in other words, had the effective dominion over the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a>. </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>In the late Heian period, there were rapidly growing numbers of donated manors, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> donated to central nobles, temples or shrines by local lords asking for their protection of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> from shuko (confiscation) by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kokuga (provincial government office compounds).html">kokuga</a> (provincial government offices) and so on. There were even cases in which the nobles, the temples or the shrines that had received a donation from the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> further donated it to the more dominant nobles, temples or shrines in the upper-class. In the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> governing system formed in this way, the lords who had effective dominion over the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> were called honjo. In many cases, the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Honke.html">honke</a> became the honjo. In some cases, the lords of the manor in general, except for the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kokuga (provincial government office compounds).html">kokuga</a> and the lords of samurais, were called honjo. </p>
<p>Deriving from the above meaning of honjo, a person who assumed control over za (trade association) also came to be called honjo during the later medieval period (the Muromachi period). Closer to our own times, during the Edo period for instance, a Court noble, included in organizations of groups of every walks of life throughout the country, were also called honjo. Besides, some places governed by the honjo were also called "Honjo," and this is the reason why there are places named Honjo throughout Japan. Especially, Honjo in Sumida Ward, Tokyo Prefecture are famous for that. <h3>History</h3>
</p>
<p>In the middle of the Heian period, around the late tenth century to eleventh century, development and privatization of rice fields by locally influential farmers called Tato (cultivators) were accelerated. Owners of these developed rice fields were called <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kaihatsu-Ryoshu.html">kaihatsu-ryoshu</a> (local notables who actually developed the land) but their land ownership lacked legal basis and was so unstable that there was high possibility of the shuko by the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kokuga (provincial government office compounds).html">kokuga</a>. This made many <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kaihatsu-Ryoshu.html">kaihatsu-ryoshu</a> donate their <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> to dominant nobles, temples or shrines in central capital in order to secure the dominion and the management rights over the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a>. The recipient of such donations was called <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Ryoke.html">ryoke</a> (lord of the manor). </p>
<p>At that time, Manor Regulation Acts were often enforced as 'a new government' when a new emperor ascended the throne, and the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kokuga (provincial government office compounds).html">kokuga</a>, who did not admit the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a>, often tried to incorporate the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> into koryo (an Imperial demesne). As a result, in some cases, the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Ryoke.html">ryoke</a> authority alone could not maintain ownership of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a>. For that reason, the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Ryoke.html">ryoke</a> sometimes donated the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> to the Imperial family or Sekkan-ke (the families which produced regents), which had more authority than the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Ryoke.html">ryoke</a>. These lords of the manor at the top of the ownership chain were called <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Honke.html">honke</a>. </p>
<p>Among the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Honke.html">honke</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Ryoke.html">ryoke</a>, the lords of a manor that had effective dominion over the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a>, were called honjo. Among the lords of the manor who had multilayered structures, the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Honke.html">honke</a>, who often occupied the most advantageous position in the real world, became the honjo in many cases. However, even other lords of the manor, such as the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Ryoke.html">ryoke</a>, were also called honjo when they actually assumed the authority of administration and administration of justice at their <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a>, or in other words, the right to assert <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shomu.html">Shomu</a>. The honjo protected the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> from the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kokuga (provincial government office compounds).html">kokuga</a> or other <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> by exercising their own authority. In return, they gained a certain amount of profit from the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a>. In the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period, there were more cases in which lords of a manor were collectively called honjo by the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>) or <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a>. </p>
<p>The honjo was granted extensive authority because it could exercise real power over their <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a>. Therefore, a variety of services and obligations against the honjo, such as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Nengu (Land Tax).html">nengu</a> (land tax) and kuji (public duties) were called Honjo-yaku and regarded as the most significant among the burdens on people at the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a>. <h3>Honjo (proprietor or guarantor of manor) law</h3>
</p>
<p>The honjo, which had maintained effective dominion over the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a>, came to exercise its own jurisdiction over the management of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a>. As a result, a legal system independent from the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Ritsuryo.html">Ritsuryo</a> codes, the primary law, was developed to form a new legal system called honjo law. In the event of any dispute arising in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a>, a trial was held at the honjo's domestic governing institutions such as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Mandokoro.html">Mandokoro</a> (Administrative Board), and persons mainly concerned with the dispute and officials of the honjo participated. The honjo law, which was the applicable law in such cases, consisted of court noble law, descendant from the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Ritsuryo.html">Ritsuryo</a> codes, local common law, and other laws. The honjo law inflicted a variety of punishments, including punishment by seizing assets, such as asset forfeiture, as well as punishment by imprisonment or the curtailment of liberties, such as internment or banishment. However, the death penalty and punishment that involved pain, such as the capital punishment that involved using a blade, were rarely executed. </p>
