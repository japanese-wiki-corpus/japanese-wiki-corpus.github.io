<h1>Taihei-genpo (the silver coin in ancient Japan) (太平元宝)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Taihei-genpo refers to the silver coin in ancient times in Japan. A diamond-shaped hole was made in a circle. </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>Taihei-genpo was minted in 760 for the first time. The exchange rate with the currencies issued at the same time was set at 10 coins of Taihei-genpo for one coin of Kaiki-shoho (a gold coin). The currency was also equivalent of 10 coins of Mannen-tsuho (copper coin). </p>
<p>There was no case that Taihei-genpo was found in excavation and research, and only two coins that were handed down in a certain family and Toshodai-ji Temple was in existence in the Taisho period. However, the Chinese characters on both coins were '大平元宝' not correct '太平元宝,' so these were suspected of imitation. The engraved prints of these two coins were only handed down at present, and the real ones are missing. </p>
