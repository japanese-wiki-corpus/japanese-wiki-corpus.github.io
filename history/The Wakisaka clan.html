<h1>The Wakisaka clan (脇坂氏)</h1>
<p>The Wakisaka clan is a Japanese clan. </p>
<p>It originated in Wakisaka-sho, Azai County, Omi Province. First it took the name of Monobe, but later it assumed the new name of Fujiwara. 
<br/>The pattern of the kamon (family crest) is 'Wachigai' (a pattern with two or more rings hanging together)<br/>
Norimasa AZAI, the grandchild of Ikuhide (生秀) AZAI, who was the third son of Hidemasa AZAI, became a lower official there and took the name. Subsequently, Yasuharu, the son of the fifth generation, Yasuakira WAKISAKA, served the Oda clan and the Toyotomi clan continuously and gained fame as one of the Seven Spears of Shizugatake. The character that the clan used from generation to generation is '安' (yasu). </p>
<p>However, due to various reasons the second generation of the daimyo (Japanese territorial lord) Wakisaka clan, Yasumoto WAKISAKA, took an adopted heir from the Hotta clan; the bloodline from the first generation died out in the early stage, and the relationship with the Hotta clan became stronger. </p>
<p>During the Edo period, as tozama daimyo (daimyo who had not been vassals of Ieyasu in 1600) it was transferred several times, as follows: the Awaji Sumoto Domain, holding 30,000 koku -> the Iyo Ozu Domain holding 53,000 koku -> the Shinano Iida Domain, holding 5,5000 koku -> Harima Tatsuno Domain, holding 5,3000 koku (later 51,089 koku by division of succession). The class was negai fudai (quasi fudai daimyo) in the generation of Yasumasa WAKISAKA and was formally promoted to fudai daimyo (a daimyo in hereditary vassal to the Tokugawa family) in the generation of Yasutada WAKISAKA. It was a viscount during the Meiji period. </p>
