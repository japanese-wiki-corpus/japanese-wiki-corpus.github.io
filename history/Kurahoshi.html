<h1>Kurahoshi (蔵法師)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kurahoshi means manager of doso (pawnbrokers and moneylenders) in the Medieval Period of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. It was also called Yamahoshi (armed priest), Dozohoshi or Dozo bozu. </p>
<p>It originated as the priests in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Enryaku-ji Temple.html">Enryaku-ji Temple</a> who operated underground warehouses called doso and engaged in businesses like lending money at high rates of interest. In later years, it came to mean doso operated by common people under the protection of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Enryaku-ji Temple.html">Enryaku-ji Temple</a> by means of acquiring a position called Sanmonkunin, which was given to the servants whose <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Honjo (proprietor or guarantor of manor).html">honjo</a> (proprietor or guarantor of a manor) was a temple. There were frequent instances of insolent behavior: some made excessive profit by taking advantage of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Enryaku-ji Temple.html">Enryaku-ji Temple</a>'s authority, and some broke into residences of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kugyo.html">Kugyo</a> (top court officials) to bully them into paying a debt. Afterward, the Muromachi <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> put the doso in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> under its administration. Even after that, however, many owners of doso had Hottai (religious appearance) and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Nanori.html">Nanori</a> (specific Japanese rendering of Chinese characters used in names of persons especially priests) as the vestiges of Sanmonkunin. </p>
