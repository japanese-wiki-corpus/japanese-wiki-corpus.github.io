<h1>Kobu-ochoku juhakka-jo (Eighteen articles of Imperial court and shogunate legislation made by an Imperial order) (公武法制応勅十八箇条)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kobu-ochoku juhakka-jo was the name for eighteen articles which were said to be issued in September 1615 by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Ieyasu TOKUGAWA.html">Ieyasu TOKUGAWA</a> who received an imperial order from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Gomizunoo.html">Emperor Gomizunoo</a> to display in Shishin den inside the Imperial palace. 
<br/>In the present legal history however, it is considered as a 'forged legislation.'<br/>
</p>
<p>It was quoted in part one of the first volume of "Tokugawa kinrei ko" (Tokugawa Interdictory) that it was in the possession of the Suwa clan, and the articles were considered to have specified a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> government and peace for the whole nation. However, its contents were not in accordance with the legislation and ways of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>) at the time, and especially in article 18, 'Toei-zan' (Mt. Toei-zan) (sango [literally, "mountain name," which is the title prefixed to the name of a Buddhist temple] of Kanei-ji Temple) which could not have existed, was contained. There were many inconsistencies, such as the description on the Kanei-ji Temple that it was established in 1625 which was ten years after 1615, and that the temple was also named at this time by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Tenkai.html">Tenkai</a>. The existence of Kobu-ochoku juhakka-jo is being denied by the researchers of legal history of the present day, and it is assumed that the document was a apocryphal book which was created by the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Edo bakufu.html">Edo bakufu</a> to display its superiority in social position over the Kuge (court nobles) Government (Imperial Court). Furthermore, Tomohiko OKANO, a researcher, paid attention to the replacement of the meaning of Shogakuin Junnain ryo-in betto (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Shogakuin.html">Shogakuin</a>: private school of Ariwara family; Junnain: a family school named after the Summer Place of Emperor Junnna; betto: school chancellor) as a post of Kuge that originally had the social standing of Genji no chojya (chief of the Minamoto clan) to toryo (a leader of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> family) in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> class. He assumes that a person who made the forgery reflected plans of the Tokugawa Shogunate family to control the Kuge Government (Imperial Court) based on their social standing as Genjino <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Choja.html">Choja</a> (chief of the Minamonto Clan) on this monjo (written material). </p>
