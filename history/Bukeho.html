<h1>Bukeho (武家法)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Bukeho refers to a set of codes enforced on samurai society and on the military government during the medieval and the early modern times in Japan. </p>
<p>Originally, the bukeho was administered by samurai themselves in order to discipline samurai groups, which then developed as a set of codes that function separately from the kugeho (laws issued by the imperial court) and the honjoho (laws issued by proprietors or guarantors of manor). The Kamakura bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun) was the first government to enforce the bukeho in the form of statutory law, the Goseibai-shikimoku (code of conduct for samurai), which was inherited by the Kenmu Code enforced by Muromachi bakufu, the bunkokuho (the law individual sengoku-daimyo enforced in their own domain) enforced by daimyo (Japanese territorial lord) during the Sengoku Period, and the Buke Shohatto (code for the warrior households) as well as the hanpo (code for regional domains) enforced during the time of the Edo bakufu; the bukeho thus became the prototype of codes for the military government to control the nation and for the regional administrations to maintain the feudal system and the regional order within their domains. </p>
