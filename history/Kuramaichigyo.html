<h1>Kuramaichigyo (蔵米知行)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kuramaichichigyo, also known as Kuramaikyuyo, was a system in which the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Edo bakufu.html">Edo bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>) and domains provided kuramai (written as 蔵米 or in the case of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> as 廩米 - rice preserved in a depository) to their vassals as horoku (salary) instead of chigyo-chi (territory). Vassals who received this rice were called Kuramaidori. </p>
<p><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">Samurai</a> society was originally based on <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Jigatachigyo.html">Jigatachigyo</a> (feudal governments or domains providing land to retainers as salary), where lords would give a portion of their shoryo (territory) to vassals as their chigyo-chi. During the early Edo period, however, more and more lords gave up <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Jigatachigyo.html">Jigatachigyo</a> in favor of Kuramaichigyo; this was due to land ruling power being concentrated in the hands of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> (Japanese territorial lord) and the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Seii Taishogun.html">Seii Taishogun</a> (literally, "great general who subdues the barbarians"); it was also due to financial reasons, such as a decrease in income as a consequence of rice falling in price caused by competition between domains and vassals in annual rice tax sales. </p>
<p>Vassals received kuramai directly at first, but later on a system was adopted in which fudasashi (traders who received and sold kuramai on behalf of the government for a commission) would receive kuramai, sell it at an official price, then deduct the commissions and pay the proceeds to the vassals. </p>
<p>Due to reforms in the salary system accompanied by the return of the lands and people from the feudal lords to the Emperor in 1869, all types of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Jigatachigyo.html">Jigatachigyo</a>, including those of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a>, were banned and only Kuramaichigyo remained. However, this system was also completely abolished in 1876 by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Chitsuroku-shobun (Abolition Measure of Hereditary Stipend).html">Chitsuroku-shobun</a> (Abolition measure of Hereditary Stipend) after Haihan chiken. </p>
