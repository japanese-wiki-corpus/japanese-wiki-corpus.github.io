<h1>Tenka bushin (nationwide construction projects) (天下普請)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Tenka bushin was a type of public works projects which the Edo bakufu (shogunate) ordered daimyo throughout Japan to perform. Among the various types of tenka bushin, jokaku (castle or fortress) construction projects are the most famous, but the term tenka bushin includes various other types of public works projects, such as river-related construction projects and other infrastructure improvements. </p>
