<p><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Honjo (proprietor or guarantor of manor).html">Honjo</a> low was enacted and enforced by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Honjo (proprietor or guarantor of manor).html">honjo</a> (proprietor or guarantor of manor) for the purpose of ruling over their privately owned <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shoen.html">Shoen</a> (manor in medieval Japan) as part of their Shomuken (the authority of the jurisdiction and the administration of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shoen.html">Shoen</a>). </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>A class called 'lord of the manor' was established on the basis of stratified ruling structures composed of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shiki (a rank in government offices under ritsuryo system).html">Shiki</a> systems (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shiki (a rank in government offices under ritsuryo system).html">Shiki</a> is a unit or an agency of sharing revenues and rights commended by landowners or name holders in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shoen.html">Shoen</a> system). Among a variety of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shiki (a rank in government offices under ritsuryo system).html">shiki</a>, '<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Honjo (proprietor or guarantor of manor).html">Honjo</a>' exercised legal control over <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shoen.html">Shoen</a> with the authority to carry out <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shomu.html">Shomu</a> (management and control of encouragement of agriculture, taxes and so on in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shoen.html">Shoen</a>) or judicial, administrative and police activities (The word, '<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Honjo (proprietor or guarantor of manor).html">Honjo</a>' is also used when referring to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Ryoke.html">Ryoke</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Honke.html">Honke</a>, but it is not the original meaning of the word.). There were two main origins of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Honjo (proprietor or guarantor of manor).html">Honjo</a> law: one was in a legal structure that had governed the influential families called <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Honjo (proprietor or guarantor of manor).html">honjo</a>, which owned Shomuken (the authority of the jurisdiction and the administration of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shoen.html">Shoen</a>), and the other was the common law in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shoen.html">Shoen</a> that became approved by the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Honjo (proprietor or guarantor of manor).html">honjo</a>. In addition, there existed other laws that were enacted by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Honjo (proprietor or guarantor of manor).html">honjo</a> in keeping with the local circumstances. </p>
<p>In the time when the system of the ownership of all lands and serfs by the emperor was functioning, government officials including <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kokuga (provincial government office compounds).html">kokuga</a> (provincial government offices) exclusively owned judicial and administrative authorities. However, as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Fuyu no ken (Japan).html">Fuyu no ken</a> (the right of tax exemption) and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Funyu no ken (Japan).html">Funyu no ken</a> (the right to keep the tax agents from entering the property) were established upon the formation of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shoen.html">Shoen</a>, the government officials and their legal authorities were excluded from the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shoen.html">Shoen</a> and the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Honjo (proprietor or guarantor of manor).html">honjo</a> acquired the judicial and administrative rights instead. Nevertheless, as a matter of practice, among donators of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shoen.html">Shoen</a> or officers called <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shokan.html">shokan</a> who practically administered <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shoen.html">Shoen</a>, many served concurrently as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Zaichokanjin.html">zaichokanjin</a> (the local officials in Heian and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> periods). Therefore, there were few cases in which the influence of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kokuga (provincial government office compounds).html">kokuga</a> was totally excluded from the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shoen.html">Shoen</a>. Furthermore, many of the influential families that became the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Honjo (proprietor or guarantor of manor).html">honjo</a> had belonged to kuge (court noble), which presided over the management of government officials including the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kokuga (provincial government office compounds).html">kokuga</a>, or to temples and shrines which were avidly protected by the kuge. For this reason, the early <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Honjo (proprietor or guarantor of manor).html">honjo</a> law was often constrained by court noble law and Jisha-ho (laws regarding shrines and temples) that governed the classes to which the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Honjo (proprietor or guarantor of manor).html">honjo</a> had originally belonged as the influential families, as well as by regionally specific regulations, such as local common law or Kokurei (a common law based on actual state of affairs in each area), which was enacted by the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kokuga (provincial government office compounds).html">kokuga</a>. The <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Honjo (proprietor or guarantor of manor).html">honjo</a>'s statuses as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shiki (a rank in government offices under ritsuryo system).html">shiki</a> in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shoen.html">Shoen</a> and their influences over their own regions and the central government varied with each <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shoen.html">Shoen</a>. This makes it difficult to find an element common to all the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shoen.html">Shoen</a> in these respects. Additionally, in some cases, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Honjo (proprietor or guarantor of manor).html">honjo</a> law was divided into two different kinds of laws, Kamu-ho, which was enacted to regulate domestic economies for the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Honjo (proprietor or guarantor of manor).html">honjo</a> themselves, and Shoen-ho, which was directly applied to the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shoen.html">Shoen</a> ('Shoen-ho' also refers to another law which was enforced on <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shoen.html">Shoen</a> by the imperial court and shogunate), both of which were collectively called Hojo-law. Nevertheless, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Honjo (proprietor or guarantor of manor).html">honjo</a> laws were continuously enacted for the purpose of retaining the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shoen.html">Shoen</a> structure itself, maintaining the production system or the public order, and securing the stable supply of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Nengu (Land Tax).html">nengu</a> (land tax) and kuji (public duties). It was enforced by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shokan.html">shokan</a> (an officer governing <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shoen.html">Shoen</a>), who exchanged kishomon (sworn oath) and ukebumi (the reply) with the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Honjo (proprietor or guarantor of manor).html">Honjo</a>'s side including Kuge, such as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Keishi (household superintendent).html">Keishi</a> (household superintendent) and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Mandokoro.html">Mandokoro</a> (Administrative Board), and temples, such as Sango (three monastic positions with management roles at a temple). </p>
<p>In the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period, jito (manager and lord of manor) was adopted by the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>. </p>
<p>As a result, the discretionary power of the hojo law was reduced by the execution of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Taibon Sankajo.html">Taibon Sankajo</a> (three major tasks of peacekeeping) and jitouke (the contract system that the manor's owner entrusts a jito to manage his manor and pay the customs) by the jito. </p>
<p>In addition, the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> acquired the right to approve the domination over the whole region of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shoen.html">Shoen</a>, which rather allowed provincial constables to intervene into <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shoen.html">Shoen</a> as the representatives of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>. As a consequence, the role of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Honjo (proprietor or guarantor of manor).html">honjo</a> low became nothing more than a compliment to Buke-ho (the law system for the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> society and the military government), and the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Honjo (proprietor or guarantor of manor).html">honjo</a> law was abolished upon the dissolution of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> koryo sei (The System of Public Lands and Private Estates). </p>
