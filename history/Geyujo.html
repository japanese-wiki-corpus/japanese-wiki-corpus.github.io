<p>A geyujo is a document that, when an officer in a position is replaced with another person under the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Ritsuryo.html">Ritsuryo</a> system (a system of centralized government based on the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Ritsuryo.html">ritsuryo</a> code) in ancient Japan, was issued confirming the change necessary for continuing office duties. 
<br/>It was also called a geyu<br/>
During the Heian period and later, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kageyushi.html">kageyushi</a> conducted administrative audits based on geyujo. </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>No specification for geyujo was stipulated in the basic laws of Taiho Code and Yoro Code. However, shortly after that, the following system was introduced to supervise administration more thoroughly: When an officer was replaced with another person, the former officer made a document describing matters necessary for continuing office duties and handed it over to the new officer, and the new officer issued a certificate showing that he or she accepted the proper document. The certificate showing the acceptance of such a proper document was a geyujo. Only after submitting a geyujo to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shikibu-sho.html">Shikibu-sho</a> (the Ministry of Ceremonies), is the former officer able to assume the next official position. The new officer can not issue a geyujo when the predecessor had not yet completed his duty (for example, land tax had not been collected), and in such a case, a geyujo was issued only after the duty was completed (for example, the necessary land tax had been collected). </p>
<p>Although it was not clear when the geyujo system was introduced, a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Mikotonori.html">mikotonori</a> (imperial edict) for promoting the geyujo system was issued on May 26, 733 (according to "<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Shoku Nihongi (Chronicle of Japan Continued).html">Shoku Nihongi</a>" - Chronicle of Japan continued). This <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Mikotonori.html">mikotonori</a> included the description of the following situations: Although instructed to follow the geyu system thoroughly in 731, a former <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kokushi.html">kokushi</a> (provincial governor) at a province returned to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> before his successor arrived at the province, and the former officer could not be appointed to the new position because his successor did not issue a geyujo. Therefore, this <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Mikotonori.html">mikotonori</a> was issued to remind officers that they were responsible for issuing a geyujo and for submitting it to the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shikibu-sho.html">Shikibu-sho</a>. The geyu system described above was mostly concerned with <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kokushi.html">kokushi</a>, or more specifically, handing over a description of matters necessary for continuing office duties when a new <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kokushi.html">kokushi</a> was appointed. </p>
<p>Emperor Kanmu, who was an emperor from the end of the Nara period to the early Heian period, attempted to make <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kokushi.html">kokushi</a> perform his duties completely, and regulated in 782 that, if a government officer could not obtain a geyujo even after 120 days from when his successor arrived, the officer should be punished severely. Furthermore, the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kageyushi.html">kageyushi</a> position for checking geyujo was introduced in around 797. </p>
<p>After that, the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kageyushi.html">kageyushi</a> position was once abolished, but when it was introduced again (in 824), the geyujo system was changed considerably. Although formerly a geyujo was necessitated for <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kokushi.html">kokushi</a> alone, naikan (government officials in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>) as well became necessary to have a geyujo issued when they left their positions, and became audited by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kageyushi.html">kageyushi</a> as well. Regulations also covered when it was impossible to accept a description of matters necessary for continuing the office duties, in such case, the successor should issue a fuyogeyujo (literally, not giving a geyujo) instead of a geyujo, and the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kageyushi.html">kageyushi</a> should judge the situation. </p>
<p>By the way, in the Heian period, the act of a predecessor accepting a geyujo was called "<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Zuryo (The Head of The Provincial Governors).html">zuryo</a>." Basically, a geyujo was issued at the site of the office concerned. Therefore, the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kokushi.html">kokushi</a> who actually lived in his area of responsibility in order to control it directly, not one who lived in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and remotely controlled responsible area remotely, became called <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Zuryo (The Head of The Provincial Governors).html">zuryo</a>. </p>
<p>It is considered that geyujo functioned effectively during the first half of the Heian period. However, in the middle to the latter half of the Heian period, the trend of an office position monopolized by members of a specific family progressed, making geyujo for naikan gradually ineffective. Furthermore, in the first half of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period, control by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Zuryo (The Head of The Provincial Governors).html">zuryo</a> became existent in name only and geyujo for <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Zuryo (The Head of The Provincial Governors).html">zuryo</a> went out of existence as well. </p>
