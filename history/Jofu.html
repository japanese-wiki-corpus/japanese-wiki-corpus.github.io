<h1>Jofu (定府)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Jofu is a person in the Edo period who lived permanently in Edo and served seii taishogun (literally, "great general who subdued the barbarians") without performing Sankinkotai (a system under which feudal lords in the Edo period were required to spend every other year in residence in Edo). </p>

Many of jofu feudal retainers of domains had families and bodai-ji or danna-dera (family temples) in Edo, and if they died in Edo, their bodies and cremains were not brought back to their hometowns. </p>
<p>On the other hand, someone who returned to his hometown when the lord of domain performed Sankinkotai was called Edo-zume (working in Edo) and distinguished from jofu. </p>
