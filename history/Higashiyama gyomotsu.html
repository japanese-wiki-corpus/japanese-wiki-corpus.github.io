<h1><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Higashiyama (Kyoto Prefecture).html">Higashiyama</a> gyomotsu (東山御物)</h1>
<p></p>
<p><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Higashiyama (Kyoto Prefecture).html">Higashiyama</a> gyomotsu (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Higashiyama (Kyoto Prefecture).html">Higashiyama</a> gomotsu) refers to the paintings, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Chaki (tea utensils).html">chaki</a> (tea utensils), kaki (flower vase), stationery and other items collected by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshimasa ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshimasa ASHIKAGA</a>, the eighth seii taishogun (literally, "great general who subdues the eastern barbarians") of the Muromachi <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>). The term '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Higashiyama (Kyoto Prefecture).html">Higashiyama</a>' was taken from the name of the place <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Higashiyama (Kyoto Prefecture).html">Higashiyama</a> where Yoshimasa kept a mountain villa. However, the whole collection of the successive shoguns of the Muromachi <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> is sometimes called '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Higashiyama (Kyoto Prefecture).html">Higashiyama</a> gyomotsu,' as opposed to the collection of the successive shoguns of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Edo bakufu.html">Edo bakufu</a>, which is called 'Ryuei gomotsu' (the works of art for the tea ceremony passed down from the Tokugawa family). </p>
<p>Before the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period, names such as '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Higashiyama (Kyoto Prefecture).html">Higashiyama</a> dono gyomotsu' (東山殿御物), '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Higashiyama (Kyoto Prefecture).html">Higashiyama</a> dono no gyomotsu' (東山殿之御物), and '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Higashiyama (Kyoto Prefecture).html">Higashiyama</a> dono goshoji' (東山殿御所持) were used, and the four-character name '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Higashiyama (Kyoto Prefecture).html">Higashiyama</a> gyomotsu' (東山御物) came into being during the early <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period. According to a theory, the name '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Higashiyama (Kyoto Prefecture).html">Higashiyama</a> gyomotsu' became familiar largely due to "Sado <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Zenshu.html">Zenshu</a>" (complete collection of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Japanese tea.html">Japanese tea</a> ceremony) published by Sogensha (in 1936). </p>
<p>As the successive shoguns including <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshimitsu ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshimitsu ASHIKAGA</a> (Yoshimasa's grandfather) and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshinori ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshinori ASHIKAGA</a> (Yoshimasa's father) had a strong taste for <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Karamono.html">Karamono</a> (things imported from China), they collected Chinese paintings (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Karamono.html">Karamono</a>) of Sung (dynasty), Yuan (dynasty), etc., through trade between Japan and the Ming Dynasty, and the paintings were affixed with the seal of Kanzo in (a collector's seal, which was impressed on Sung and Yuan period paintings) such as 'Tenzan' and 'Doyu'<br/>
During the period of reign of Yoshimasa, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Noami.html">Noami</a>, the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Doboshu.html">doboshu</a> (the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>'s attendants in charge of entertainment), who was responsible for the maintenance and appraisal of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Karamono.html">Karamono</a>, compiled 'Gomotsu One <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Mokuroku.html">Mokuroku</a>' (an inventory of selected Chinese paintings in the Ashikaga collection) (280 sets, owned by Tokyo National Museum), sorting the works by materials and styles, and recording the names of the painters, the subjects of the paintings and sanja (person who appreciates the work and writes appraisal in it). <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Noami.html">Noami</a> also wrote "Kumidaikansochoki' (book of secrets about zashiki-kazari or decorations of a room or study with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Shoin (the Tendai sect).html">shoin</a> - one of Japan's most important residential architectural styles, established during the Momoyama era). </p>
<p>However, quite a few works were moved to various provinces or gone missing, because they were scattered and ultimately lost during the Onin-Bunmei Wars, given away to territorial lords, or sold to doso (pawnbrokers and moneylenders) due to the economic difficulties of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>. In the early Azuchi-Momoyama period, a trend to revere Yoshimasa as the 'founder of tea ceremony' started among the masters of tea ceremony, and the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Chaki (tea utensils).html">chaki</a> of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Higashiyama (Kyoto Prefecture).html">Higashiyama</a> gyomotsu came to be valued. Many of the existing <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Higashiyama (Kyoto Prefecture).html">Higashiyama</a> gyomotsu are designated as national treasures or important cultural properties. </p>
