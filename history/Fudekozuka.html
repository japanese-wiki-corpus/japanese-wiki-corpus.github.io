<h1>Fudekozuka (筆子塚)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Fudekozuka is a mound or a memorial tower built by the students of terakoya (private elementary school) or kajuku (private school) which were educational institution for common people in the Edo period, to the memory of their late teacher who taught them reading, writing, arithmetic and other practical arts. 
<br/>The cost of Fudekozuka was shared by the students<br/>
There are some instances built in Meiji Period. It also referred as shisho-zuka, fudeko-to or fudeko-hi. </p>
<p>Children were enrolled in terakoya at around their age of 7 or 8, as what elementary school is today, and learned reading and arithmetic for 3 to 5 years. These students were called "fudeko." Due to this origin, the term was often used as a name for girls. </p>
<p>Since many common people in the Edo Period studied at terakoya for the preparation of being a member of society, teacher of terakoya was regarded as their masters of life. As the name "terakoya (a room of temple)" suggests, many teachers were Buddhist priests. </p>
<p>In the Kanto region, there are many fudekozuka found in various places. A unique feature of monuments is that tombstones are commonly shaped like the tip of a brush. There seems some consensus to rule the shape of tombstone to be built by fudeko. The tombstones of successive principals of Ashikaga school, known as the "university of the Bando (old Kanto region)," are also shaped like brush tips. </p>
<p>Fudezuka<br/>
There exists mounds called fudezuka. 
<br/>Fudezuka is a mound in which brushes that have been used for many years were buried as an expression of gratitude<br/>
