<h1>Konida (小荷駄)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Konida refers to dachin umakasegi (a job of carrying by daba, packhorse or cow) or vehicles that carry army provisions, ammunition, set-up tools for encampment and so on needed for wars from the medieval period to modern times in Japan, or a troop that directed the above things, also referred to as konidatai. It corresponds to a troop that transports military goods in modern age. </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>Principally, laborers (servicemen) guarded by fifty to a hundred <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ashigaru.html">ashigaru</a> (common foot soldiers) who are all directed by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Hyoro (army provisions).html">hyoro</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Bugyo.html">bugyo</a> (food supply administrator) carried goods on packhorses or vehicles. Konida was positioned in the back of the troop during advance and in the front during retreat. </p>
<p>In the medieval period, soldiers were basically supposed to carry <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Hyoro (army provisions).html">hyoro</a> by themselves, but at the front, they took along only a few days worth of it and got konida to carry the rest, because the term was unpredictable and the heavy stuff could prevent their military action. In principle, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a> (provincial constable) had a right to press packhorses and servicemen used for konida, and so did warring lords, but actually it was konidabugyo (the commissioner of rear-echelon support troops) who was the decision maker. </p>
<p>In modern times, accepting konida's impressment was considered the obligation of the people of the domain, and impressment was conducted according to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kokudaka (The Figure Of Land Productivity).html">kokudaka</a> (yield) in each village. Because of this, soldiers were released from the obligation of taking along <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Hyoro (army provisions).html">hyoro</a>. </p>
