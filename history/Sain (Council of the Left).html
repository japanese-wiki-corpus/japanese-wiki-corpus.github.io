<h1>Sain (Council of the Left) (左院)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The Sain was a legislative and consultative body in the early <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period. It was established by the Daijokan (Grand Council of State) alongside the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Seiin (the Central State Council in the early Meiji period).html">Seiin</a> (Central State Council) and the Uin (Council of the Right) in 1871. It was abolished when the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Genroin (the Chamber of Elders).html">Genroin</a> (Senate of Japan) was established in 1875. </p>
<p>It consisted of a chairman, councillors with the ranks of the first to the third, and secretaries. The <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Seiin (the Central State Council in the early Meiji period).html">Seiin</a> controlled the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Appointment (Ninkan).html">appointment</a> or dismissal of the councillors. The resolutions adopted by the Sain did not constrain the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Seiin (the Central State Council in the early Meiji period).html">Seiin</a>. The Sain's power was limited. </p>
<p>In April 1872 it submitted 'Rikkoku-Kengi' to propose a plan for establishing a national constitution. 
<br/>In May of the same year it submitted 'a plan for establishing a lower house of parliament.'<br/>
This presented an idea of parliamentary government. 
<br/>The Sain is also known for having drafted 'regulations for the members of parliament,' which was a set of rules for the lower house of parliament.'<br/>
