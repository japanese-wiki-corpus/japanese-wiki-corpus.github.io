<h1>Kanei Mohan Kojou (Government-run model factories) (官営模範工場)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Government-run model factories were set up by the Meiji Government for the promotion of new industries. </p>
<p>After Meiji Restoration, the government took over bakufu's (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun) and feudal clans' businesses such as dockyards and mines, and Kobusho (the Ministry of Industry) and other institutes established government-run factories to modernize Japan and make the transition to capitalism. </p>
<p>Due to financial difficulties after the Seinan War, most factories were sold to private hands after 'General rules for selling government-run factories' came into force in 1880. These factories promoted the formation of Zaibatsu (company syndicate) and became the core of the Japanese Industries. </p>
