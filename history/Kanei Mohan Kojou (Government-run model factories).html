<h1>Kanei Mohan Kojou (Government-run model factories) (官営模範工場)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Government-run model factories were set up by the Meiji Government for the promotion of new industries. </p>
<p>After <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Meiji Restoration (Meiji-ishin).html">Meiji Restoration</a>, the government took over <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>'s (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>) and feudal clans' businesses such as dockyards and mines, and Kobusho (the Ministry of Industry) and other institutes established government-run factories to modernize Japan and make the transition to capitalism. </p>
<p>Due to financial difficulties after the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Seinan War (rebellion of samurai descendants).html">Seinan War</a>, most factories were sold to private hands after 'General rules for selling government-run factories' came into force in 1880. These factories promoted the formation of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Zaibatsu (a financial clique or group, or a company syndicate).html">Zaibatsu</a> (company syndicate) and became the core of the Japanese Industries. </p>
