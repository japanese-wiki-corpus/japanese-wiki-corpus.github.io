<p>Hatamoto-yoriaiseki was kakaku (family status) of high-ranking <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Hatamoto (direct retainers of shogun).html">hatamoto</a> with income of 3,000 koku or greater without official <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Appointment (Ninkan).html">appointment</a>, or retirees (known as yakuyoriai) who possessed social standing higher than hoi (those with the rank who wore clothes that did not bear family crests) in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Edo bakufu.html">Edo bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>). Its correct name was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yoriai.html">Yoriai</a>. Other social standings of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Hatamoto (direct retainers of shogun).html">hatamoto</a> include Koke (a master of ceremony; honorable family) and Kobushin-gumi (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> without official appointments who receive small salaries). It was under the control of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Wakadoshiyori.html">Wakadoshiyori</a> (junior councilor). <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kotaiyoriai.html">Kotaiyoriai</a> (alternate <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yoriai.html">yoriai</a>, a family status of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> warriors in the Edo period) was included in hatamoto-yoriaiseki, and although yoriai-oyakukin (a kind of tax) had to be paid, they were under the control of roju (senior councilor). In the last days of the Tokugawa shogunate, there were 180 hatamoto-yoriaiseki including <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kotaiyoriai.html">kotaiyoriai</a>. </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yoriai.html">Yoriai</a> had been under the control of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Rusui (a governmental post placed in the Edo bakufu and in domains).html">rusui</a> (caretaker or keeper [official post in the Edo period]; <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Rusui (a governmental post placed in the Edo bakufu and in domains).html">rusui</a> is under the control of rojyu [senior councilor of the Tokugawa shogunate]), but it became under the control of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Wakadoshiyori.html">wakadoshiyori</a> in June 1719, and in 1740, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Hatamoto (direct retainers of shogun).html">hatamoto</a> with income of 3,000 koku or greater was appointed as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yoriai.html">yoriai</a>. </p>
<p>The standards for <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yoriai.html">yoriai</a> were as follows:<br/>
</p>
<p>Karoku (hereditary stipend) of 3,000 koku or greater<br/>
</p>
<p>Even if the karoku was 3,000 koku or less, the following generation of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Rusui (a governmental post placed in the Edo bakufu and in domains).html">rusui</a> (caretaker or keeper [official post in the Edo era]), oban (obangumi unit [castle guards of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Hatamoto (direct retainers of shogun).html">hatamoto</a>]), shoinban (the castle guards) and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Koshogumi (page corps).html">koshogumi</a> (page corps) were considered as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yoriai.html">yoriai</a>. </p>
<p><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kotaiyoriai.html">Kotaiyoriai</a> was included in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yoriai.html">yoriai</a>, even if the karoku was 3,000 koku or less. </p>
<p>Retirees who had served a post of 3,000 koku or less with a rank higher than hoi were included in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yoriai.html">yoriai</a> as yakuyoriai. </p>
<p>As an exception, former daimyos (Japanese territorial lord), Kanamori clan and Honda clan (the lineage of Tadanaka HONDA), were included in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yoriai.html">yoriai</a>. </p>
<p>However, even with the karoku of 3,000 koku or greater, those who belonged to omote-koke (a post in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Edo bakufu.html">Edo bakufu</a> that was in charge of its rituals and so on that had no official court rank) were not included in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yoriai.html">yoriai</a>. </p>
<p>Yoriai-kimoiri without official <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Appointment (Ninkan).html">appointment</a> was selected from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yoriai.html">yoriai</a> in 1790, and they recommended and made intercessions in appointing posts and assigning additional posts from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yoriai.html">yoriai</a>. Yoriai-oyakukin, which was equivalent to kobushinkin (a kind of tax), was paid by installments in August and February at the rate of 2 ryo per 100 koku. </p>
