<h1>Daimon (大紋)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Daimon is a type of Japanese kimono for males. </p>
<p>Around the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period, it became fashionable to put large patterns on <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Hitatare.html">Hitatare</a> (a kind of court dress in old days). In the Muromachi period, that sort of kimono was called Daimon to be distinguished from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Hitatare.html">Hitatare</a>. In the late Muromachi period, Daimon was made of linen with its pattern on a fixed position and was considered as the second formal wear, following <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Hitatare.html">Hitatare</a>. </p>
<p>In the Edo period, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Edo bakufu.html">Edo bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>) defined Daimon as 'a formal wear for <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> families with Buke-kani (official court titles for <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a>) or higher titles.'<br/>
In those days, ordinary daimyos were customarily appointed to the Fifth Rank, so Daimon became a formal wear for daimyos. Both the upper and lower parts of Daimon at that time were made from the same material, and the lower part, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Hakama (pleated and divided skirt made in fine strips).html">hakama</a>, was so long that the wearers had to drag it. There was a big difference between Daimon and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Hitatare.html">Hitatare</a> or Suo: family crests were dyed out at ten parts of Daimon, including larger family crests at the back, right and left front sides, back side of each sleeve, and the backside of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Hakama (pleated and divided skirt made in fine strips).html">hakama</a> and smaller crests at two places on the front part of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Hakama (pleated and divided skirt made in fine strips).html">hakama</a>. </p>
<p>At present, we can see Yasuie TOGASHI wearing Daimon in '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kanjincho.html">Kanjincho</a>' (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kabuki.html">Kabuki</a> (traditional performing art)) and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Naganori ASANO.html">Naganori ASANO</a> wearing one during the scene of 'matsu no roka' (literally, a corridor of pine trees) in 'Chushingura' (period drama). Thus, Daimon is now used only for stage garments. </p>
