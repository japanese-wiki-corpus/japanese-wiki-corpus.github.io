<h1>Great Fire of Jisho (治承の大火)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The Great Fire of Jisho happened within the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Heian-kyo.html">Heian-kyo</a> on May 9, 1179. It is also called the 'Jiro <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shobo.html">shobo</a>'. </p>
<p>The fire started during the night from Shichijo Higashinotoin and spread by the east wind that was blowing at that time and reached <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/road/Suzaku-oji Street.html">Suzaku-oji Street</a>, burning about thirty something cho. The fire directly hit the area that was heavily populated at the time. It was the same area that was burned during the Taro <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shobo.html">shobo</a> in the previous year and this shocked the people. </p>
<p>The date of this fire is mentioned as May 9 (lunar calendar) in the "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Gyokuyo.html">Gyokuyo</a>" (Diary of FUJIWARA no Kanezane) and June 8 (lunar calendar) in "Goseirokuki" and there is a theory that proposes the date in "Goseirokuki" as correct. </p>
