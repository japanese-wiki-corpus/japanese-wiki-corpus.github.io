<p></p>
<p>The Battle of Kyoko-ji Temple was fought between <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Nagayoshi MIYOSHI.html">Nagayoshi MIYOSHI</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Takamasa HATAKEYAMA.html">Takamasa HATAKEYAMA</a> near Kyoko-ji Mura, Takayasu County, Kawachi Province (present-day Kyoko-ji, Yao City, Osaka Prefecture) on May 19 and 20, 1562. It is also referred to as Kyoko-ji Kassen. It was the biggest battle fought during Sengoku period (period of warring states) in Kinai region. </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>It was the last battle of the series of battles fought between the Miyoshi's government and the Kawachi Hatakeyama clan, both seeking for supremacy in Kinai region. The Miyoshi's government was an emergent power which brought down the Hosokawa's <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kanrei.html">Kanrei</a> (top ranked job in Muromachi era to support <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> and control the government) system by a revolt. The Kawachi Hatakeyama clan was an old power, one of Sankanrei (three families in the post of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kanrei.html">Kanrei</a>) and relatives to the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/family/Hosokawa clan.html">Hosokawa clan</a>, but had been opposed to the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/family/Hosokawa clan.html">Hosokawa clan</a> for long. The battle was led by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Nagayoshi MIYOSHI.html">Nagayoshi MIYOSHI</a>, a resourceful general of the emerging power, and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Takamasa HATAKEYAMA.html">Takamasa HATAKEYAMA</a>, a brave general of the old power. It was a big battle in which all the brigades were mobilized, and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Nagayoshi MIYOSHI.html">Nagayoshi MIYOSHI</a> successfully got rid of the opposing old powers in Kinai region by winning this battle. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Nagayoshi MIYOSHI.html">Nagayoshi MIYOSHI</a> became Tenkabito (person becoming the ruler of the country), taking control of Kawachi Province and Izumi Province, while becoming influential in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Yamato Province.html">Yamato Province</a> and Kii Province. However he lost Masanari MIYOSHI and Yoshikata MIYOSHI, who were both influential among his family, in this battle, so the Miyoshi's government had difficulties lying ahead.. <h3>The Situation Before the Battle</h3>
</p>
<p>The Hatakeyama clan had reigned as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a> (provincial military governor) of Kawachi Province since the early Muromachi Period. The Hatakeyama clan had been frequently oppressed by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Nagayoshi MIYOSHI.html">Nagayoshi MIYOSHI</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a> of the neighboring Settsu Province as well as Awa Province, Awaji Province and Sanuki Province. </p>
<p>Takamasa Hatakeyama, the family head of the Hatakeyama clan, was a brave general, but the Hatakeyama family itself was disrupted by the Sengoku mood shift, so controlling the vassals was difficult. Consequently, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Nagayoshi MIYOSHI.html">Nagayoshi MIYOSHI</a>, the warring lord of the neighboring province, often interfered in Hatakeyama's domestic affairs. Miyoshi Nagayoshi even affected the choice of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugodai.html">shugodai</a> (deputy military governor) which was the head of the vassals. </p>
<p>On May 5, 1551, Naganori YUSA, who was resourceful <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugodai.html">shugodai</a> considered as an actual landed <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> of Kawachi, was assassinated. Then Kawachi Province fell into disorder, but in 1552, a relative to Naganori YUSA, Munefusa (Naomasa) YASUMI who was the adopted son of a powerful local lord in Katano City, Kawachi Province, the Yasumi clan, killed the assassinators including Katatsugu KAYAFURI and gained power. Munefusa YASUMI became <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugodai.html">shugodai</a> (the acting Military Governor), but Munefusa YASUMI and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Takamasa HATAKEYAMA.html">Takamasa HATAKEYAMA</a> began to clash. In 1559, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Takamasa HATAKEYAMA.html">Takamasa HATAKEYAMA</a> asked for <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Nagayoshi MIYOSHI.html">Nagayoshi MIYOSHI</a>'s support to compete with Munefusa YASUMI who had support from powerful local lords. </p>
<p>On this occasion, Munefusa YASUMI's Imoriyama Castle was attacked by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Nagayoshi MIYOSHI.html">Nagayoshi MIYOSHI</a>, and the castle became <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Nagayoshi MIYOSHI.html">Nagayoshi MIYOSHI</a>'s. In 1560, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Takamasa HATAKEYAMA.html">Takamasa HATAKEYAMA</a> and Munefusa YASUMI were reconciled, but it gave <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Nagayoshi MIYOSHI.html">Nagayoshi MIYOSHI</a> an excuse to attack the Hatakeyama clan. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Takamasa HATAKEYAMA.html">Takamasa HATAKEYAMA</a> started to exercise improved discipline among <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kokujin.html">kokujin</a> ryoshu (local <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> lords), and united powerful warlords such as Munefusa YASUMI and Naomitsu YUKAWA to compete with <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Nagayoshi MIYOSHI.html">Nagayoshi MIYOSHI</a>. </p>
<p>In 1562, Yoshikata (Shotei) ROKKAKU proposed a military alliance to launch a pincer attack on <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Nagayoshi MIYOSHI.html">Nagayoshi MIYOSHI</a>. There was a hidden motive by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshiteru ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshiteru ASHIKAGA</a> to restore the authority of the Muromachi <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>. It can be said that the Rokkaku clan and the Hatakeyama clan, both old powers, started to fight back against the emerging Miyoshi clan. <h3>The military strength</h3>
</p>
<p>Unlike the battle of Kumeda, Miyoshi's army which recovered from its off-balanced position, had an advantage. When Hatakeyama's army attacked Imoriyama Castle where <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Nagayoshi MIYOSHI.html">Nagayoshi MIYOSHI</a> lived, Hatakeyama's military strength overwhelmed Miyoshi's. Yoshitoki MIYOSHI, however, mobilized local lords in Settsu and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Tanba Province.html">Tanba Province</a>, issuing a manifesto. As a result, Miyoshi's side rectified its numerical inferiority, and when Hatakeyama and Miyoshi confronted at Kyoko-ji Temple, Miyoshi's side had the upper hand. Hatakeyama, however, had <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Saikashu (Saika group).html">Saikashu</a> and Negoroshu (group of armed people and armed priests in Negoro-ji Temple) with 4000 matchlock guns, which was a menace to Miyoshi. </p>
<p>The chain of command<br/>
Regarding the chain of command, Miyoshi made family members commanders of each unit (made of local clan), so the orders by the supreme commander <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Nagayoshi MIYOSHI.html">Nagayoshi MIYOSHI</a> were delivered well. Compared to Miyoshi's, Hatakeyama's chain of command was not unified, as various leaders of local clans and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> lords joined the force independently. In the course of the battle, Miyoshi obviously topped first and Hatakeyama had to keep pace. It is considered that Miyoshi, with an unified chain of command, gained the initiative and Hatakeyama, with a disordered chain of command, had to be one step behind. </p>

</p>
<p>There are historical materials saying that they had periodic showers which started in the night of May 18.

</p>

Knowing the defeat of the Hatakeyama clan, the Rokkaku clan receded to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Omi Province.html">Omi Province</a> and tried to make peace with Miyoshi. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/family/The Miyoshi clan.html">The Miyoshi clan</a> became more powerful because an old power, the Hatakeyama clan collapsed and the Rokkaku clan also gave in.
