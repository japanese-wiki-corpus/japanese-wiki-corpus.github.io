<h1>Hakuho culture (白鳳文化)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Hakuho culture is a magnanimous culture which flourished between the Taika Reforms in 645 and the relocation of Heijo-kyo capital in 710, falling between the Asuka culture represented by the architecture and Buddha statues of Horyu-ji Temple and the Tenpyo culture represented by Buddha statues of Todai-ji Temple and buildings of Toshodai-ji Temple. 
<br/>In addition, Hakuho is one of the era names which do not appear in Chronicles of Japan (called 'Itsugango' or 'Shinengo') (However, Hakuo appears in Shoku Nihongi.)<br/>
The era name of Hakuo is thought to have been used around the time of the Emperor Tenmu (another theory is around the time of the Emperor Tenchi), when the Hakuho culture was also at its best. </p>
<p>Characteristics<br/>
Completed around the end of seventh century and being the largest-scaled among the ancient cities, it was a gorgeous, imperial and aristocratic culture around the Fujiwara Capital, which featured genuine Chinese style capital with street plan. </p>
<p>It was also the time when the Asuka Kiyomihara Code and the Taiho Code were established, and the genuine nation began. It was affected by the culture of early Tang, the Korean Peninsula, India and West and Central Asia. </p>
<p>The culture flourished most at the time of the Emperor Tenmu and the Emperor Jito, but included some of the time of their predecessors, the Emperor Tenchi and the Emperor Kobun. </p>
<p>Establishment of the Ritsuryo codes<br/>
The genuine nation launched adopting highly-civilized system from mainland China. </p>
<p>The Asuka Kiyomihara Code<br/>
Taiho Code was completed in 701 and enforced immediately.. </p>
