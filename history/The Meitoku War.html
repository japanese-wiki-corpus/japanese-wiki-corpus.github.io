<p></p>
<p>The Meitoku War was a war against the Muromachi <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>) that was started by the Yamana clan members, such as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Ujikiyo YAMANA.html">Ujikiyo YAMANA</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Mitsuyuki YAMANA.html">Mitsuyuki YAMANA</a>, in 1391 during the Muromachi period. It is also called the Battle in the Greater Imperial Palace. </p>
<p>One Feudal Lord for One Sixth<br/>
</p>
<p>The Yamana clan was a member of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/family/Nitta clan.html">Nitta clan</a>. However, during <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Tokiuji YAMANA.html">Tokiuji YAMANA</a>'s era, the clan sided with <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Takauji ASHIKAGA.html">Takauji ASHIKAGA</a>, who raised an army against the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>. Later, the clan allied itself again with the Ashikaga clan and made achievements during the period of the Northern and Southern Courts (Japan). The clan aided <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Tadayoshi ASHIKAGA.html">Tadayoshi ASHIKAGA</a> and fought in the Kanno Disturbance. After Tadayoshi's death the clan returned to serving the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>. However, the clan revolted again, descended to the Southern Court (Japan), and at one <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Point (Sentoki).html">point</a>, it occupied the city of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, demonstrating its might. Later, the clan fought, aiding <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Tadafuyu ASHIKAGA.html">Tadafuyu ASHIKAGA</a>, and laid down large forces in the Sanin area. The clan submitted to the Muromachi <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> during the era of the second seii taishogun (literally, "great general who subdues the barbarians") <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshiakira ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshiakira ASHIKAGA</a>, with a condition that the clan was guaranteed territory which had been taken away. Tokiuji became a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a> (provincial military governor) of the five provinces of Inaba, Hoki, Tamba, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Tango (the Boys Festival).html">Tango</a> and Mimasaka. </p>
<p>Even after the death of Tokiuji the Yamana clan expanded its territory. Moroyoshi YAMANA, the eldest son who succeeded as the heir, the second son Yoshimasa YAMANA, the third son, Ujifuyu YAMANA, the fourth son, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Ujikiyo YAMANA.html">Ujikiyo YAMANA</a> and the fifth son, Tokiyoshi YAMANA, respectively became <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a> of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Tango (the Boys Festival).html">Tango</a> and Hoki Provinces, Kii Province, Inaba Province, Tamba, Yamashiro and Izumi Provinces, and Mimasaka, Tajima and Bingo Provinces. In addition, Moroyoshi's son, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Mitsuyuki YAMANA.html">Mitsuyuki YAMANA</a>, newly gained a position as a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a> of Harima Province. 
<br/>Of 66 provinces nationwide, the Yamana clan members became <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a> of 11 provinces, and the clan was called 'one feudal lord of one sixth.'<br/>
</p>
<p>Strengthening of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>'s authority<br/>
The Muromachi <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>'s <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> was positioned atop an alliance of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> (Japanese territorial lords), and his authority was weak. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshimitsu ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshimitsu ASHIKAGA</a>, who became the third <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> in 1369, tried to strengthen the authority of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>. </p>
<p>In 1379, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kanrei.html">kanrei</a> (shogunal deputy) <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoriyuki HOSOKAWA.html">Yoriyuki HOSOKAWA</a>, who had the actual power in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>, fell from power due to the Koryaku Coup. Yoshimitsu seized power by using the opposition between the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/family/Hosokawa clan.html">Hosokawa clan</a> and the Shiba clan. He steadily strengthened the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>'s authority by reinforcing the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Hokoshu.html">hokoshu</a> (guard force under <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>'s direct control), which was under his direct control. </p>
<p>In addition to this, Yoshimitsu tried to weaken the powerful <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> that were hard to bring under control because they had become too powerful. In 1387, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoriyasu TOKI.html">Yoriyasu TOKI</a>, a meritorious vassal who helped to establish the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>, and who was a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a> of the three provinces of Mino, Owari and Ise, passed away. Yasuyuki TOKI succeeded, but Yoshimitsu manipulated it so that the Toki clan members would split. He provoked Yasuyuki so that he had to raise an army. Yoshimitsu gave an order to subjugate Yasuyuki in 1389, and in the following year, 1390, his order was executed (Yasuyuki TOKI's Rebellion). </p>
<p>Yoshimitsu's next target was the Yamana clan that ruled 11 provinces. </p>
<p>The internal feud of the Yamana clan<br/>
The heir of the Yamana clan, Moroyoshi, passed away in 1376. Because his sons, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshiyuki YAMANA.html">Yoshiyuki YAMANA</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Ujiyuki YAMANA.html">Ujiyuki YAMANA</a>, Yoshiaki YAMANA and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Mitsuyuki YAMANA.html">Mitsuyuki YAMANA</a> were young, his younger brother, Tokiyoshi, became the interim heir. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Ujikiyo YAMANA.html">Ujikiyo YAMANA</a> and his son-in-law, Mitsuyuki, showed disapproval regarding this. </p>
<p>In 1389, Tokiyoshi, the heir, Tokiyoshi, passed away. In 1390, Yoshimitsu complained that Tokiyoshi was disrespectful to the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> when he was alive. He further complained that <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Tokihiro YAMANA.html">Tokihiro YAMANA</a>, who had succeeded him, and the younger brother <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Ujiyuki YAMANA.html">Ujiyuki YAMANA</a> had also shown noticeably disrespectful behavior. Therefore, Yoshimitsu ordered Ujikiyo and Mitsuyuki to subjugate them. </p>
<p>Tokihiro and Ujiyuki raised their armies and fought. However, Ujikiyo attacked Tokihiro's base of Tajima, and Mitsuyuki attached Ujiyuki's base of Hoki. In the following year, in 1391, Tokihiro and Ujiyuki were defeated and they faced a downfall. </p>
<p>As a reward for their achievements in the war, Ujikiyo was given the position of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a> of Tajima and Yamashiro Provinces, and Mitsuyuki was given the position of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a> of Hoki and Oki Provinces. </p>
<p>Yoshimitsu's provocations<br/>
Yoshimitsu broke up the Yamana clan and ousted Tokihiro and Ujiyuki, but Ujikiyo and Mitsuyuki's powers increased. Yoshimitsu then began to execute ingenious provocations against Ujikiyo and Mitsuyuki. </p>
<p>In 1391, Tokihiro and Ujiyuki, who were on the run, returned to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. They were hiding in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Kiyomizu-dera Temple.html">Kiyomizu-dera Temple</a> area, and they begged Yoshimitsu for a pardon. A rumor spread that Yoshimitsu was going to grant this pardon. Ujikiyo became uneasy. He had invited Yoshimitsu to a fall foliage viewing in the city of Uji in November of the same year, but he fell into disgrace with Yoshimitsu when he canceled it at the last minute, using illness as an excuse. </p>
<p>In December of the same year, Mitsuyuki was stripped of his position as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a> of Izumo Province and he was banished from <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. The reasons were that he seized <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Sento.html">sento</a> ryo Yokota no sho, which was <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Goenyu.html">Emperor Goenyu</a>'s Imperial property within Mitsuyuki's territory of Izumo Province, and that he did not follow the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Migyosho.html">migyosho</a> (document of shogunate order). Angered, Mitsuyuki went to the city of Sakai in Izumi Province, which was a territory of Ujikiyo, his father-in-law. 
<br/>He encouraged him to raise an army because the '<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>'s behavior these days indicate that he intends to destroy the Yamana clan.'<br/>
Ujikiyo agreed to this, and he decided to attack <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> in one sweep. He let Mitsuyuki return to his territory of Tamba so that he could prepare to attack <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> through Tambaji (Tamba Road). As Ujikiyo gathered his army in Sakai, he visited Yoshimasa, who was a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a> of Kii, and he encouraged him to raise an army. Yoshimasa hesitated, but he finally agreed. Ujikiyo descended to the Southern Court in order to obtain a legitimate reason, and he was granted the Imperial standard made of a gold brocade. </p>
<p>The news of Ujikiyo and Mitsuyuki's insurrection was passed on to the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> on January 21, 1392 through the local governors of Tamba and Kawachi Provinces. The senior vassals of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> were dubious of the news. However, Rakuchu (inside the capital city of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>) was in chaos as Ujikiyo's nephew, Ujiie YAMANA (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a> of Inaba Province) left <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> in order to join his clan, and the senior vassals became aware of the Yamana clan's rebellion. </p>
<p>On January 27, 1392, Yoshimitsu held a war council, and there were discussions of reconciliation among the senior vassals. Yoshimitsu had provoked Ujikiyo and Mitsuyuki to raise an army, but he was not confident that he would win. The Yamana clan's forces were very powerful, and during the period of Tokiuji, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> had been captured twice by the Yamana clan armies. 
<br/>Yoshimitsu avoided the peace treaty, and he decided to fight by saying, 'I leave up to the view of the heavens the destinies of my clan and the Yamana clan.'<br/>
</p>
<p>Battle in the Greater Imperial Palace<br/>
</p>
<p>In order to fight against the Yamana army invading into <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> army positioned the principal force of 5000 cavalrymen in Uchino, which was the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Daidairi.html">daidairi</a> (place of Imperial residence and government offices) of the former <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Heian-kyo.html">Heian-kyo</a> (ancient capital). Yoshimitsu and 5000 cavalrymen of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Umamawari (horse guards).html">umamawari</a> (horse guards) (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Hokoshu.html">hokoshu</a>) (a military post in Muromachi shogunate) waited at the Isshiki family residence at Horikawa. </p>
<p>The Yamana army had set the date of the decisive battle on January 29, 1392. 3000 cavalrymen of Ujikiyo's army advanced from Sakai, and 2000 cavalrymen of Mitsuyuki advanced from Tamba to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. Departing from Uchino, Mitsuyuki's army advancing on Tambaji reached Mune no do (a temple or a shrine where <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Seiwa.html">Emperor Seiwa</a> is enshrined) in Misato by January 28, 1392, and they lined up themselves. Ujikiyo's arrival was delayed because of an interruption by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugodai.html">shugodai</a> (acting military governor) of Kawachi Province, Kuninaga YUSA. Some men from his army began to drop out and surrender to the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>. </p>
<p>On the night of January 31, 1392, Ujikiyo's army, arriving late, reached Nakajima in Yodo, and they separated into three squads and marched into <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. Mitsuyuki's army split into two groups and attacked <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. Because the army advanced in the moonless night the squads were uncoordinated, and they ended up entering <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> separately. </p>
<p>Early in the morning of February 1, 1392, 700 cavalrymen of Yoshikazu YAMANA and Yoshishige KOBAYASHI attacked Nijo <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Omiya (The Tale of Genji).html">Omiya</a>. They collided with 300 cavalrymen of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshihiro OUCHI.html">Yoshihiro OUCHI</a>, and the battle began. The Ouchi forces got off their horses and shot arrows like rain. The battle became chaotic, and Yoshikazu YAMANA and Kozukenosuke KOBAYASHI, who were losing ground, charged ahead, with an intention to die in the battle. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshihiro OUCHI.html">Yoshihiro OUCHI</a> prevailed even though he was injured while fighting against Kozukenosuke KOBAYASHI. Yoshikazu YAMANA also died in the battle and the Yamana forces lost at the beginning of the battle. Yoshimitsu awarded a sword to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshihiro OUCHI.html">Yoshihiro OUCHI</a> in praise of his heroic deed. </p>
<p>Next, 2000 cavalrymen of Mitsuyuki attacked Uchino. The <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> army on the defense consisted of 3000 cavalrymen of Hosokawa, Hatakeyama and Kyogoku clans, and the battle became fierce. However, 5000 cavalrymen of Yoshimitsu's <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Umamawari (horse guards).html">umamawari</a> were added and the battle became decisive. Mitsuyuki, who was defeated, fled to Tamba. </p>
<p>2000 cavalrymen of Ujikiyo's forces split into two groups and charged ahead. They collided with the forces of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshihiro OUCHI.html">Yoshihiro OUCHI</a> and Yoshinori AKAMATSU. Ujikiyo fought hard and held off Ouchi and Akamatsu's forces. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Tokihiro YAMANA.html">Tokihiro YAMANA</a>, who had been serving the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>, entered the battle with 50 cavalrymen. He fought until there were only eight cavalrymen left. Ouchi and Akamatsu, losing ground, requested Yoshimitsu for a support army. The forces of the Isshiki clan and the Shiba clan joined, and the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> army reversed the tide. Ujikiyo's forces were prepared to flee, and they had a debacle as Yoshimitsu himself entered the battle on horseback with <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Umamawari (horse guards).html">umamawari</a>. Ujikiyo tried to flee, but he was surrounded by the Isshiki forces and he was killed by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Akinori ISSHIKI.html">Akinori ISSHIKI</a>. </p>
<p>Thus, the Yamana clan was defeated in one day of battle. There were 260 deaths from the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> army and there were 879 deaths from the Yamana army. </p>
