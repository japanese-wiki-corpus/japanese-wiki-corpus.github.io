<h1>Taishin (大身)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Taishin (person of high rank and income) refers to a person who has a high rank and a high stipend. It refers to a person from a high-ranked wealthy family. </p>
<p>From the Muromachi period to the Sengoku period (Japan), among Kokujin Ryoshu (local samurai lords), a feudal lord who was descended from a clan in the Kamakura period, possessed more than several Gun and had the power equivalent to Daimyo (Japanese feudal lord), was called Taishin. For example, Chikugo 15 castles. </p>
<p>In the Edo period, Hatamoto Yoriaiseki (a family rank of high-ranking Hatamoto, direct vassal of the shogun) who had more than 3000 koku (a unit of volume: rice 1-koku is 180.39 liter, lumber 1-koku is 0.278 cubic meter) as well as Hatamoto (direct retainers of the bakufu, which is a form of Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun) who had more than 2000 koku and managed to do Kaminanori (announcing as a provincial vice-governor), were called 'Taishin Hatamoto' (greater vassal). </p>
<p>Even after the Meiji period, 'Taishin' remained as a word referring to a high government official, a head of Zaibatsu (a financial clique or group, or company syndicate), and the peerage until the time of World War II in the Showa period. </p>
