<h1><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">Samurai</a> daisho (侍大将)</h1>
<p></p>
<p><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">Samurai</a> daisho is a man who commands an army under Dai <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> (the great general). Or <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> taishogun. </p>
<p>The role of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> daisho was recognized since the Genpei War in the Heian period, and it is known that there was a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> daisho called Go ITO(伊藤五)in the Taira's army, and so on. Since the late Muromachi period, it came to take on the character to supervise <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> and command <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Sonae.html">sonae</a> (a troop) and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Cavalry.html">cavalry</a>, and in the Sengoku period (period of warring states) (Japan) it played a leading role in the military system of sengoku <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> (Japanese territorial lord in the Sengoku period), taking its position between a rank next to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Sodaisho (a commander in chief).html">sodaisho</a> (commander in chief) and a rank over <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ashigaru.html">ashigaru</a> taisho (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> in command of infantry). As a famous <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> daisho, there lived Harutaka SUE, who was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shugodai.html">Shugodai</a> (the acting Military Governor) of the Suo Province and a vassal of sengoku <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> of Saigoku (Western part of Japan) Yoshitaka Ouchi; SUE was refered to as the Samurai Daisho Unrivaled in Saigoku. </p>
