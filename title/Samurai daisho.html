<h1>Samurai daisho (侍大将)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Samurai daisho is a man who commands an army under Dai Shogun (the great general). Or samurai taishogun. </p>
<p>The role of the samurai daisho was recognized since the Genpei War in the Heian period, and it is known that there was a samurai daisho called Go ITO(伊藤五)in the Taira's army, and so on. Since the late Muromachi period, it came to take on the character to supervise samurai and command sonae (a troop) and cavalry, and in the Sengoku period (period of warring states) (Japan) it played a leading role in the military system of sengoku daimyo (Japanese territorial lord in the Sengoku period), taking its position between a rank next to sodaisho (commander in chief) and a rank over ashigaru taisho (samurai in command of infantry). As a famous samurai daisho, there lived Harutaka SUE, who was Shugodai (the acting Military Governor) of the Suo Province and a vassal of sengoku daimyo of Saigoku (Western part of Japan) Yoshitaka Ouchi; SUE was refered to as the Samurai Daisho Unrivaled in Saigoku. </p>
