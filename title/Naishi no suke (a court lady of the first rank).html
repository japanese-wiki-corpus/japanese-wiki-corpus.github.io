</div>

<p></p>
<p><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Naishi.html">Naishi</a> no suke was a government post in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Ritsuryo.html">ritsuryo</a> system (a system of centralized government based on the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Ritsuryo.html">ritsuryo</a> code) and an undersecretary (a court lady) of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Naishi no tsukasa.html">Naishi no tsukasa</a> (female palace attendants in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kokyu (empresss residence).html">kokyu</a> [empress's residence.])<br/>
</p>
<p>The director was <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Naishi no tsukasa.html">Naishi no tsukasa</a>, but later, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Naishi no tsukasa.html">Naishi no tsukasa</a> became the empress, so that no one was appointed to that position and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Naishi.html">Naishi</a> no suke practically served as the director. </p>
<p>In the kanisoto sei (the ranks of the bureaucracy system of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Ritsuryo.html">ritsuryo</a> system), <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Naishi.html">Naishi</a> no suke ranked at Jushiijo (Junior Fourth Rank) (or Jushiinoge [Junior Fourth Rank, Lower Grade]), but often promoted to the second or the third ranks. </p>
<p>It is also read as 'suke' or 'tenji.'<br/>
Many of them were called themselves by adding their family names or the government posts of their fathers before the post name, such as To no <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Naishi.html">Naishi</a> no suke, or Dainagon <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Naishi.html">Naishi</a> no suke (Secretary of major councilor). </p>
<p><h3><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Naishi.html">Naishi</a> no suke until the end of Edo period</h3>
</p>
<p><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Naishi.html">Naishi</a> no suke was the highest rank of the high-quality court ladies in the palace at the end of Edo period. 
<br/>The person who was placed in the most highest position among the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Naishi.html">Naishi</a> no suke and controlled the court ladies was called osuke, and controlled all of the various matters of Otsune Goten Palace in Gosho (imperial palace) along with the Koto <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Naishi.html">naishi</a> no jo (clerical worker at government offices, also called nagahashi no tsubone since lived in a corridor from <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Seiryoden.html">Seiryoden</a> to Shishinden.)<br/>
Some <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Naishi.html">Naishi</a> no suke served as the secretary in the daily life of the Emperor (vestal court ladies), others served as the concubines who receive the total favor of the Emperor and bear princes and princesses. (Almost all of the real mothers of the Emperors who were enthroned in the Edo period were <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Naishi.html">Naishi</a> no suke. 
<br/>In the Imperial Families of the recent period, the biological child of seishitsu (legal wife) became the heir in the first time ever in the generations of Empress Teimei and Empress Kojun.)<br/>
Therefore, only daughters of kuge (a court noble) having the certain family status could be <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Naishi.html">Naishi</a> no suke, and the daughters of higher ranked kuge among Urinke and Meike became <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Naishi.html">Naishi</a> no suke. </p>
<p>On the other hand, daughters of kuge having the most highest family status such as Sekke (line of regents and advisers), Seiga, and daijinke (the third highest status for court nobles) supposedly became the lawful wife, and were given the position upper than <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Nyogo (rank of court lady).html">nyogo</a> (Jusango), so that they were supposed not to be <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Naishi.html">Naishi</a> no suke. <h3><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Naishi.html">Naishi</a> no suke in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period and later</h3>
</p>
<p>The court ladies including <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Naishi.html">Naishi</a> no suke were occupied by daughters of kuge until the end of the Edo period and they had the immeasurable power in the court by serving close to the Emperor, however, drastic reform was executed by the new <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> government. 
<br/>Fist, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Naishi.html">Naishi</a> no suke Shizuko HIROHASHI and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Naishi.html">Naishi</a> no suke Fusako TAKANO, who had the biggest power in the imperial court as the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Naishi.html">Naishi</a> no suke of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Komei.html">Emperor Komei</a>, were dismissed from their positions because 'they overwhelmed the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kokyu (empresss residence).html">kokyu</a> (empress's residence) by their power and didn't frequently obey even the order of the empress.'<br/>
Next, all the court ladies under the rank of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Naishi.html">Naishi</a> no suke who were placed under the Emperor were integrated and moved under the empress, and daughters of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> families and the peerage could be adopted. </p>
<p>Further, the government posts of the Empress and court ladies were arranged, and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Naishi.html">Naishi</a> no Kami (Principal Handmaid) was again placed above <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Naishi.html">Naishi</a> no suke, however, it practically remained vacancy. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Naruko YANAGIHARA.html">Naruko YANAGIHARA</a>, the mother of Emperor Taisho was the last <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Naishi.html">Naishi</a> no suke who was the real mother of the Emperor in the imperial palace. Thereafter, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Naishi.html">Naishi</a> no suke played a role only as the court lady for clerical work in the modern age, however, its recruitment standard depended on the caste system until the end of Edo period. In 'Employment bylaw of Kyujo nyokan (court lady in the place where Emperor lives)' in the early Taisho period, it was described that when higher ranked court ladies such as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Naishi.html">Naishi</a> no suke and Gon no <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Naishi.html">naishi</a> no suke are adopted, 'they should be selected from daughters of former tosho, former lords among peerage', so they were selected from kuge and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">Daimyo</a> family (feudal lord family) before the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> restoration among the peerage (however, for the lower ranked court lady, woman who was not from the peerage was allowed to work in the palace only in her generation depending on her ability). The examples of such court ladies were Toshiko Kishida and Utako Shimada. The salary of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Naishi.html">Naishi</a> no suke was 250 yen (the first salary of a teacher of an elementary school at that time was 8 yen), and the salary of Gon no <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Naishi.html">naishi</a> no suke was 200 yen in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> era. <h3>Duty of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Naishi.html">Naishi</a> no suke</h3>
</p>
<p>In 'Document about acquaintanceship of Kyujo nyokan,' the duties of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Naishi.html">Naishi</a> no suke and Gon no <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Naishi.html">naishi</a> no suke until the Taisho era were specified. 
<br/>According to the document, the duties of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Naishi.html">Naishi</a> no suke and Gon no <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Naishi.html">naishi</a> no suke were:<br/>
</p>
<p>To stand by the Emperor and the Empress to control everything in front of them;<br/>
To take charge of the costume above the waist of the Emperor and the Empress, tray services, and bathing. </p>
<p>To supervise the court ladies;<br/>
To hold <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Kenji (Divine Sword and Jewel).html">Kenji</a> (the Sacred Sword and the Sacred Jewel) and hand them to the chokunin jiju (chamberlain appointed by the royal command) at the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Kenji (Divine Sword and Jewel).html">Kenji</a> togyo (ceremony for imperial succession);<br/>
To attend the pray in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shinden.html">shinden</a> (shrine sanctuary) such as kashikodokoro (a palace sanctuary) and Koreiden (a palace enshrines the sprits of ancestor) as the proxy for the Empress when she cannot attend;<br/>
To manage a grant and a gift;<br/>
To mediate the visit from the Imperial family to the Emperor and the Empress;<br/>
To manage the stored money;<br/>
And others. <h3>Abolition of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Naishi.html">Naishi</a> no suke</h3>
</p>
<p>Abolition of the post of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Naishi.html">Naishi</a> no suke was triggered by the establishment of the Togu-shiki (the Board of the Crown Prince's Affairs) court lady system in the end of Taisho era, and was determined by the reform of the court ladies led by crown prince at the time, Prince Hirohito (Emperor Showa). When Prince Hirohito became the emperor, the Togu-shiki court lady system changed over to Kogogushiki (the Queen-consort's Household Agency) court laday, and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Naishi.html">Naishi</a> no suke naturally disappeared, so that Otsubone system (court lady system), which continued from the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Ritsuryo.html">ritsuryo</a> system, was abolished. </p>
