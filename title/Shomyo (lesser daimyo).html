<h1>Shomyo (lesser <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a>) (小名)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Shomyo were <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> who were not well known. Shomyo paired up with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> (feudal lord). </p>
<p>Explanation<br/>
Shomyo means a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> family which was not ranked as high as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a>. Attention is necessary when using the term shomyo, as its meaning varies depending on the period or situation. The term shomyo itself appeared as early as the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Sengoku Period (period of warring states) (Japan).html">Sengoku Period</a> (Period of Warring States) (Japan) and referred to vassals who controlled a castle, or <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> with a low stipend. </p>
<p>In the Edo period, Buke shohatto (Laws for the Military Houses) initially prescribed that '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> is an owner of a castle with a stipend of not less than 50,000 koku of rice' and 'shomyo is a regional government officer (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Jinya.html">jinya</a>) with a stipend of under 50,000 koku.'<br/>
Accordingly, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> with a stipend of under 50,000 koku or <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Jinya.html">jinya</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> were sometimes referred to as shomyo. </p>
<p>Additionally,vassals with a stipend of not less than 4,000 koku were sometimes referred to as shomyo. </p>
