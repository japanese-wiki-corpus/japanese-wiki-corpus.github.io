<h1>Kuni no miyatsuko (regional governor in ancient Japan) (国造)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kuni no miyatsuko was a post, or an official to the post, placed to govern regions across Japan before the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ritsuryo.html">Ritsuryo</a> legal code system was introduced. It is said that the Japanese reading 'miyatsuko' came from 'Miyatsuko' meaning servants or 'Miyatsuko' meaning retainers of the monarch. </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>Kuni no miyatsuko means the head of kuni, an administrative district of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yamato Kingdom.html">Yamato Kingdom</a>, although the borders of each Kuni are not clearly known because the Ryoseikoku system, or provinces of Japan, was still not well developled. It is considered that the territories that powerful regional clans had long ruled became recognized as countries (kuni) as they were. The prescribed number of Kuni no miyatsuko was not necessarily one; it is supposed that sometimes two or more Kuni no miyatsuko ruled one Kuni. Unlike Agata no nushi, who were highly loyal to the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yamato Kingdom.html">Yamato Kingdom</a>, each Kuni no miyatsuko was originally the regional powerful clan called Kuninushi (lord of the country), and was later appointed as kuni no miyatsuko of his 'country' by the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yamato Kingdom.html">Yamato Kingdom</a> when the 'country' submitted to the Kingdom, being granted to use one of the official family titles of the Kingdom, such as Omi (臣), <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Muraji.html">Muraji</a> (連), Kimi (君), Kimi (公), or Atai (直); and thus each of the district governed by kuni no miyatsuko was autonomous accordingly. For that reason, the official power of Kuni no miyatsuko was so broad that it covered military forces and jurisdiction. It is known that kuni no miyatsuko were involved in various affairs: the kuni no miyatsuko in Togoku took charge of managing Bemin (the people controlled by the authority through various classifications) and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Miyake.html">Miyake</a> (lands directly held by the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yamato Kingdom.html">Yamato Kingdom</a>); the one in Izumo conducted religious ceremonies to govern the territory by religion; and the one in Ki got involved in foreign affairs. And there were some Kuni no miyatsuko who oppsed to the Yamato Kingdon, including the one in Tsukushi, who conquered the entire northern Kyushu. </p>
<p>There is an opinion that the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yamato Kingdom.html">Yamato Kingdom</a> had a well-organized Kokkensei system (country-province system), in which each Kuni ruled by Kuni no miyatsuko included subdistricts called Agata. The actual conditions of regional rule before introduction of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ritsuryo.html">ritsuryo</a> system is not apparent, because there are a lot of things unknown including the actual conditions of the Kuni no miyatsuko system and the relationship between Kuni no miyatsuko and the powerful clans in the capital. </p>
<p>After the Taika reform, the positions of Kuni no miyatsuko became honorary, succeeded by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Heredity.html">heredity</a>, as many kuni no miyatsuko dedicated themselves to preside over religious ceremenies, and the conventional duties of Kunino no miyatsuko were took over by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Gunji.html">Gunji</a> accordingly<br/>
Regions ruled by kuni no miyatsuko were gradually reorganized and merged, or divided to replaced by a 'country' (kuni or province) designated in the legal system (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ritsuryo.html">Ritsuryo</a>) of the ancient Japan<br/>
</p>
<p>There is 'Kuni no miyatsuko Hongi' ('Sendai kuji hongi' Vol. 10), which is a record on the periods of establishment of 135 Kuni no miyatsuko across the country which was founded in the 9th century and the persons who were appointed Kuni no miyatsuko. </p>
<p>Kuni no miyatsuko hongi ko'<br/>
Kuni no miyatsuko hongi ko' written by Hiroshi KURITA in 1861 provides the origin of the document 'Kuni no miyatsuko', indication that it is a forged book, and detailed commentaries on the respective Kuni no miyatsuko. It has been pointed out that 'Kuni no miyatsuko hongi' was a highly esteemed document and not spread widely. </p>
