<p></p>
<p>Genji Shoguns (Warrior Generals) were the Minamoto clan members given the responsibility of seii taishogun (literally, "great general who subdues the barbarians"). In particular, it is said he was a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> (general) who hailed from the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Seiwa-Genji (Minamoto clan).html">Seiwa-Genji</a> (Minamoto clan). </p>
<p><h3>Who were the Genji Shoguns?</h3>
</p>
<p>In a narrow sense, the Genji Shoguns are identified as three generations of Shoguns that commenced with <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Yoritomo.html">MINAMOTO no Yoritomo</a> (who set up the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>)), <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Yoriie.html">MINAMOTO no Yoriie</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Sanetomo.html">MINAMOTO no Sanetomo</a>. In a broader sense, seii taishogun who preceded Yoritomo can be included: <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Yoshinaka.html">MINAMOTO no Yoshinaka</a> and the founder of the Muromachi <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> of the same <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kawachi-Genji.html">Kawachi-Genji</a> (Minamoto clan). Also included is <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Takauji ASHIKAGA.html">Takauji ASHIKAGA</a>, the patriarch of the Ashikaga <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun family.html">Shogun family</a> line. Also supposedly laying claim to the Minamoto clan line is the family of Tokugawa Shoguns who established the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Edo bakufu.html">Edo bakufu</a>. </p>
<p>At the layman's level, a myth about Genji <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> that being Minamoto clan was required to assume the position of seii taishogun. However, initially no such requirement existed. Of course, there are those amongst the Ashikaga and Tokugawa <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> families and so on that took to using the Minamoto clan as part of their name and, their relatives' monopolized aspects of government service on a hereditary basis. Looking back further still to the Heian period, in the timeframe following <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/OTOMO no Otomaro.html">OTOMO no Otomaro</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/SAKANOUE no Tamuramaro.html">SAKANOUE no Tamuramaro</a>'s duties as seii taishogun, taking on the role of seii taishogun was not limited to the Minamoto clan. By contrast, until Yoritomo cousin <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Yoshinaka.html">MINAMOTO no Yoshinaka</a> assumed the mantle of seii taishogun, the Minamoto clan had no claim at all to the title of seii taishogun. This was because in the first instance, the role was assumed by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Chinju-fu (in ancient times).html">Chinju-fu</a> (Pacification and Defense Headquarters) and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Chinju-fu (in ancient times).html">Chinju-fu</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> (Commander-in-Chief of the Defense of the North) both located in Mutsu Province. From around the middle of the Heian period, role of seii taishogun was held as a matter of course by this individual. Furthermore, the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Appointment (Ninkan).html">appointment</a> of Yoshinaka as the initial <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Seiwa-Genji (Minamoto clan).html">Seiwa-Genji</a>'s seii taishogun was unprecedented as Yoshinaka was initially overlooked for the role. It goes without saying therefore, key <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> families with pedigree are not limited to the Minamoto clan. Whichever historical period is reviewed, it is not inevitable that to be <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> one had to be a Minamoto clan. </p>
<p>What is certain is, the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Seiwa-Genji (Minamoto clan).html">Seiwa-Genji</a> was representative of the Minamoto <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> family. From a standpoint of amalgamating the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> forces in the eastern provinces, they were proud of their efforts and having been the family to overwhelm other <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> families. Members of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Seiwa-Genji (Minamoto clan).html">Seiwa-Genji</a> and in particular Yoritomo's <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kawachi-Genji.html">Kawachi-Genji</a> clan were held in high regard for their bravery (along with Minamoto no Yoshiie). As a leading <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> military family, the leaders of the Minamoto clan and its line of eldest sons was the family lineage that managed to unify and amalgamate the forces of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> of the eastern provinces. </p>
<p>For a brief period of time, the Minamoto clan were commanded by imperial order to pursue the enemy Taira family (who had seized real power from the imperial court) and subsequently ordered to hunt down and kill the Taira family. Receiving these commands, the Minamoto clan mobilized its army again but, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> military government powers were established when the Minamoto clan would not take orders from the imperial court ensconced in the eastern provinces. It is thought this outcome is proof positive that the social standing of the Minamoto clan as the supreme military family presence was forged. </p>
<p>That said, the first Japan-wide military rule by a military family was in fact set up by Yoritomo with the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> following the assassination of Sanetomo and after that even though it could be said that Yoritomo was a distant relative (great grandchild), he was invited to establish a system of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> regents by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/FUJIWARA no Yoritsune.html">FUJIWARA no Yoritsune</a>; a fourth generation oldest son lineage from the Fujiwara family line of regents. Subsequently, it appears he was welcomed as a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Miyashogun (shogun from the Imperial Court).html">miyashogun</a> (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> from the Imperial Court) from the Imperial families, so the precedent that one could not become a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> unless of the Minamoto clan stock was overturned at the behest of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> itself. However, Yoritomo was treated as an outsider (even though he came from the same family in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Seiwa-Genji (Minamoto clan).html">Seiwa-Genji</a>) and, was ruined due to doubts about his allegiances. Of course, there are absolutely no doubts that it was commonly thought that Minamoto clan members should be shoguns as it was they who had marshaled the collective power of Japan's <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a>. <h3>At the time Sanetomo was serving as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Tomomasa HIRAGA.html">Tomomasa HIRAGA</a> (who was a Minamoto clan) was providing backing for the removal of Sanetomo and replacement with <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Tokimasa HOJO.html">Tokimasa HOJO</a>.</h3>
</p>
<p>Upon his return to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a>, there were also discussions about him changing his name to Minamoto clan. 
<br/>At the time of the Shimotsuki Sodo (political change of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>), <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/TAIRA no Yoritsuna.html">TAIRA no Yoritsuna</a>'s opponent <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yasumori ADACHI.html">Yasumori ADACHI</a> defamed Regent Sadatoki HOJO by claiming 'there is a plot in essence that Yasumori's child <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Munekage ADACHI.html">Munekage ADACHI</a> is Fujiwara clan therefore unless he changes his name to Minamoto clan he can not become <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a>.'<br/>
</p>
<p>Also, presiding as the seventh <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Imperial Prince Koreyasu.html">Imperial Prince Koreyasu</a> was the first prince to be made <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> without an imperial edict however, subsequently in actuality he became a member of the royal family that was subject to the state and took the Minamoto clan of Koreyasu MINAMOTO. It has been said that Koreyasu (prince of the sixth <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Imperial Prince Munetaka.html">Imperial Prince Munetaka</a>, who himself was Imperial Prince of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Gosaga.html">Emperor Gosaga</a>) had to be demoted from nobility to subject at the behest of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> and, not at the wish of the Imperial family side. </p>
<p>This was because the view that the leader of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">Bakufu</a> had to be a Minamoto (Genji) <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> was deeply rooted amongst lower ranked vassals at that time. However, at the time the real power of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> was held in the hands of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a>'s Regents, the Hojo clan. The <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a>'s position to be precise was no more than as a puppet or symbolic figurehead. From the Hojo clan's viewpoint, they wished to offset a situation where cohesive unifying power were held by the Minamoto clan. In fact, besides <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Imperial Prince Koreyasu.html">Imperial Prince Koreyasu</a> received the title of Imperial Prince by Imperial Order from status of a subject, he was also removed from being <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>. Koreyasu's male cousin <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Imperial Prince Hisaaki (his name can also be read as Hisaakira).html">Imperial Prince Hisaaki</a> (Imperial Prince of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Gofukakusa.html">Emperor Gofukakusa</a>) was a very young child when he assumed the position of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>. Furthermore, there was no demotion from nobility to subject and, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Imperial Prince Morikuni.html">Imperial Prince Morikuni</a>, who also received backing to become a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> as a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Miyashogun (shogun from the Imperial Court).html">miyashogun</a>. </p>
<p>Process of Revival of the Genji Shoguns and Creation of Genji Shogun Legends<br/>
In 1333 the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> collapsed and Emperor Godaigo moved towards setting up a new Kenmu Administration amongst a escalating disturbances across Japan. With this in mind as well, the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Seiwa-Genji (Minamoto clan).html">Seiwa-Genji</a> also looked towards a Genji <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> of the ilk of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Yoritomo.html">MINAMOTO no Yoritomo</a>. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Takauji ASHIKAGA.html">Takauji ASHIKAGA</a> who also shared <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kawachi-Genji.html">Kawachi-Genji</a> origins backed the Northern Dynasty and, served as seii taishogun at the opening of the Muromachi <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> that went on to see a revival in the Genji Shoguns for around the next 120 years. According to the epic war tale "<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Taiheiki (Record of the Great Peace).html">Taiheiki</a>" (the Record of the Great Peace), in 1335 when under the direct rule of Emperor Godaigo, spouting rebellion <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Tokiyuki HOJO.html">Tokiyuki HOJO</a> (orphan of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Takatoki HOJO.html">Takatoki HOJO</a> who had been destroyed along with the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>) marched on <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a>. Whereupon, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Takauji ASHIKAGA.html">Takauji ASHIKAGA</a> stated more or less as follows. 
<br/>Initially for generations seii taishogun was a fellow Genpei (Minamoto clan and Taira clan) clansman but that status has no bearing.'<br/>
This matter at hand in places has deep significance on the profound wishes of Imperial Court and, the families.'<br/>
In other words, in relation to the countless examples of members of the Minamoto and Taira clans serving as seii taishogun, and besides being the recipient of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> proclamations, he wished to report to the Emperor that the Hojo clan had been subjugated. Dismissing these wishes, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Takauji ASHIKAGA.html">Takauji ASHIKAGA</a> took it upon himself to raise an army to suppress the Hojo clan. Without notifying the Imperial Court, in order to make plans to subjugate <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> families in various provinces, it was made to look as if the subjugation drive emanated from the Imperial court. With fresh backing from the Northern Dynasty and serving as seii taishogun, he established Muromachi <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> and revived the Genji <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a>. The house of Ashikaga <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> families was the same as what was previously the house of Genji Shoguns. 
<br/><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Monopolization.html">Monopolization</a> of the role of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> continued and emphasis on the legitimacy of their control possible misunderstandings can be seen such as 'the chief of military government should be Minamoto clan ' or 'to be <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> one had to be Minamoto clan.'<br/>
However, the Muromachi <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> was substantially destroyed during the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Sengoku Period (period of warring states) (Japan).html">Sengoku Period</a> (Period of Warring States). <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Nobunaga ODA.html">Nobunaga ODA</a> calling himself a Taira, distinguished himself as the new pre-eminent leader at a that time, is said to have been assumed by the Imperial Court whatever official role he wished: Seii taishogun, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daijo-daijin (Grand minister of state).html">Daijo-daijin</a> (Grand minister of state) or Kanpaku (chief adviser to the Emperor) ('sanshoku suinin mondai' (the question of the three alternative positions)). It therefore can not be justified to say only Minamoto clan were allowed to be <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> as there were limitations to a Genji <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> obtaining any role they happened to desire. However, Nobunaga's successor, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI.html">Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI</a> managed to unify the whole country and also sought the role of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a>. It is said that Hideyoshi took it upon himself to dismiss requests from <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshiaki ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshiaki ASHIKAGA</a>, 15th generation of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> in the Muromachi <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>, to adopt Hideyoshi as his child. In addition, subsequently <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Ieyasu TOKUGAWA.html">Ieyasu TOKUGAWA</a> who had assumed the Fujiwara clan was as a Minamoto clan appointed as seii taishogun and, notwithstanding in each case the three founders of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> regimes in Japan's history had come from Minamoto clan stock, the Minamoto clan legend that only a Minamoto clan could be <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> and, Minamoto clan belief came into existence. </p>
