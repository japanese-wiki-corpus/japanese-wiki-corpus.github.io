<h1>Choteki (朝敵)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>"Choteki" refers to those who inflict vengeance on the emperor (imperial line) in Japan. </p>
<p>Similar to 'traitor,' it is a word chanted by those supported by, or who won over the emperor or Imperial Court in the era, to conspire political elimination of the political (or at times, military) adversary. In many cases, they were targeted for murder by the side chanting the word. When the side claiming to be the government army was dominant, no matter for what reason, those who were called this name was considered 'evil' in Japanese politics, at the time. </p>

<p>Imperial Princes sometimes called one another choteki when they were in conflict, and it was considered a claim for legitimacy or declaration of war. </p>
