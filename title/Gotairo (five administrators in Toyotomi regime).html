<h1>Gotairo (five administrators in Toyotomi regime) (五大老)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Gotairo indicates the five most powerful <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> clans, appointed as Karo (or <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Tairo (chief minister).html">Tairo</a>) of the Toyotomi family, and acted as executive organs of the Toyotomi Administration at the last days of the administration, during the Bunroku era (1593-1598). In those days, they were called 'Gonin <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Bugyo.html">bugyo</a>,' but it became quite confusing with 'Gonin <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Gobugyo (magistrates of Toyotomi Administration).html">gobugyo</a>' during the Edo period (though they were mainly called 'Gonin <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Otoshiyori.html">otoshiyori</a>' at the time); as a result, the term 'Gotairo' was coined later to indicate the former to distinguish between them. </p>
<p><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI.html">Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI</a> established a council system of Gotairo to support his son Hideyori in case of his death, expecting the five members to balance each other to prevent the possible emergence of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Ieyasu TOKUGAWA.html">Ieyasu TOKUGAWA</a>. However, the council system became merely nominal through Ieyasu's frequent covenant violations. Gotairo prevented <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Ieyasu TOKUGAWA.html">Ieyasu TOKUGAWA</a> from surpassing the Toyotomi family until the death of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Toshiie MAEDA.html">Toshiie MAEDA</a> in 1599, though they could not stop Ieyasu to be dominating. </p>
