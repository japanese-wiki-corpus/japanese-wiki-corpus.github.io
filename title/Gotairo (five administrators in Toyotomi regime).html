<h1>Gotairo (five administrators in Toyotomi regime) (五大老)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Gotairo indicates the five most powerful daimyo clans, appointed as Karo (or Tairo) of the Toyotomi family, and acted as executive organs of the Toyotomi Administration at the last days of the administration, during the Bunroku era (1593-1598). In those days, they were called 'Gonin bugyo,' but it became quite confusing with 'Gonin gobugyo' during the Edo period (though they were mainly called 'Gonin otoshiyori' at the time); as a result, the term 'Gotairo' was coined later to indicate the former to distinguish between them. </p>
<p>Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI established a council system of Gotairo to support his son Hideyori in case of his death, expecting the five members to balance each other to prevent the possible emergence of Ieyasu TOKUGAWA. However, the council system became merely nominal through Ieyasu's frequent covenant violations. Gotairo prevented Ieyasu TOKUGAWA from surpassing the Toyotomi family until the death of Toshiie MAEDA in 1599, though they could not stop Ieyasu to be dominating. </p>
