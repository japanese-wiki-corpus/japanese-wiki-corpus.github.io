<h1>Goi no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kurodo (Chamberlain).html">Kurodo</a> (Chamberlain of Fifth Rank) (五位蔵人)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Goi no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kurodo (Chamberlain).html">Kurodo</a> was a post of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Ryoge no kan (class outside of the Ritsuryo system).html">Ryoge no kan</a> (class outside of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ritsuryo.html">Ritsuryo</a> system) under the Japanese <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ritsuryo.html">Ritsuryo</a> system (a system of centralized government based on the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ritsuryo.html">ritsuryo</a> code). This post was equivalent to a Suke (assistant director) at the Kurododokoro (Chamberlain's Office) and was placed immediately under the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kurodo no to (the name of a post).html">Kurodo no to</a> (Head Chamberlain). Up to two to three personnel could be appointed to this post, and they were selected from among the Tenjobito (a high-ranking courtier allowed into the Imperial Palace) of the Fifth Rank, with particular favor for individuals from families of nobility and who were scholarly gifted. </p>
<p>The term "Goi no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kurodo (Chamberlain).html">Kurodo</a>" first appeared in the notes on Udain in the "Shikijibunin" (directory of officials) which explained, 'On January 6, 889, two persons were appointed to Goi no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kurodo (Chamberlain).html">Kurodo</a>, and another two persons were subsequently appointed to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Rokui no Kurodo (a government post).html">Rokui no Kurodo</a>.'<br/>
The first two persons to be appointed as Goi no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kurodo (Chamberlain).html">Kurodo</a> were named MINAMOTO no Tatsu and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Toshiyuki.html">FUJIWARA no Toshiyuki</a>, after which the term appeared frequently. The post of Goi no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kurodo (Chamberlain).html">Kurodo</a> had existed beforehand as well, but there was also the post of Mui no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kurodo (Chamberlain).html">Kurodo</a> (Chamberlain with No Rank), meaning that the official ranks for eight positions of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kurodo (Chamberlain).html">Kurodo</a> were not always standardized. During that time, it was difficult to classify every official as a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kurodo (Chamberlain).html">Kurodo</a> because there was a clear distinction between the Fifth and Sixth ranks in terms of social status, as well as considerable differences between their social activities and custom rituals. As official duties of the Kurododokoro were gradually specialized, social status became closely related to who was posted where. It is believed that this lead to the establishment of the Goi no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kurodo (Chamberlain).html">Kurodo</a> post and the reason behind the improvements to the corresponding organizational infrastructure. </p>
<p>From that <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Point (Sentoki).html">point</a> on, when a person holding the post of Goi no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kurodo (Chamberlain).html">Kurodo</a> was promoted to the Fourth Rank, or when a person holding the post of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Rokui no Kurodo (a government post).html">Rokui no Kurodo</a> (Chamberlain of Sixth Rank) was promoted to the Fifth Rank, rather than being allowed to remain as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kurodo (Chamberlain).html">Kurodo</a> with a new rank, their court rank and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kurodo (Chamberlain).html">Kurodo</a> posts became inseparable and the posts of Goi no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kurodo (Chamberlain).html">Kurodo</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Rokui no Kurodo (a government post).html">Rokui no Kurodo</a> were regarded as the names of official posts. </p>
