<h1>Joro <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Otoshiyori.html">otoshiyori</a> (上臈御年寄)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Joro <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Otoshiyori.html">otoshiyori</a> is the title of women serving in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/O-oku.html">O-oku</a> during the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Edo Period.html">Edo Period</a>. The title is abbreviated as joro at times. These women were allowed direct contact with the Tokugawa <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> family and their wives and ranked the highest in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/O-oku.html">O-oku</a>. </p>
<p><h3>Duties and position</h3>
</p>
<p>The joro <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Otoshiyori.html">otoshiyori</a> is the official responsible for social, cultural and other important ceremonies and served as advisor to the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> and his wife. </p>
<p>Many of the women who rose to the position came from noble families of Kyo and were well-versed in court protocols, laws and special events and are believed to have accompanies the bride to wed the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> and live in the Edo Castle. </p>
<p>Although ranking the highest among the women of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/O-oku.html">O-oku</a>, they are believed to have wielded little influence within Ooku, due to the lack of opportunity to influence the shogunate's policy on court nobility or due to the fact that the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>'s wife had little power. For this reason, lower-ranking toshiyori actually held the highest authority in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/O-oku.html">O-oku</a>, dominating all important and lesser matters. </p>
<p>Notwithstanding, there were joro <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Otoshiyori.html">otoshiyori</a> who demonstrated influence over shogunate policy, such as Uemon no suke no tsubone during the reign of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Tsunayoshi TOKUGAWA.html">Tsunayoshi TOKUGAWA</a>, Takakoka during the reign of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Ieharu TOKUGAWA.html">Ieharu TOKUGAWA</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Anekoji.html">Anekoji</a> under <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Ieyoshi TOKUGAWA.html">Ieyoshi TOKUGAWA</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Utahashi.html">Utahashi</a> under <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Iesada TOKUGAWA.html">Iesada TOKUGAWA</a>, showing that "absence of power" was not necessarily true. </p>
