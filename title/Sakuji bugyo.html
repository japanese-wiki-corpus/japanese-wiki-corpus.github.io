<h1>Sakuji <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Bugyo.html">bugyo</a> (作事奉行)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Sakuji <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Bugyo.html">bugyo</a> was a post held by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Hatamoto (direct retainers of shogun).html">hatamoto</a> during the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Edo Period.html">Edo Period</a>. The post was involved in hoi (traditional everyday clothes). </p>
<p>It was established in 1632. The post covered administration of construction and maintenance under the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> government. Specializing chiefly in woodworks, the sakuji <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Bugyo.html">bugyo</a> administered carpenters and other craftsmen in the areas of detailed works, tatami mats and garden plants. Starting in 1662, shumon aratame-yaku (officer in charge of persecuting Christians) began to take on this duty concurrently. The post was abolished in 1792. </p>
<p>Along with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Fushin.html">fushin</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Bugyo.html">bugyo</a> and kofushin <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Bugyo.html">bugyo</a>, the three posts were known as shimosan <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Bugyo.html">bugyo</a> (three commissioners, mainly in charge of repair and management). </p>
<p>The sakuji <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Bugyo.html">bugyo</a>'s salary was 2100-koku rice yield but was changed to 2000 ryo (gold pieces) in 1867. There were two to three appointed to the post. The office for the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Bugyo.html">bugyo</a> was located next to a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Metsuke (a governmental post of the Edo bakufu).html">metsuke</a> (inspector of foot soldiers) office at the far end of a building between a storage room and a castle's middle gate. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> daikugashira, daikugashira (construction prefect), sakuji shita-bugyo, tatami <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Bugyo.html">bugyo</a> (tatami magistrate), <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Saikudokoro (tooling office).html">saikudokoro</a> gashira (tooling office head), kanjoyaku todori (chief of accounts), sakujikata <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Hikan (low ranking clerks).html">hikan</a> (construction low-level bureaucrat), <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kawara (tile).html">kawara</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Bugyo.html">bugyo</a> (roof tile magistrate), ueki <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Bugyo.html">bugyo</a> (garden magistrate) and sakujikata niwasaku were under the sakuji <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Bugyo.html">bugyo</a>. </p>
