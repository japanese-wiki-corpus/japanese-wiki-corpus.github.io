<h1>Sakuji bugyo (作事奉行)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Sakuji bugyo was a post held by hatamoto during the Edo Period. The post was involved in hoi (traditional everyday clothes). </p>
<p>It was established in 1632. The post covered administration of construction and maintenance under the bakufu government. Specializing chiefly in woodworks, the sakuji bugyo administered carpenters and other craftsmen in the areas of detailed works, tatami mats and garden plants. Starting in 1662, shumon aratame-yaku (officer in charge of persecuting Christians) began to take on this duty concurrently. The post was abolished in 1792. </p>
<p>Along with fushin bugyo and kofushin bugyo, the three posts were known as shimosan bugyo (three commissioners, mainly in charge of repair and management). </p>
<p>The sakuji bugyo's salary was 2100-koku rice yield but was changed to 2000 ryo (gold pieces) in 1867. There were two to three appointed to the post. The office for the bugyo was located next to a metsuke (inspector of foot soldiers) office at the far end of a building between a storage room and a castle's middle gate. Kyoto daikugashira, daikugashira (construction prefect), sakuji shita-bugyo, tatami bugyo (tatami magistrate), saikudokoro gashira (tooling office head), kanjoyaku todori (chief of accounts), sakujikata hikan (construction low-level bureaucrat), kawara bugyo (roof tile magistrate), ueki bugyo (garden magistrate) and sakujikata niwasaku were under the sakuji bugyo. </p>
