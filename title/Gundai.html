<h1>Gundai (郡代)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Gundai （a magistrate of a region or an administrator of a town) is the name of a post set in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>) and in clan domains from the Muromachi period to the Edo period. The post was also referred to as Koribugyo (magistrate of a country). </p>
<p>Muromachi period<br/>
The post of Gundai was created when a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shugodai.html">Shugodai</a> (deputy of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a>; provincial constable) who had been exercising military and police powers during the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period began taking charge of affairs related to taxation (tax collection) as well at the start of the Muromachi period. Gundai or Koribugyo was generally used to refer to a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daikan (local governor).html">Daikan</a> (local governor) who controlled a unit of Gun (country) under the direction of a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shugodai.html">Shugodai</a>, but there were also times when these terms were also used to refer to a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shugodai.html">Shugodai</a>. A person with this position had one or two countries under their jurisdiction. </p>
<p>Edo period<br/>
During the Edo period, Gundai was a post set within the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> as well as in each domain. </p>
<p>Within the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>, the post referred to a local governor (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daikan (local governor).html">Daikan</a>) who controlled a relatively wide extension of government territory. Early on during the Edo period, aside from the Kanto region, a Gundai post was set in almost all of the provinces, including <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kamigata.html">Kamigata</a>, Amagasaki, Mikawa, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/railway/Tanba (train).html">Tanba</a> and Kawachi. In 1642, the Kanjogashira sei (a system controlled by a chief financial officer) was established, which put Gundai and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daikan (local governor).html">Daikan</a> under its jurisdiction, but Kanto Gundai was brought under the control of the Roju (members of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a>'s council of elders) later on. After the middle Edo period, the number of Gundai was reduced to four: Kanto Gundai, Mino Gundai, Saigokusuji Gundai (Kyushu region) and Hida Gundai. The status and rank of a Gundai was higher than that of a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daikan (local governor).html">Daikan</a>, but the scope of the work between the two was nearly the same. In the early Edo period, the post called Koridaikan (local governor of a country) was set up under control of the Roju and had nearly all the same duties, but was abolished in 1668. </p>
<p>A Gundai or Koribugyo was set up in each domain in order to administer government in directly controlled clan territories. </p>
