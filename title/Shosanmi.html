<h1>Shosanmi (正三位)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Shosanmi (Senior Third Rank) is one of the ranks in Ikai (court ranks) and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinkai.html">Shinkai</a> (ranks granted to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> gods). This rank is lower than <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Junii (Junior Second Rank).html">Junii</a> (Junior Second Rank) and higher than <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Jusanmi.html">Jusanmi</a> (Junior Third Rank). This rank is also called 'Ooimitsunokurai' in Japan. </p>
<p>Shosanmi<br/>
Under the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ritsuryo.html">ritsuryo</a> system (a system of centralized government based on the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ritsuryo.html">ritsuryo</a> code), ranks higher than <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Jusanmi.html">Jusanmi</a> were called 'Ki' as well as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Hoshi.html">Hoshi</a> no kurai (positions of stars), and were the ranks for <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kugyo.html">Kugyo</a> (the top court officials). </p>
<p>While <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Jusanmi.html">Jusanmi</a> was equivalent to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Chunagon.html">Chunagon</a> (a vice-councilor of state), <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Konoe no daisho.html">Konoe no daisho</a> (Major Captain of the Palace Guards) as well as Dazai-no-sotsu (Director of Dazaifu [Kyushu branch government]), Shosanmi was the equivalent of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Dainagon (chief councilor of state).html">Dainagon</a> (a chief councilor of state). In the orders of merit, Shosanmi is equivalent to the First Order of Merit. </p>
<p>Later on, the conferment of a court rank and the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Appointment (Ninkan).html">appointment</a> to an office were progressively made regardless of Kanisoto (the bureaucratic system according to Ikai [court rank] in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ritsuryo.html">ritsuryo</a> system). Since the Ikai of Dinagon was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Junii (Junior Second Rank).html">Junii</a> and that of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Konoe no daisho.html">Konoe no daisho</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Konoefu (Headquarters of the Inner Palace Guards).html">Konoefu</a> (the Headquarters of the Inner Palace Guards) was the second or third rank, the ikai of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Chunagon.html">Chunagon</a> was Shosanmi in some cases. </p>
<p>After the modern ages, Shosanmi was conferred on Hakushaku (a count) of the peerage as his first Ikai, and also Army Generals and Full Admirals rose to Shosanmi. Nowadays, Shosanmi is posthumously conferred on the people who were ministers of state, had an important government position, or made great academic achievements. </p>
