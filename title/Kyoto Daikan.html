<p><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daikan (local governor).html">daikan</a> was a post of an officer which was set up in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> in the Edo period under the control of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shoshidai.html">shoshidai</a> (the chief administrator of the imperial capital and of imperial lands), mainly administering the finance of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Edo bakufu.html">Edo bakufu</a> and the Imperial court in Kinai (the five kuni in the immediate vicinity of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>), such as administrating <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Tenryo (Shogunal Demesne).html">tenryo</a> (bakufu-owned land), fief of the imperial family, and fief of the nobilities. It was called <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Gundai.html">gundai</a> in the beginning. </p>
<p>In 1635, Toyonao GOMI was appointed as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daikan (local governor).html">daikan</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Bugyo.html">bugyo</a> (magistrate) in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and set up an encampment called <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Gundai.html">gundai</a> in the west side of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Nijo-jo Castle.html">Nijo-jo Castle</a>, which is allegedly the origin of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daikan (local governor).html">daikan</a>. At the outset, it dealt with lawsuits in the Kinai together with Fushimi <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Bugyo.html">bugyo</a> and had jurisdiction over <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> city with the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shoshidai.html">shoshidai</a>, eventually the job became busy. For this reason, duties of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daikan (local governor).html">daikan</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Bugyo.html">bugyo</a> were divided between Toyomune GOMI, who was a son of Toyonao and succeeded his father's duty after his death, and Masasada KOIDE who had been in the post of Fushimi <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Bugyo.html">bugyo</a> in 1660, and Toyomune GOMI took over the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daikan (local governor).html">daikan</a>'s duty. This is allegedly how <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daikan (local governor).html">daikan</a> launched, although there has been another view that it started in 1664 when Shigetatsu SUZUKI, who had succeeded Toyomune GOMI, was appointed as the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daikan (local governor).html">daikan</a>. Four years later, duties including that of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shoshidai.html">shoshidai</a> were reorganized, thus the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> machibugyo was inaugurated as a new system. The position was succeeded by Toyomune GOMI again, however, after his death in 1680, it was succeeded by Masanori KOBORI, and since then by the Kobori clan hereditarily. </p>
<p>When Masanori was in the position, a fief of 600 koku and a 1000 hyo executive allowance, and status of Tsutsuji no mazume were set for the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daikan (local governor).html">daikan</a>. As it administered the duties of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Nijo-jo Castle.html">Nijo-jo Castle</a> and the Court, it had many subordinates numbering about 20 to 30 normally and 60 or more at the most. </p>
<p>Its position and duties are:<br/>
administration of the Court fief, court nobles, and deputies to collect tax, and so on,<br/>
</p>
<p>maintenance and repair of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Nijo-jo Castle.html">Nijo-jo Castle</a>,<br/>
</p>
<p>provision of executive allowance for temples and shrines in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>,<br/>
</p>
<p>administration of important points in river traffic in Yamashiro Province at Katsura, Kizucho, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Uji City.html">Uji City</a>, Kamo, and Yodo, and<br/>
</p>
<p>administration of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Tenryo (Shogunal Demesne).html">tenryo</a> in Yamashiro, Settsu, Kawachi, and Tanba Provinces. Also, as a result of negotiation with the Osaka machibugyo about management, it held an additional post of Osaka funate kaku (a class of profession in Osaka whose role was to be in charge of chartered ship management and maritime inspections) for a period. </p>
