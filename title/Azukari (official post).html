<h1>Azukari (official post) (預 (官職))</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Azukari was a post which was set up at government offices, temples or shrines and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> (manor) in the Heian period. </p>
<p>According to "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Engishiki.html">Engishiki</a>" (an ancient book for codes and procedures on national rites and prayers), Azukari was set up at <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daijokan chuke.html">Daijokan chuke</a> (kitchen of the Great Council of State) and Daijokan fumidono (repository of documents). In the 10th century, Azukari was set up at various government offices including, without limitation, Goin (retired emperor's palace), In no cho (retired emperor's office), Shinmotsudokoro (serving office), Kokusoin (office of storehouses), <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kokuga (provincial government office compounds).html">Kokuga</a> (provincial government office) and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Gunga (county district offices).html">Gunga</a> (country government office). In the case of central government offices, Azukari was normally placed under Betto (head of office) and supervised practical jobs instead of Betto who was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kugyo.html">kugyo</a> (top court noble). Azukari was sometimes placed next to Betto and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shitsuji.html">Shitsuji</a> (steward) at In no cho, but the ranking of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shitsuji.html">Shitsuji</a> and Betto was different depending on government offices. It is said that the post of Nenyo (subordinate of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shitsuji.html">Shitsuji</a>), whose term was one year, derived from Azukari. </p>
<p>Azukari was set up at <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> as a post which was responsible for the on-site management of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> and in the case of temples or shrines, Azukari was set up as the post which was responsible for the management of temples or shrines. At Kasuga Taisha Shrine and Iwashimizu Hachimangu Shrine, Sho no Azukari (head custodian) and Gon no Azukari (assistant custodian) were set up as senior posts for <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> priest. </p>
