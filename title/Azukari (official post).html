<h1>Azukari (official post) (預 (官職))</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Azukari was a post which was set up at government offices, temples or shrines and shoen (manor) in the Heian period. </p>
<p>According to "Engishiki" (an ancient book for codes and procedures on national rites and prayers), Azukari was set up at Daijokan chuke (kitchen of the Great Council of State) and Daijokan fumidono (repository of documents). In the 10th century, Azukari was set up at various government offices including, without limitation, Goin (retired emperor's palace), In no cho (retired emperor's office), Shinmotsudokoro (serving office), Kokusoin (office of storehouses), Kokuga (provincial government office) and Gunga (country government office). In the case of central government offices, Azukari was normally placed under Betto (head of office) and supervised practical jobs instead of Betto who was kugyo (top court noble). Azukari was sometimes placed next to Betto and Shitsuji (steward) at In no cho, but the ranking of Shitsuji and Betto was different depending on government offices. It is said that the post of Nenyo (subordinate of Shitsuji), whose term was one year, derived from Azukari. </p>
<p>Azukari was set up at shoen as a post which was responsible for the on-site management of shoen and in the case of temples or shrines, Azukari was set up as the post which was responsible for the management of temples or shrines. At Kasuga Taisha Shrine and Iwashimizu Hachimangu Shrine, Sho no Azukari (head custodian) and Gon no Azukari (assistant custodian) were set up as senior posts for Shinto priest. </p>
