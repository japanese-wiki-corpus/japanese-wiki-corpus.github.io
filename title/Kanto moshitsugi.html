<h1>Kanto <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Moshitsugi.html">moshitsugi</a> (関東申次)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kanto <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Moshitsugi.html">moshitsugi</a>, also called Knato shisso, was a post introduced in the imperial court during the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period and played, together with the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Rokuhara Tandai (an administrative and judicial agency in Rokuhara, Kyoto).html">Rokuhara Tandai</a> (an administrative and judicial agency in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Rokuhara.html">Rokuhara</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>) on the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>) side, the role of doing communications and adjustments between the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> and the imperial court or the government by cloistered emperors. Initially, a specific court noble privately designated by the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> assumed the post, but after <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Michiie KUJO.html">Michiie KUJO</a> lost his position in 1246, it became an official post designated by the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> and the post was hereditarily assumed effectevely by the head of the Saionji family that had a marital relation with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Yoritomo.html">MINAMOTO no Yoritomo</a> (his niece entered the Saionji family through a marriage). After the Jokyu War (the war in the Jokyu era), when the imperial court was going to decide an imprtant matter, it became basically necessary for the imperial court to get its persmission from the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> through the Kanto <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Moshitsugi.html">moshitsugi</a>, and its power increased: For example, when the battle betwwen <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Daikakuji-to.html">Daikakuji-to</a> (imperial lineage starting with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Kameyama.html">Emperor Kameyama</a>) and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Jimyoin-to.html">Jimyoin-to</a> (imperial lineage from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Gofukakusa.html">Emperor Gofukakusa</a> to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Gokomatsu.html">Emperor Gokomatsu</a>) became serious concerning the imperial succession problem, the imperial succession problem or personel affairs in the imperial court became to be seriously affected by opinions of Kanto <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Moshitsugi.html">moshitsugi</a>. However, when Kanto <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Moshitsugi.html">moshitsugi</a> gradually sided more with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Jimyoin-to.html">Jimyoin-to</a> due to a private relationship of the head of the Saionji family and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Daikakuji-to.html">Daikakuji-to</a> (the head was on bad terms with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Daikakuji-to.html">Daikakuji-to</a>), <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Daikakuji-to.html">Daikakuji-to</a> came to communicate with the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> directly, and Kanto <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Moshitsugi.html">moshitsugi</a> came to lose its power rapidly as the 14-th century started. Then, after Daikakuji-to Emperor Godaigo defeated the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>, the Saionji family was badly criticized, and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Dainagon (chief councilor of state).html">Dainagon</a> (chief councilor of state), <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Kinmune SAIONJI.html">Kinmune SAIONJI</a>, who was the last Kanto <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Moshitsugi.html">moshitsugi</a>, was executed on suspicion of a rebellion. </p>
