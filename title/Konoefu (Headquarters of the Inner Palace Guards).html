<p></p>
<p>Konoefu was one of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Ryoge no kan (class outside of the Ritsuryo system).html">Ryoge no kan</a> (official organizations outside of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Ritsuryo.html">Ritsuryo</a> code). It was established in 765 by reorganizing Jutoei. Sakonoefu (the Left Division of Inner Palace Guards) and Ukonoefu (the Right Division of Inner Palace Guards) existed. Its head was <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Konoe no daisho.html">Konoe no daisho</a> (Major Captain of the Inner Palace Guards) (Sakonoe no daisho (Major captain of the Left Division of Inner Palace Guards) for Sakonoefu, Ukonoe no daisho (Major captain of the Right Division of Inner Palace Guards)) for Ukonoefu, respectively. Along with (Left and Right) <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Emonfu (Headquarters of the Outer Palace Gate Guard).html">Emonfu</a> (Headquarters of the Outer Palace Guards) and (Left and Right) <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Hyoefu (the Middle Palace Guards).html">Hyoefu</a> (Headquarters of the Middle Palace Guards), they are collectively called 'Rokuefu' (six guard divisions). 
<br/>Its other names were 'Okichi-kakimamori' and 'Chikaki-mamorinotsukasa.'<br/>
</p>
<p><h3>Transition</h3>
</p>
<p>On March 2, 765, Jutoei was reorganized into Konoefu and on June 5, 807, Konoefu and Chuefu became Sakonoefu and Ukonoefu as the result of the reorganization of Chuefu and Konoefu. Incidentally, although there used to be Gaiefu, its jobs were distributed to (Left and Right) Konoefu when they were established. <h3>Official posts at Konoefu</h3>

</p>
<p>One person was appointed for each of the Left Division and Right Division. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Gonkan.html">Gonkan</a> (provisional post) didn't exist.

Since then, the above became established. Although this post corresponded to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Jusanmi.html">Jusanmi</a>, it was a more important post than <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Dainagon (chief councilor of state).html">Dainagon</a> (chief councilor of state). This post was concurrently assumed by a person whose post was <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Sangi.html">sangi</a> (councilor) or higher in ancient times, but a person whose post was <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Dainagon (chief councilor of state).html">Dainagon</a> or higher was regularly appointed to this post since the middle of the Heian period. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Konoe no daisho.html">Konoe no daisho</a> sometimes concurrently assumed the post of 'Umagogen' (head of Imperial stable). <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Konoe no daisho.html">Konoe no daisho</a> was sometimes called by its Tang name Urin taishogun, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Shinei.html">Shinei</a> taishogun or Koga taishogun.
