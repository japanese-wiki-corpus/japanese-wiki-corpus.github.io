<h1>Daijokan chuke (太政官厨家)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The Daijokan chuke essentially indicated the kitchen that belonged to the Daijokan (Grand Council of State), but in ancient times the term referred to the government officials who administered the Daijokan kitchen. </p>
<p>The primary duties of the Daijokan chuke were to provide any equipment or novelties needed in order to prepare food served at conferences and events in the Daijokan. Concurrently, other duties included the administration of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Jishi.html">jishi</a> (land rent paid by farmers) on <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Koden.html">koden</a> (or <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Joden.html">joden</a>) (field administered directly by a ruler) that were set aside to cover their food and expenses, they also handled payments of wages in rice and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Jifuku (Clothes of the Season).html">jifuku</a> (seasonal clothing) for everyone from Daijokan officials under the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Benkan (Collective name of posts in Daijokan).html">Benkan</a> (division of the Daijokan responsible for controlling central and provincial governmental offices) to servants who did menial labor. </p>
<p>According to the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Engishiki.html">Engishiki</a> (codes and procedures on national rites and prayers), one officer at a time from the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shonagon (Post in Daijokan).html">Shonagon</a> (lesser councilor of state), <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Benkan (Collective name of posts in Daijokan).html">Benkan</a> (oversight department), Geki (Secretary of the Grand Council of State) and Shi (Officials in charge of records) each held the position of Betto as the person in charge concurrently with their normal position. Following this example, officers were assigned one at a time as an <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Azukari (official post).html">azukari</a> (deputy) of Shisho (official in charge of miscellaneous documents) at the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shonagon (Post in Daijokan).html">Shonagon</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Benkan (Collective name of posts in Daijokan).html">Benkan</a> bureaus. The duty was part of a shift system with a term of one year each, ending every year in February at the Rekken Ceremony (an annual ritual during the Heian and Nara Periods in which officers were evaluated for promotions). </p>
<p>Koden <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Jishi.html">Jishi</a> (land taxes) were delivered to the Daijokan chuke in the form of shomai (rice that has been pounded in a mortar) and keika (軽貨) along with reishinnomotsu (例進納物) from various provinces. Later on, however, due to the collapse of the handensei (state controlled land allotment system), the increase of iden (fields allotted according to court rank) and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kokushi.html">Kokushi</a> (provincial governors) converting <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Jishi.html">jishi</a> to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shozei (the rice tax stored in provincial offices warehouse).html">shozei</a> (rice taxed by provincial offices), the number of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Joden.html">joden</a>, which were essentially the extra fields of handen (allotted fields), were gradually decreased along with their <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Jishi.html">jishi</a>. As a result, a variety of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shoen.html">Shoen</a> (manor) called a Ben no ho was established in place of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Joden.html">joden</a>. Although it was originally intended for the Daijokan chuke to be administered jointly by the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shonagon (Post in Daijokan).html">Shonagon</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Benkan (Collective name of posts in Daijokan).html">Benkan</a> bureaus, it ended up being solely administered by the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Benkan (Collective name of posts in Daijokan).html">Benkan</a> bureau once the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shonagon (Post in Daijokan).html">Shonagon</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shonagon (Post in Daijokan).html">Shonagon</a> bureau lost their substance due to the establishment of the Kurododokoro (Board of Archivists). In addition, remaining <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Joden.html">joden</a> and Ben no ho effectively became territory of the Ozuki clan who passed their service as Kanmu (also known as Sadaishi which was the senior recorder of the left) from one generation to the next. </p>
