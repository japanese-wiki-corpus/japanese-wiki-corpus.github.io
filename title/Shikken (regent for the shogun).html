<h1>Shikken (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Regent.html">regent</a> for the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>) (執権)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Shikken is a name of a post in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>). Shikken supported Kamakura-dono (another name for <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> and it often meant the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> as well) and controlled the affairs of state. Originally, Shikken was the name of the post which was the director of Board of Administration called Mandokoro-betto. During the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period, Mandokoro-betto in In-no-cho (department under the direct control of the retired emperor) was also called Shikken by following the way that the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> called it. </p>
<p><h3>History</h3>
</p>
<p>The first so-called "Shikken" was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Tokimasa HOJO.html">Tokimasa HOJO</a> who was the father of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Masako HOJO.html">Masako HOJO</a>, the wife of the first shogun Yoritomo MINAMOTO. SinceTokimasa was appointed to the post of Shikken, he provided the Hojo family with a foothold of their political power. Since the second Shikken <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshitoki HOJO.html">Yoshitoki HOJO</a> started serving also as Samuraidokoro-betto (board of retainers), Shikken practically became the highest post in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>. After the third generation Sanetomo MINAMOTO died and the rule of Minamoto Shoguns came to an end, Shikken took the control of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>. </p>
<p>After the sixth generation Nagatoki HOJO, Shikken had become appointed also from those other than <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/family/Tokuso.html">Tokuso</a> (the patrimonial head of the main branch of the Hojo clan), which was a mainline of the Hojo clan. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/family/Tokuso.html">Tokuso</a> and the post of Shikken had become separated since then, and the actual power in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> was held by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/family/Tokuso.html">Tokuso</a>, then Shikken became only a nominal post. Moreover, during the days of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Takatoki HOJO.html">Takatoki HOJO</a>, the Nagasaki family at the butler-like position for the Hojo clan, which was called Uchi-Kanrei (head of Tokuso Family), started seizing power. </p>
