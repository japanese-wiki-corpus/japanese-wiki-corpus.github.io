<h1>Banshu (番衆)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>"Banshu"(a guard) is a person who keeps watch at night as part of guard group (ban). In a more limited sense, it refers to a person stationed in an office of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>) who stood guard for the seii taishogun (literally, "great general who subdues the barbarians") and his palace. </p>
<p>It is said that Banshu in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> originally derives from the fact that in the time of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Yoritomo.html">MINAMOTO no Yoritomo</a> and the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>, he arranged for gokenins (immediate vassals of the shogunate) with skill in bow and arrow to stay close to him night and day. After <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MINAMOTO no Sanetomo.html">MINAMOTO no Sanetomo</a> was assassinated, Kozamurai dokoro (the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a>'s guard) was set up, and a system of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Koban.html">Koban</a> (small watch teams) was created, which consisted of 6 teams on a rotating 24 hour watch. Under <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Koban.html">Koban</a>, there were several sub-teams such as Kinjuban (a bodyguard for the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>), Hisashiban (a person who keeps night watch under the eaves of building), and Moshitsugiban (a post to attend to visitors), and the powerful gokenins' sons were appointed. They formed a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> kinshuso (a class of shogunal bodyguards), which sometimes became a counterweight to the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Regent.html">regent</a>'s power, and provoked political conflicts. </p>
<p>In the Muromachi <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>, the same system was used, and later it developed into the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Hokoshu.html">Hokoshu</a> (the shogunal military guard), which was made up of five teams. They not only guarded the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> but also played a central role in the military force directly controlled by him, with privileges granted by the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>, such as Kyosei (the right to direct tax payment of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Tansen.html">tansen</a>, a kind of provisional tax imposed on the Imperial or shogunate family's estate and his private estate and paid to the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> without any intermediaries such as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a>) and sanctuary from interference by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a>. In addition, the concept of Banshu came to be applied to the status of samurais and their family ranking, and based on this concept job titles such as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shobanshu.html">Shobanshu</a> (officials who accompany the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>), <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Otomoshu.html">Otomoshu</a> (a group that accompanied the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>), <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Moshitsugishu.html">Moshitsugishu</a> (a person in charge of conveying messages to the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>), and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Naidanshu (judges).html">Naidanshu</a> (judges) were created. </p>
<p>Also, in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Edo bakufu.html">Edo bakufu</a>, the Muromachi system was retained as one of the good practices of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> families, and part of it was used in the system of Hatamoto/<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Gokenin.html">Gokenin</a> (direct vassals of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> and vassals of the shogunate, respectively). That is to say, the Banshu system was incorporated into the valet and guard posts such as Shoinban (castle guards), <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Sojaban (an official in charge of the ceremonies).html">Sojaban</a> (an official in charge of ceremonies), and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Tsukaiban.html">Tsukaiban</a> (a person responsible for order and patrol in the battlefield). </p>
