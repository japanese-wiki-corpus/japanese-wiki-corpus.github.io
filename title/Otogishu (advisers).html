<h1>Otogishu (advisers) (御伽衆)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Otogishu is the official duties, which existed in families of Sengoku <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> (Japanese territorial lords in the Sengoku period) from the the Sengoku period (period of Warring States) to the early Edo period. </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>Otogishu were the close advisers who were called to their lord's side and gave advice about politics and military affair, while they also reported buhenbanashi (anecdotes about the life of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a>) or situation of various districts to their lord. Otogishu was also known as Ohanashi-shu (collocutor of the load), Gohobanshu (officials who accompany <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>) and the brains. </p>
<p>In the the Sengoku period, otogishu was more likely to be a counselor, therefore, people like Buddhist priest, chief retainer who retired and withdrew to the sidelines, downfallen <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> (Japanese feudal lord) and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Busho.html">busho</a> (Japanese military commander) in the form of a Buddhist priest served as otogishu. After the turbulent age died down, the role of comforting lord's boredom also became to be emphasized, and townspeople who rose suddenly and became innovative power were also called to the lord's presence as otogishu and became new culture bearers at the time of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI.html">Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI</a>. After <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Edo Period.html">Edo Period</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> and territorial lords still had otogishu, however, as political power passed into the hands of chief retainers, power of otogishu had gradually weakened. </p>
<p>It is said that their storytelling spread among the common people and became the origins of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Kodan (storytelling).html">kodan</a> storytelling and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Rakugo (Japanese Traditional Comic Storytelling, or the Comic Story Itself).html">rakugo</a> (traditional comic storytelling). <h3>Hediyoshi and Otogishu</h3>
</p>
<p>As <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI.html">Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI</a> was not very good at reading and writing, in order to make up for that he had many otogishu for learning by the ear. According to one theory, he had 800 otogishu. And also, many otogishu of Hideyoshi came from a good line such as the old <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a> family, the family of former his master, or higher ranking <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Busho.html">busho</a> (Japanese military commander) than him. It is said that Hedeyoshi appointed those people as otogishu to show that the man like him from low-class now rose to the highest rank (possible for the subject) in a country and even people of good birth and people from historic families served him. </p>
<p>Hideyoshi's otogishu from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> family include <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshiaki ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshiaki ASHIKAGA</a>, Nobukatsu ODA, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Nagamasu ODA.html">Nagamasu ODA</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Narimasa SASSA.html">Narimasa SASSA</a>, Toyokuni YAMAYA, Keijhun MIYABE, Katsutoshi TAKIGAWA, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Shigenari FURUTA.html">Shigenari FURUTA</a> and Nagachika KANAMORI. Those from townspeople include <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/SEN no Rikyu.html">SEN no Rikyu</a>, Sokun IMAI and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Shinzaemon SORORI.html">Shinzaemon SORORI</a>. </p>
<p>They supported the reign of Hideyoshi at domestic affairs and gave rise to magnificent Momoyama Culture, while they formed a part of later <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Japanese Culture.html">Japanese Culture</a>, such as completion of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Wabicha (wabi style of tea ceremony).html">wabicha</a> (wabi style of tea ceremony) that pursued simplicity. </p>
