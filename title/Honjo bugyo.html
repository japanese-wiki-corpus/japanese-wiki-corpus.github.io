<p></p>
<p><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Honjo (proprietor or guarantor of manor).html">Honjo</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Bugyo.html">bugyo</a> was one of the positions of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Edo bakufu.html">Edo bakufu</a>. It controlled <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Honjo (proprietor or guarantor of manor).html">Honjo</a> (presently Honko in Sumida Ward) and Fukagawa (Koto Ward). The fixed number of people was 2 consisting of one each from shoinban (the castle guards) and koshoban (page). They managed civil administration, roads, bridges and waterways of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Honjo (proprietor or guarantor of manor).html">Honjo</a> and farmed out cleaning of water and sewerage, repair of water pipes and opening and closing of water pipe gate to citizens. </p>
<p>After the Great Fire of Meireki, Ryogoku-bashi Bridge was constructed across <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Sumida-gawa River (Noh play).html">Sumida-gawa River</a> and the construction of waterways for Kake-gawa River (in Tokyo) and Oyoko-gawa River was in progress and urban area was expanded to the west side of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Sumida-gawa River (Noh play).html">Sumida-gawa River</a> where was not included in Edo before. 
<br/>To respond to the situation, on May 4, 1660, Shigemasa TOKUYAMA and Shigemasa YAMAZAKI from shoinban (the castle guards) were assigned to '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Bugyo.html">bugyo</a> of waterways for <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Honjo (proprietor or guarantor of manor).html">honjo</a> residential land.'<br/>
This is considered as the beginning of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Honjo (proprietor or guarantor of manor).html">honjo</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Bugyo.html">bugyo</a>. </p>
<p>In 1685, it was abolished once, but on September 15 and 17 in 1693, it started again at the assignments of Yoshiaki TODO and Tsuneyuki TAGA. </p>
<p>After that, on June 3, 1713, residential area of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Honjo (proprietor or guarantor of manor).html">honjo</a> was transferred to machi <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Bugyo.html">bugyo</a> and on May 21, 1719, buke (military authority) area was transferred to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Fushin.html">fushin</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Bugyo.html">bugyo</a> (shogunate administrator of activities by a community, such as cleaning or fixing stone wall) and roads, bridges and waterways were transferred to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Kanjo.html">kanjo</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Bugyo.html">bugyo</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Honjo (proprietor or guarantor of manor).html">honjo</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Bugyo.html">bugyo</a> was abolished. General public administration and woks farmed out to citizens were managed by 'honjogata' (1 <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Yoriki (a governmental post in the Edo bakufu).html">yoriki</a> and 2 <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Doshin (patrol officer).html">doshin</a>) placed in machi <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Bugyo.html">bugyo</a>. </p>
