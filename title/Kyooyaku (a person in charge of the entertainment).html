<h1>Kyooyaku (a person in charge of the entertainment) (饗応役)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Edo bakufu.html">Edo bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>) established the post of 'Kyooyaku' during the Edo period to have someone provide entertainment for messengers of the emperor (who were known as "chokushi"), messengers of the retired emperor (who were known as "inshi"), or messengers of the empress (who were known as "nyoinshi") that had been sent to Edo. Mostly, tozama <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> (nonhereditary feudal lord) was appointed as kyooyaku. Kyooyaku was also called "gochisoyaku", "settaiyaku"or "kanbanyaku." It is known that ASANO Takumi no Kami, who was famous for Chushingura (The treasury of Loyal Retainers), served as kyooyaku for the imperial messenger when he had a sword fight with KIRA Kozuke no Suke. </p>
<p>On every New Year's Day, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Seii Taishogun.html">Seii Taishogun</a> (literally, "great general who subdues the barbarians") of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Edo bakufu.html">Edo bakufu</a> dispatched <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Hatamoto (direct retainers of shogun).html">hatamoto</a> (direct retainers of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>) called koke (privileged family under Tokugawa Shogunate) to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> to make New Year's greetings to the emperor and the retired emperor. In response, the emperor and the retired emperor dispatched their messengers to Edo for a return visit from the end of February to mid-March. This was an annual event in the Edo period. Messengers of the emperor or the retired emperor who visited Edo stayed at the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>'s special residence for imperial messengers, where Kyooyaku entertained them, presented expensive gifts to them, improved the interior of the places where they visited and kept their company. </p>
<p>In many cases, tozama <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> who was a lord of a castle with territory of 40,000 to 70,000 koku became Kyooyaku for messengers of the emperor, while tozama <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Jinya.html">jinya</a> (regional government office) with territory of 10,000 to 30,000 koku became Kyooyaku for those of the retired emperor. As entertaining the messengers of the emperor or the retired emperor cost a huge amount of money, the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Edo bakufu.html">Edo bakufu</a> appointed only tozama <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> as Kyooyaku to prevent them from saving extra money. However, to prevent boorish <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a>, who served in the position alone, from behaving in an impolite manner toward messengers of the emperor or the retired emperor, there was a rule that Koke-kimoiri (a kind of mentor for nobles who was familiar with manners and rules of etiquette that had to be observed for members of the Imperial Court) served as an instructor (or an adviser) for Kyooyaku <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a>. Kyooyaku <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> also had to give expensive gifts to koke as instruction fees. According to "Tokugawa Jikki" (collection of official records of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Edo bakufu.html">Edo bakufu</a>), it was 1632 when a series of custom (imperial messengers leave the capital and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> entertain them) was established. </p>
<p>And except this event, as messengers of the emperor or the retired emperor were sent to Edo and/or <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Nikko.html">Nikko</a> when needed, Kyooyaku was selected each time. </p>
