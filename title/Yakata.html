<p></p>
<p>Yakata means a mansion of exalted personage such as kuge (court nobles) and buke (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> families). Under the reign of the Muromachi <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>) and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Edo bakufu.html">Edo bakufu</a>, it also meant a title or a honorific title allowed to a head of any distinguished family or of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> family who was credited with his achievements. 
<br/>This is also called yakata-go (a title given to a yakata.)<br/>
</p>
<p>It was around the beginning of Muromachi period that the system of giving yakata-go title was established, when the title was allowed to Ashikaga clans and other predominant <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shugo daimyo.html">Shugo daimyo</a> (Japanese territorial lords as provincial constable) and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugodai.html">Shugodai</a> (deputies of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a>, provincial constables) as well as to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kokujin.html">Kokujin</a> (local <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a>) who were credited with their contribution to the establishment of Muromachi <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> and punitive expedition of rebellion. The synonims for yakata are yakatamono (a person who lives in a yakata,) yakatabune (a roofed pleasure boat) and so on. </p>
<p><h3>Before the Establishment of the Yakata-go Titling System</h3>
</p>
<p>The word 'yakata' is written either '屋形' or '館' in kanji (Chinese characters), but no difference existed between their meanings, since '屋形' is believed to have meant simply a residence, judging from the address of Yakata, Yokoshibahikari Town, Sanbu District, Chiba Prefecture, where <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/TAIRA no Takamochi.html">TAIRA no Takamochi</a> had set up an office for governmental affairs and let his son <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/TAIRA no Yoshikane.html">TAIRA no Yoshikane</a> reside, as well as the current use of the word of 'yakatabune' (a roofed pleasure boat). </p>
<p>Before the Heian period, the term 'shiro' (castle) meant 'saku' (a barrier) or 'toride' (a fort), but not a residence. Subsequently, along with the rise of buke (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> families), their 'shiro' with strategical advantages became important also as their residences, and the original meaning of 'yakata' had changed to become virtually nominal. <h3>Social Status of Yakata-go Title</h3>
</p>
<p>In the society of buke, 'tono' and 'tonosama' were generally used as the mainstream honorific titles for a lord. But, after establishment of the Muromachi <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>, another compellation 'oyakatasama' became commonly used for <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> (a Japanese territorial lord) who was awarded yakata-go by the Ashikaga <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> family, while some of their senior vassals with yakata-go were called 'oyakata' or 'yakata' for short. 
<br/>Such <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> were also respectfully called 'uesama.'<br/>
While a legal wife of a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> holding a title of yakata-go was referred to as 'urakatasama' or 'gotaiho,' his legitimate son was respectfully called 'shin-yakatasama' or 'uesama' in large part. </p>
<p>In the beginning, only <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> had the right to license a title of yakata-go to various <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a>, but later <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Mitsukane ASHIKAGA.html">Mitsukane ASHIKAGA</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> kubo (Governor-general of the Kanto region,) began licensing it to the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> in Kanto region and arranged a system of Kanto-hachi-yakata (Eight Yakata in the Kanto) which eventually paved a road to the establishment of a licensing system executed by both <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> kubo. </p>
<p>Also under the reign of Muromachi <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>, the yakata-go titles were conferred to such families as of the Ashikaga clan who were treated with higher status than <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a> (provincial constables,) and also to the prominent <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a> families who had successively been engaged in important posts of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> government or who were credited with some great achievements, as well to kokujin-ryoshu (local <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> lords) credited with their contribution to the establishment of Muromachi <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>. </p>
<p>For example, Kaneyori SHIBA from an illegitimate family of the Shiba clan which belonged to the Ashikaga clan, received a title of yakata-go and accordingly named himself as Mogami yakata so that he is regarded as the founder of the Mogami clan.. Another example is a member of the Odachi clan, a senior vassal of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> government, who referred to himself as Sekioka yakata after he was given a title of yakata-go when he became adopted by his wife's family, Kitabatake clan, who was <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a> of Ise Province and an owner of gosho (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a>'s palace). Among kokujin-ryoshu, Miya clan, who served as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>'s <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Hokoshu.html">hokoshu</a> (a military post in the Muromachi Shogunate,) was appointed as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a> of Bicchu Province and awarded with the title of yakata-go, in 1364. In 1438, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshinori ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshinori ASHIKAGA</a> conferred a yakata-go title to the Masuda clan, who was a prominent local <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> in Iwami Province, for their achievements in quelling rebellions and riots in the Kinai region. Also, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshitane ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshitane ASHIKAGA</a> allowed Taneshige CHIBA, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kokujin.html">kokujin</a> ryoshu of Hizen Province, to hold a yakata-go title, meanwhile soke (the head family) of Chiba clan was also holding one of kanto-hachi-yakata. Judging from these facts so far, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kokujin.html">kokujin</a> ryoshu were considered as eligible to receive yakata-go titles. However, we must acknowledge that any of these recipients of yakata-go title during the Muromachi period, like Miya clan of Bingo Province, Masuda clan of Iwami Province or Chiba clan of Hizen Province, were either provisionally appointed as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a> or were in fact a dominant <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> family comparable to an influencial position of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kokujin.html">kokujin</a> ryoshu. </p>
<p>For reference, what the word 'yakata' indicated was merely the family of the title holder, and, therefore, it was regarded as irreverent to use the title as honorific title of the head of the other families. Any <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> authorized to hold a yakata-go title was allowed to have his retainers wear <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Eboshi (Japanese traditional formal headwear).html">eboshi</a> (a lacquered hat), <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Hitatare.html">hitatare</a> (a kind of court dress in old days) and suo (formal middle rank dress, usually includeing jacket and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Hakama (pleated and divided skirt made in fine strips).html">hakama</a>). </p>
<p>No matter whether being titled or not, any <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> being allowed to hold a yakata-go title was authorized to bear shirokasabukuro (a white umbrella cover), mosenkuraoi (a tufted saddle cover), nurikoshi (a lacquard litter) and saihai (a baton of command) by the Muromachi <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>. Ashikaga <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> renshi (brothers and sisters of Ashikaga <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>,) <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kanrei.html">kanrei</a> (shogunal deputies,) and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Tandai.html">tandai</a> (local military commissioners) were privileged to endorse licenses for yakata-go titles in order to abbreviate autographies. </p>
<p>During the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Sengoku Period (period of warring states) (Japan).html">Sengoku Period</a> (Period of Warring Satets) in Japan, Tamekage NAGAO, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugodai.html">shugodai</a> (a deputy of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a>) of Echigo Province, was granted the use of a character from the real name of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>, Yoshiharu Ashikaga for a part of the name of his legitimate son, Harukage NAGAO, which was a custom of henki (granting subordinates the use of a character from the real name of the superior,) due to his dedication to the expenses of the emperor's coronation and building of the Imperial Palace and his donation to the Muromachi <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> as well, while Tamekage was authorized to identify himself as a holder of yakata-go title and to bear shirokasabukuro and mosenkuraoi, which meant that he was on an equal footing with <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a>. 
<br/>(Any one ranked as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugodai.html">shugodai</a> was usually authorized to bear karakasabukuro (a bag for oiled paper umbrella) along with mosenkuraoi and nurigoshi.)<br/>
</p>
<p>After the downfall of the Muromachi <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>, rulers of the whole country used the yakata-go titles for giving preferential treatment to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a>, as in the case of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Nobunaga ODA.html">Nobunaga ODA</a> who authorized the Daihoji clan to hold a title of yakata-go since, as recorded, he had conferred the title on Yoshiuji DAIHOJI in response to his presentation of a falcon to Nobunaga, though Yoshiuji was reportedly so rude that he was called mal-yakata since then. Subsequently, during the Edo period, kakubetsu gosho (a special title of gosho) was allowed to the Kitsuregawa clan, who was regarded as a descendant of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> families of the Muromachi <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>, while yakata-go titles were licensed to the others such as gosanke (three privileged branches of Tokugawa family) of Owari Clan, Kishu Clan and Mito Clan, and other prominent <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/family/Shinpan (Tokugawas relatives).html">shinpan</a> (relatives of the Tokugawa family), as well as kyuzoku <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> (feudal lords with ancestral status of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a> from the Muromachi period) including Shimazu clan of the Satsuma Clan, Satake clan of the Akita Clan and Uesugi clan of the Yonezawa Clan. <h3>Kanto-hachi-yakata</h3>
</p>
<p>By <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Mitsukane ASHIKAGA.html">Mitsukane ASHIKAGA</a>, who was <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> kubo, yakata-go titles were awarded to various dominant <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a> in the Kanto region. Among the yakata-go holders, specially privileged were the so called Kanto-hachi-yakata, also called Kanto-hachike (eight families of the Kanto region,) indicating Yuki clan, Oyama clan, Chiba clan, Satake clan, Nasu clan, Hatta clan (or Oda clan,) Utsunomiya clan and Naganuma clan (or Minagawa clan,) details of which are to be referred to the Kanto-hachi-yakata. <h3>An anecdote about yakata-go in the "Hojo Genan Oboegaki"</h3>
</p>
<p>When a daughter of Ujiyasu HOJO, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Busho.html">busho</a> (a Japanese military commander) in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Sengoku Period (period of warring states) (Japan).html">Sengoku Period</a>, was marrying Ujitomo KIRA who was an adopted son of Yoriyasu HOJO, Ujiyasu's granduncle, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Genan HOJO.html">Genan HOJO</a>, wrote a letter to the Ujiyasu's daughter in which he taught her in detail about family traditions and formalities of the Kira clan, daily manners and preparedness necessary for her to remain a lawful wife in the Kira family, and so on. 
<br/>In his letter, Genan taught her that she should respectfully call her father in law, Yoriyasu KIRA, 'Oyakatasama,' and her mother in law 'Otaiho,' as well as her husband 'Uesama.'<br/>
