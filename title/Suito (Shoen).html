They were in charge of accounting work, such as tax collection, keeping financial records, and computation of land tax, under the instruction of geshi/gesu (local officials in charge of a manor) and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kumon (official document).html">kumon</a> (local <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> officials below the geshi in rank). </p>
<p>According to the record in "Todaiji Yoroku" (the record of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Todai-ji Temple.html">Todai-ji Temple</a>), the treasurer was set up in the Toyoinosho in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yamato Province.html">Yamato Province</a> and Omotosho in Kii Province, where <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Todai-ji Temple.html">Todai-ji Temple</a> had its <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shoen.html">Shoen</a> manors. According to "Zatsuji Yoroku" (the record of miscellaneous things), which records the financial affairs of the Konoe family in the Muromachi Period, it is recorded that in the Obanryo parcel set up within the territory of the Sessho Kanpaku (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Regent.html">regent</a> and chief advisor to the Emperor) family, there was a post of treasurer to collect rice for a land tax called Oban-mai, and among the officers in charge of it, there were those who did business as wholesale merchants. </p>
