<h1>Juichii (従一位)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>"Juichii (Junior First Rank)" is a rank in court ranks and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinkai.html">shinkai</a> (ranks granted to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> gods) in Japan. It ranks below <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shoichii.html">Shoichii</a> (Senior First Rank) and above <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shonii.html">Shonii</a> (Senior Second Rank). </p>
<p>Summary<br/>
Under the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ritsuryo.html">Ritsuryo</a> system (a system of centralized government based on the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ritsuryo.html">ritsuryo</a> code), it was the highest rank granted to a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Queen (of imperial family).html">queen</a> and her female retainers. Many <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daijo-daijin (Grand minister of state).html">Daijo-daijin</a> (Grand minister of state) (officials corresponding to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shoichii.html">Shoichii</a> or Juichii) and kanpaku (chief advisor to the Emperor), which are <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Ryoge no kan (class outside of the Ritsuryo system).html">Ryoge no kan</a> (class outside of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ritsuryo.html">Ritsuryo</a> system), normally not included in the hierarchy of court ranks, were granted Juichii or <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shoichii.html">Shoichii</a>. </p>
<p>Additionally, later when <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kugyo.html">kugyo</a> (court noble) who could not serve as ministers were promoted to Juichii, it became a common practice that they were granted Jun-daijin (Vice Minister) by imperial proclamation. </p>
<p>In the Edo period, when seii taishogun (literally, "great general who subdues the barbarians") retired as ogosho and then granted <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daijo-daijin (Grand minister of state).html">Daijo-daijin</a>, he were promoted to Juichii. Additionally, the rank was granted to the birth mother of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>. An example is <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Keishoin.html">Keishoin</a>, the mother of the fifth <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Tsunayoshi TOKUGAWA.html">Tsunayoshi TOKUGAWA</a>, and her title of honor was 'Ichii-sama' after being promoted to Juichii. </p>
<p>In the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period, promotions to Juichii increased compared to the Edo period. Juichii corresponded to the first rank granted to Dukes, and those with a title of Duke or lower could be promoted to Juichii depending on their age. </p>
<p>There are no cases of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shoichii.html">Shoichii</a> granted after World War II, thus, today it is virtually the highest rank as a court rank of honor. The investiture is performed by the Emperor. In kunto (Order of Merit), it corresponds to Daikuni (highest possible order of merit). For example, Prime Ministers who made distinguished achievements are granted Juichii posthumously. </p>
