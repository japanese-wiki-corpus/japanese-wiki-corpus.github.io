<h1>Omuraji (ancient Japan) (大連 (古代日本))</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Omuraji is one of the governmental posts of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yamato.html">Yamato</a> sovereignty (the ancient Japan sovereignty) during the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kofun period (tumulus period).html">Kofun period</a> (tumulus period). Leading daifu (master), who followed the sovereignty, omuraji administered as the assistant of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Okimi (great king) (Yamato sovereignty).html">okimi</a> (emperor). Among the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Muraji.html">muraji</a>, one of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kabane (hereditary title).html">kabane</a> (hereditary titles), the Otomo clan and the Mononobe clan, the most powerful clans who managed the military affairs and served as the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Tomonomiyatsuko (the chief of various departments at the Imperial Court).html">Tomonomiyatsuko</a> (the chief of various departments at the Imperial Court), became omuraji. </p>
<p>Mononobenotochine's name is recorded as the first omi in "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Nihonshoki (Chronicles of Japan).html">Nihonshoki</a>" (the Chronicles of Japan), however, as it was the time of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Suinin.html">Emperor Suinin</a>, its existence is suspected. </p>
<p>An omuraji was appointed each time when a new <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Okimi (great king) (Yamato sovereignty).html">okimi</a> came to throne; at the time of Emperor Yuryaoku, when both <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/OTOMO no Muroya.html">OTOMO no Muroya</a> and MONONOBE no Me were assigned the position of omuraji, this poistion became a regular one together with oomi; in the early sixth century during the time of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Buretsu (Muretsu).html">Emperor Buretsu</a>, OTOMO no Kanemura and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MONONOBE no Arakahi.html">MONONOBE no Arakahi</a> were both appointed as omuraji; particularly, OTOMO no Kanemura, who made great achievements, exerted its power for a long time. When <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MONONOBE no Arakahi.html">MONONOBE no Arakahi</a> died at the time of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Senka.html">Emperor Senka</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MONONOBE no Okoshi.html">MONONOBE no Okoshi</a>, who was the male cousin of his father, was appointed as omuraji. However, after <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/OTOMO no Kanamura.html">OTOMO no Kanamura</a>, who failed in the management of Korean Peninsula, was forced to resign due to the denouncement of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MONONOBE no Okoshi.html">MONONOBE no Okoshi</a>, the position of omuraji was only assumed by the Mononobe clan. In the late sixth century, which was the time of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Bidatsu.html">Emperor Bidatsu</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Yomei.html">Emperor Yomei</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/MONONOBE no Moriya.html">MONONOBE no Moriya</a>, a son of Okoshi, was appointed as omuraji. However, after the death of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Yomei.html">Emperor Yomei</a>, the Mononobe clan was destroyed by a search-and-destroy unit of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Okimi (great king) (Yamato sovereignty).html">okimi</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/SOGA no Umako.html">SOGA no Umako</a> after having conflicts over the matter of accepting Buddhism and succession to the Imperial Throne; since then, the system of omuraji was abolished and Oomi of the Soga clan took the real power of the Imperial Court. </p>
