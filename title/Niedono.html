<h1>Niedono (贄殿)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Niedono was an institution attached to Naizenshi (Imperial Table Office) under the Ritsuryo system (a system of centralized government based on the ritsuryo code) of Ritsuryo Japan. This was Ryoge no kan (class outside of the Ritsuryo system). </p>
<p>Niedono stored and managed local specialties of each region presented to the emperor from provinces as nie (foods presented to the emperor). Betto (the superintendent) and azukari (an additional post to the chief of Naizenshi) worked as the officials. </p>
