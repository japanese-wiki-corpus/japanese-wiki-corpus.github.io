<h1>Tozama <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">Daimyo</a> (nonhereditary feudal lord) (外様大名)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Tozama <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> was a class of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> in Edo period defined according to ancestry. </p>
<p>Summary<br/>
The term 'tozama' originally indicated a vassal whose relationship with the lord was not tight. </p>
<p>Tozama <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> were not involved in the household management within their master's house, and responded instead to the master upon notification of military mobilization or the like. Tozama <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> could irreprehensively secede from vassalage after the fall of the master's house. </p>
<p>Tozama <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> were <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> who were incorporated into the ruling system of the TOKUGAWA clan before and after the Battle of Sekigahara. </p>
<p>Many of tozama <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> ruled large domains, however, they were basically not stationed in the vicinity of the locations of strategic importance including Kanto region with Edo in the center, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, Osaka and those along the Tokaido Road. In the early Edo period, the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Edo bakufu.html">Edo bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>) was wary of tozama <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a>, and condemned them for minor deficiencies, which often resulted in sanction called <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kaieki.html">kaieki</a>: sudden dismissal and deprivation of position, privileges and properties. </p>
<p>Tozama <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> were generally not appointed to key positions among the cabinet officials of the shogunate such as roju, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Apart (Apartment).html">apart</a> from some exceptions including the SO clan of Tsushima Province, who had traditionally played a significant role in diplomatic relations with Korea, and the SANADA and MATSUMAE clans, who were appointed key positions in the late Edo period. The other such exceptional tozama <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> included the TODO clan, who served as the TOKUGAWA clan's spearhead and was, in the military, ranked as high as the II clan of the Fudai Hitto (Principal fudai <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a>), and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Terumasa IKEDA.html">Terumasa IKEDA</a> was ranked as high as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/family/Shinpan (Tokugawas relatives).html">shinpan</a> (TOKUGAWA's relatives) and was once expected to serve as the Commander-in-Chief in the Sieges of Ozaka. </p>
<p>In addition, there is a theory that the TOKUGAWA shogunate distinguished between pre-Sekigahara tozama <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> such as IKEDA, KURODA and HOSOKAWA clans who had maintained close relationship with TOKUGAWA clan well before, and post-Sekigahara tozama <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> such as MORI, SHIMAZU and UESUGI clans who had submitted themselves to the TOKUGAWA clan's rule after the Battle of Sekigahara, so as to treat the two parties differently. </p>
<p>Incidentally, some tozama <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a>, who were the TOKUGAWA clan's blood relatives or persons of high achievement, were treated equivalently to fudai <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a>, and were also conveniently called jun-fudai <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> (quasi fudai <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a>). </p>
