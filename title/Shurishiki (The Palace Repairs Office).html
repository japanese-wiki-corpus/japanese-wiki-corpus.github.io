<h1>Shurishiki (The Palace Repairs Office) (修理職)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Shurishiki (also known as Surishiki) refers to a Ryoge no kan (class outside of the Ritsuryo system) established in the Heian period. 
<br/>Its Japanese name was 'Wosame (or Osame) tsukuru tsukasa.'<br/>
</p>
<p><h3>Official duties and history</h3>
</p>
<p>The main duty was the repair and construction of Daidairi (the Greater Imperial Palace). </p>
<p>Since clerical work of Moku-ryo (Bureau of Carpentry) in charge of construction and architecture under the Ritsuryo system (ancient East Asian system of centralized governance in Japan: esp. 7th-10th century) was complicated, work of Zogushiki (Office of Works) which was merged once was delinked, and Shurishiki was newly established as Ryoge no kan in 818 in the period of Emperor Saga. In 826, Shurishiki was abolished by a merger with Moku-ryo. In 890, Shurishiki was revived and established. </p>
