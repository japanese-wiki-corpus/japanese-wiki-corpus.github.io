<p></p>
<p>The term sengoku <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> refers to a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> who exercised unitary control over several districts or provinces during Japan's sengoku (warring states) period. </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>Compared with <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> (Japanese territorial lord as provincial constable) in the Muromachi period, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> in the sengoku period centralized control of territories, which were not under the influence of the central government. In particular, sengoku <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> strengthened their control over <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Hikan (low ranking clerks).html">hikan</a> (low-level bureaucrats) and kashin (vassals), and established the kandakasei system, a system for imposing military duties in return for <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Chigyo.html">chigyo</a> daka (a stipend based on a fief's rice production). Some <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> in the period established <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bunkokuho.html">bunkokuho</a> (the laws to be enforced in their own territories) to mediate disputes between <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Hikan (low ranking clerks).html">hikan</a> and vassals or among residents in their territories. The highly independent and solid territory control system employed by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> in the sengoku period is called the daimyo-ryogoku system. It is said that the control style of this system was reached by increasing the level of central control in the shugo-ryogoku system (the system in which a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a> controlled a province). </p>
<p>Many <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> in the sengoku period were appointed to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a> by the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>) to establish their own legitimacy so as to surpass adjacent <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a>. Based on this, some people view sengoku <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> as being sengoku-period <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a>. In order to legitimize their control or gain an advantage over neighboring <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a>, many sengoku <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> gave substantial donations to the Imperial Court in return for an official title (these titles reserved for <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> were known as buke kani). In this situation, the authority of Emperor, having been on the brink of ruin, came to be recognized again. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/The Emperor (Tenno).html">The Emperor</a> at the time played no small role in unifying the entire nation around the end of the sengoku period to the Azuchi-Momoyama period. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">Daimyo</a> in the sengoku period advanced the level of independent control over their territories significantly, which decentralized control of the nation. However, the unification of the nation by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Nobunaga ODA.html">Nobunaga ODA</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI.html">Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI</a> brought the nation under centralized control, making activities by sengoku period <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> less independent. Under these circumstances, sengoku <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> made the transition to being early-modern <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> in the shogunate system. <h3>Origins</h3>
</p>
<p>The origins of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> in the sengoku period are roughly as follows:<br/>
Many sengoku <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> were originally <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> (such as the Satake, Inagawa, Takeda, Toki, Rokkaku, Ouchi, Otomo and Shimazu clans), while many others were originally <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugodai.html">shugodai</a> (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a> deputies) or their vassals/retainers (such as the Asakura, Amago, Nagao, Miyoshi, Chosokabe, Jinbo, Hatano, Oda and Mastunaga clans). There were also many who were originally local lords or religious powers (such as the Mori, Tamura, Ryozoji and Tsutsui clans). Additionally, there were also many sengoku <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> who were originally <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> officers or ronin (masterless <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a>), such as the Gohojo and Saito clans). There were some who were originally <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kokushi.html">kokushi</a> (like the Uesugi or Kitabatake clans, who held both <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kanrei.html">kanrei</a> (shogunal deputy) positions) and others who were originally court royals (such as the Tosaichijo clan). <h3>Control</h3>
</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> in the sengoku period was completely in control of his territory. Being highly independent, each of these territories could be called a regional nation. A <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> in the sengoku period organized persons in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kokujin.html">kokujin</a> (local <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a>) or <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Hikan (low ranking clerks).html">hikan</a> (low-level bureaucrats) class as his vassals and made them live around his base place to form a castle town. In this way, the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> dissolved or weakened the relations of power between the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kokujin.html">kokujin</a>/<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Hikan (low ranking clerks).html">hikan</a> class and the land/general populace. As well as imposing military duties on the local populace in exchange for maintaining order, the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> also established a new taxation system after carrying out a land survey. Some <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> established <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bunkokuho.html">bunkokuho</a> as a base for mediating disputes among persons in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kokujin.html">kokujin</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Hikan (low ranking clerks).html">hikan</a> classes and other disputes in their territories. This territory control system employed by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> in the sengoku period is called the daimyo-ryogoku system. </p>
<p>However, the authority of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> in the sengoku period was not always unlimited. Power of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> in the sengoku period was based on the persons in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kokujin.html">kokujin</a> or <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Hikan (low ranking clerks).html">hikan</a> class who were organized as his vassals. The uprisings that spread across Japanese society during the Muromachi period also spread to the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kokujin.html">kokujin</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Hikan (low ranking clerks).html">hikan</a> classes. Therefore, persons in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kokujin.html">kokujin</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Hikan (low ranking clerks).html">hikan</a> classes established an alliance to form a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kokujin.html">kokujin</a> uprising in order to retain their rights. The existence of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> in the sengoku period was supported by the uprising-based relationships formed by persons in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kokujin.html">kokujin</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Hikan (low ranking clerks).html">hikan</a> classes. Some <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> who couldn't protect the interests of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kokujin.html">kokujin</a>/<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Hikan (low ranking clerks).html">hikan</a> classes were removed from power, a situation which was known as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Gekokujo.html">gekokujo</a> (people of lower standing overthrowing their social superiors). </p>
