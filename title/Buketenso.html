<h1>Buketenso (武家伝奏)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Buketenso was one of the job titles within the Imperial Court from Muromachi to the Edo period. The purpose was to transmit petitions of the samurai families to the Emperor. Court nobles were appointed to the job. It was set up during the Kenmu Restoration, and was institutionalized by the Muromachi bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun). </p>
<p>During the Muromachi period, the buketenso handled communications between the court nobles and samurai, giving notice of changes in the name of an era, and appointment of a rank. Since Yoshimitsu ASHIKAGA had become shogun, buketenso played a role of transmitting the political requirements from the Muromachi-dono, or the shogun, to the Court. The function of the buketenso was established after the Eisho era in the Sengoku Period (Period of Warring States) (Japan). </p>
<p>During the Edo period, two people, the fixed number of positions were appointed by the bakufu and given 250 hyo as an executive allowance and some money or textiles as a salary. Under the control of the Edo bakufu, it was set up in 1603 and lasted to the end of the Edo period in 1867. </p>
<p>Under the control of the Edo bakufu, a court noble of the dainagon (Major Counselor) class, who was an academically superior and eloquent speaker, was appointed to the job and requested by the Kyoto shoshidai (the Kyoto deputy) to present a paper sealed in blood. The buketenso was appointed as the Imperial envoy to the bakufu. As the bakufu actively intervened into the governing affairs of the Imperial Court, which became administered by mutual consent amongst the Sekkan family (line of regents and advisers), the giso (position conveying what the congress decides to the emperor), and the buketenso. It was abolished in accordance with the Order of Imperial restoration. </p>
