<h1>Shobanshu (相伴衆)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Shobanshu was a status indicating a position in the Muromachi <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>). They were the ones who followed the lead of the Seii taishogun (literally, "great general who subdues the barbarians") and went together with him when he attended a banquet at the palace or visited somebody else's home. As they were limited to the family of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kanrei.html">kanrei</a> (deputy to the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>) and the influential <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a>, became a valuable social status, also reflected in the office organization inside the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>, were given the order of precedence after the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kanrei.html">kanrei</a>. </p>
<p>The custom of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> following Seii taishogun's lead was established around the era of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshimitsu ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshimitsu ASHIKAGA</a>, but it is estimated that Shobanshu as a status and position was established during the era of Eikyo of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshinori ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshinori ASHIKAGA</a>. </p>
<p>However, during the period of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Sengoku Period (period of warring states) (Japan).html">Sengoku Period</a> (Period of Warring States) (Japan) the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Appointment (Ninkan).html">appointment</a> of more local warlords who were not from the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a>, who did not follow the Seii taishogun's lead by staying in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> such as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Takakage ASAKURA (the seventh head of the family).html">Takakage ASAKURA</a> (the 10th family head) and Ujiyasu HOJO increased, and the meaning as a position was diluted and continued to exist only as a formal title representing the status of a feudal lord. Moreover, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Nagayoshi MIYOSHI.html">Nagayoshi MIYOSHI</a>, who was originally a vassal of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/family/Hosokawa clan.html">Hosokawa clan</a>, was appointed as Shobanshu by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshiteru ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshiteru ASHIKAGA</a> and, using the authority of this status, assumed control over the shogunate administration acting in the position of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kanrei.html">kanrei</a>. </p>
