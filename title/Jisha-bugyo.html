<p>Jisha-bugyo was one of the shogunate administrators in military government from the Muromachi to Edo eras, and was in charge of temples and shrines. </p>
<p><h3><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> and Muromachi <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>)</h3>
</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>), officials who were in charge of temples and shrines were called "Jisha-bugyo." Other <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Bugyo.html">bugyo</a> were set up to negotiate and mediate with certain strong temples and shrines. According to the Chronicle of Azuma, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/NAKAHARA no Suetoki.html">NAKAHARA no Suetoki</a> was appointed to deal with requests from temples and shrines in May, 1194 (lunar calendar), and is considered to be the origin of Jisha-bugyo. In December, 1194 (lunar calendar), Kageyoshi OBA and others were appointed as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Bugyo.html">bugyo</a> in charge of temples and shrines supported by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>, such as Tsurugaoka Hachiman-gu Shrine and Shochoju-in Temple. Later, while <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Tokitsura OTA.html">Tokitsura OTA</a> and Sadao NIKAIDO were appointed as Jisha-bugyo, other <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Bugyo.html">bugyo</a> were appointed respectively for temples and shrines under the aegis of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>, such as Suwa-taisha Shrine, Izusan-jinja Shrine, Mishima-taisha Shrine and Atsuta-jingu Shrine. </p>
<p>This policy was continued by the Kenmu Government and the Muromachi <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>. In the Muromachi <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>, Jisha-bugyo was subdivided into Temple-bugyo (in charge of Buddhist temples) and Shake-bugyo (in charge of shrines). Furthermore, additional <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Bugyo.html">bugyo</a>, who were in charge of certain religious schools, strong temples and shrines, were appointed as Zenritsugata (commissioners for Zen and Ritsu monasteries), <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Sanmon (large triple gate to temple).html">Sanmon</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Bugyo.html">bugyo</a> (the Enryaku-ji magistrate) and Nanto <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Bugyo.html">bugyo</a> (the magistrate of Todai-ji and Kofuku-ji Temples). After <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshimitsu ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshimitsu ASHIKAGA</a>, special <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Bugyo.html">bugyo</a> were appointed proactively as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Bugyo.html">bugyo</a> in charge of special temples and shrines, by the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Bugyoshu (group of magistrates).html">bugyoshu</a> (group of magistrates). 
<br/>As the special <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Bugyo.html">bugyo</a> were in a position between the special strong temples and shrines and the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>, they were often bribed by the temples or on the other hand they extorted the temples and shrines. (example: Confrontation between <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Enryaku-ji Temple.html">Enryaku-ji Temple</a> and Tametane INOO who was <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Sanmon (large triple gate to temple).html">Sanmon</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Bugyo.html">bugyo</a> under <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshinori ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshinori ASHIKAGA</a>)<br/>
These special <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Bugyo.html">bugyo</a> were at the height of their power in the reign of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshimasa ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshimasa ASHIKAGA</a>, then went into decline along with the fall of the Muromachi <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> after the Onin war. </p>
<p>Jisha-bugyo and special <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Bugyo.html">bugyo</a> were set up in the local administrative organs such as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Rokuhara Tandai (an administrative and judicial agency in Rokuhara, Kyoto).html">Rokuhara Tandai</a>, Oshu Shogunfu and Kamakura Government. <h3>Edo bakufu(Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>)</h3>
</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Edo bakufu.html">Edo bakufu</a>, Suden ISHIN and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Katsushige ITAKURA.html">Katsushige ITAKURA</a> were in charge of the affairs of temples and shrines in 1612, although they had no specific positions. (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Suden.html">Suden</a> was a priest and Katsushige returned to secular life)<br/>
<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Suden.html">Suden</a> worked full-time on the affairs of temples and shrines alone after <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Katsushige ITAKURA.html">Katsushige ITAKURA</a>'s death. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Suden.html">Suden</a> died in 1633, during the reign of Shogun Iemitsu, therefore, subsequently no one was in charge of the affairs of temples and shrines. Therefore, a post to deal with litigation related to temples, shrines and local provinces far from the capital was established in 1635. At first, this post was under the direct control of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a>, then the Roju system (member of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>'s council of elders) was established and the roju controlled the post. However, it came under the direct control of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> again in 1662 during the reign of Shogun Ietsuna. </p>
<p>In principle, fudai <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> (daimyo as hereditary vassal to the Tokugawa family) with more than 10,000 koku were appointed to Jisha-bugyo, simultaneously serving as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Sojaban (an official in charge of the ceremonies).html">Sojaban</a> (officials in charge of ceremonies). 
<br/>[It was an exception that Tadasuke OOKA, who was <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Hatamoto (direct retainers of shogun).html">Hatamoto</a> (direct retainer of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>), achieved the rank of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> and became Edo <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Machi-bugyo (town magistrate).html">machi-bugyo</a> (town magistrate of Edo) without serving as a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Sojaban (an official in charge of the ceremonies).html">Sojaban</a>.]<br/>
Among the three magistrates (Jisha-bugyo, Kanjo-bugyo, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Machi-bugyo (town magistrate).html">Machi-bugyo</a>), Jisha-bugyo was the top-ranked, because Kanjo-bugyo and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Machi-bugyo (town magistrate).html">Machi-bugyo</a> were under the control of roju. The fixed number of places was about four, and their offices were in their residences. They worked on a monthly rotating schedule. </p>
<p>Being a member of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Hyojosho (conference chamber).html">Hyojosho</a> (conference chamber) as well as Kanjo-bugyo and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Machi-bugyo (town magistrate).html">Machi-bugyo</a>, Jisha-bugyo was in charge of litigation regarding not only temples and shrines, but also many territories, except for Kanhasshu (the Eight Provinces of the Kanto region). The main task was to control temples, shrines and their priests. In addition, the Jisha-bugyo controlled temple town citizens, people in the domains of temples and shrines, folk religious leaders such as ascetic Buddhist monks and philosophers, and artists such as poets. As temples and shrines controlled the family registration of common people at that time, the role of Jisha-bugyo, which managed litigation and family registration, was similar to the present Ministry of Justice. <h3>Reference</h3>
</p>
<p>In period dramas, tharey are often scenes where <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Doshin (patrol officer).html">doshin</a> (police constable) and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Yoriki (a governmental post in the Edo bakufu).html">yoriki</a> (police sergeant) of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Machi-bugyo (town magistrate).html">Machi-bugyo</a> are annoyed at a criminal who has escaped into the grounds of a temple or shrine, because these territories were under the control of Jisha-bugyo. But this is not based on fact. When a criminal entered the territory of a temple or shrine, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Machi-bugyo (town magistrate).html">Machi-bugyo</a> applied, using certain procedures, to the Jisha-bugyo to handover and/or capture the criminal. Hitsuke tozoku aratame-kata (literally, "investigative division for arson and organized robbery) could investigate or capture the criminals within the domain of a temple oｒ a shrine without Jisha-bugyo's prior approval. When a temple or a shrine protected a criminal, Jisha-bugyo investigated it strictly and sometimes took the priests into custody. Therefore, a temple or a shrine was not immune from the law. </p>
