<h1>Emonfu (Headquarters of the Outer Palace Gate Guard) (衛門府)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Emonfu was a government office under the Ritsuryo system (a system of centralized government based on the Ritsuryo Code). Originally there was only the Emonfu, but it was temporarily abolished in 808 due to its integration with Eshifu (whose functions were the same as those of Emonfu); then in 811, Emonfu was restored along with the renaming of Sayu Eshifu (left and right division of the outer palace gate guard), and.Saemonfu (left division of outer palace gate guard) and Uemonfu (right division of outer palace guard) were positioned there. The head of Emonfu was called "Emon no kami" (later Saemon no kami (captain of the left division of outer palace gate guard) and Uemon no kami (captain of the right division of outer palace gate guard). Emonfu was also called 'Yugehi no tsukasa' in the Japanese way by using the kanji character for 'yugei' (gate guard). 
<br/>Its Chinese names were Kingo (according to a theory, the name was derived from a bird which was said to keep out ominous events),<br/>
Kanmon (gate guard),<br/>
and Kanfu (guard division). </p>
<p>In the beginning Emonfu was called 'Goefu' (five guards) along with the Sayu (left and right) Eshifu and Sayu Hyoe-fu (division of the middle palace gate guard); after restoration, it was called 'Rokuefu' (six guards) along with the Sayu Konoefu (division of the inner palace guard) and the Sayu Hyoe-fu. For the purpose of convenience, Emonfu before integration is described as 'the former period,' and Emonfu after being renamed is described as 'the latter period' in this article. </p>
<p><h3>The former period</h3>
</p>
<p>Also positioned was Eshi, with a core of the Monbu (gate division), which carried on the yugei traditions. As the role of guarding the kyujo gate (place where the Emperor lives) was continuously assumed by a clan from ancient times, the post was named Emonfu ("e" meaning "to guard," "mon" meaning "gate," and "fu" meaning "division"). Emonfu's official duties were to guard the Miya-mon Gate and interrogate passersbys. The post was renamed Shimone in 758 (the Emperor Junnin) as a part of trend towards Chinese style official names by FUJIWARA no Nakamaro, but in 764 (the Emperor Shotoku) the post was again renamed Emonfu after the downfall of FUJIWARA no Nakamaro. The post was merged into Sayu Eshifu on July 22, 808, and with this Sayu Eshifu was standardized. </p>

<br/>Just for the record, the guardroom of the left Emon (gate guard) was at the Kenshun Gate;<br/>
the guardroom of the right Emon was at the Gishu Gate, respectively. Originally the Office of Police and Judicial Chief was placed within Emonfu as an additional post of Emonfu government officials. It was common for the Uemon no kami (captain of the right division of outer palace guards) to double as Kebiishi no betto (superintendent of the Imperial Police). </p>
