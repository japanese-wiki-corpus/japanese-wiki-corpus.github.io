<h1>Jushii (従四位)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>"Jushii" (Junior Fourth Rank) is a rank in court ranks and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Shinto/Shinkai.html">shinkai</a> (ranks granted to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> gods) in Japan. </p>
<p>It ranks below <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shoshii (Senior Fourth Rank).html">Shoshii</a> (Senior Fourth Rank) and above <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogoi.html">Shogoi</a> (Senior Fifth Rank). In case of posthumous honor, it is called Zojushii (posthumous Jushii). </p>
<p>Jushii<br/>
<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shoshii (Senior Fourth Rank).html">Shoshii</a> was divided into Upper and Lower under the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Ritsuryo.html">Ritsuryo</a> system (a system of centralized government based on the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Ritsuryo.html">ritsuryo</a> code), and it ranked below <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Jusanmi.html">Jusanmi</a> (Junior Third Rank) and above Jushii (Junior Fourth Rank). Under the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Ritsuryo.html">Ritsuryo</a> system, it was divided into Jushiinojo (Junior Fourth Rank, Upper Grade) and Jushiinoge (Junior Fourth Rank, Lower Grade). In kunto (Order of Merit), it corresponds to Kunyonto (Fourth Class of Order), and Kami (director) and Suke (assistant director) of government officials in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> such as Sakyo no daibu (Master of the Eastern Capital Offices) and Ukyo no daibu (Master of the Western Capital Offices) who perform administration in the Imperial Court corresponded to this court rank. </p>
<p>The title of honor for those ranked Jushiinoge or higher and Shoshiinojo (Senior Fourth Rank, Upper Grade), and who were not listed as <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Kugyo.html">kugyo</a> (court noble) was basically Nanori Ason, in which Ason (second highest of the eight hereditary titles) was added under their family names or imina (real name). 
<br/>For example, 'Hosokawa Ukyo no daibu Jushiinoge MINAMOTO no Katsumoto Ason.'<br/>
</p>
<p>Under the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Ritsuryo.html">Ritsuryo</a> system where Sanmi or higher was considered <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Kugyo.html">kugyo</a>, many of the collateral family members of the Fujiwara clan and non-Fujiwara clan middle class nobles held the court rank, Shii. When the starting rank was Jugoinoge (Junior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade) and the highest rank was <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shoshii (Senior Fourth Rank).html">Shoshii</a> for the leading <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a>, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Seiwa-Genji (Minamoto clan).html">Seiwa-Genji</a> (Minamoto clan) and Kanmu Heishi (Taira clan), even those in the lineage of eldest son were not promoted unless there were some deeds of arms. </p>
<p>However, in the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period, since the Hojo clan, who gained power since the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>) was established and succeeded in exterminating their political enemies, seized <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shikken (regent for the shogun).html">shikken</a> (<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Regent.html">regent</a> for <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>) posts in the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>, those in the lineage of eldest son in the Hojo clan began being promoted to Shoshiinojo, and Hojo clan members and powerful <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Gokenin.html">gokenin</a> (an immediate vassal of the shogunate in the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> and Muromachi through Edo periods) were promoted to court ranks such as Jushiinoge. Furthermore, from the Muromachi period onward, it was granted to dominant <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Shugo daimyo.html">Shugo daimyo</a> (Japanese territorial lord as provincial constable). In particular, the Ashikaga clan, who served as sankanrei <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shishiki.html">shishiki</a> (three families assigned as assistants of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> and four families serving as director of samurai-dokoro (Board of Retainers)), and dominant <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a> (provincial constable), or noble <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a> families were granted the Jushiinoge. </p>
<p>Additionally, in the Ashikaga <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> family, court ranks such as Gon <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Dainagon (chief councilor of state).html">Dainagon</a> (provisional major counselor), which were equivalent to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Kugyo.html">kugyo</a>, were the starting ranks, but in the late Muromachi period, conflict occurred within the Ashikaga <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> family over who would succeed as <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>, and the 13th <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a>, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Yoshiteru ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshiteru ASHIKAGA</a>, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Yoshiaki ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshiaki ASHIKAGA</a>, etc., became seii taishogun (literally, "great general who subdues the barbarians") as Jushiinoge, and there were cases where they were listed as <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Kugyo.html">kugyo</a> while being Jushii, without becoming <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shoshii (Senior Fourth Rank).html">Shoshii</a>. </p>
<p>In the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Sengoku Period (period of warring states) (Japan).html">Sengoku Period</a> (Period of Warring States), the Miyoshi clan, who were a vassal of sankanrei <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/family/Hosokawa clan.html">Hosokawa clan</a> and a family of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shugodai.html">Shugodai</a> (deputy of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a>, provincial constable), were listed as <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shobanshu.html">Shobanshu</a> (officials who accompany the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a>) of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> and were granted Jushiinoge, and this led to their vassal, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Hisahide MATSUNAGA.html">Hisahide MATSUNAGA</a>, also being promoted to Jushiinoge like his master family, and appointments were made according to real abilities rather than parentage or social status. </p>
<p>When <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI.html">Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI</a> conquered the country as a successor to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Nobunaga ODA.html">Nobunaga ODA</a>, who overthrew the Muromachi <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>, but died a violent death with the conquering of the country in sight, Hideyoshi advanced to kanpaku (chief advisor to the Emperor), while chief vassals such as <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Ieyasu TOKUGAWA.html">Ieyasu TOKUGAWA</a> and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Toshiie MAEDA.html">Toshiie MAEDA</a> were granted Nii (Second Rank) and Sanmi (Third Rank), and Jushii began being issued as court ranks for their legitimate children and chief vassals. </p>
<p>Additionally, when Ieyasu established the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Edo bakufu.html">Edo bakufu</a>, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Kamon (family).html">kamon</a> <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> (feudal lords who are relatives of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>, but neither sanke (three families of the Tokugawas) nor sankyo (three Tokugawa clan families who separated from the clan)) and fudai <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> (a <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> in hereditary vassal to the Tokugawa family) who held executive positions such as roju (member of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>'s council of elders, koke (privileged family under Tokugawa Shogunate), tozama <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> (nonhereditary feudal lord) who were <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> of 100,000 koku or more, were granted this court rank. </p>
<p>In the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period, Jushii corresponded to the first court rank granted to a <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Baron.html">baron</a> in the title for nobility, and in the army and navy, it corresponded to lieutenant general. </p>
<p>Currently, the court rank is issued to the deceased who made achievements, and is granted to government workers who made achievements, university professors with achievements in performing arts, cultural activities, academic research, etc. </p>
