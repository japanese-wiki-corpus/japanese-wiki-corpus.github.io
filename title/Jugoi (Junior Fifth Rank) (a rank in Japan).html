<h1>Jugoi (Junior Fifth Rank) (a rank in Japan) (従五位)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The term "Jugoi" (Junior Fifth Rank) refers to an Ikai (court rank) or a <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Shinto/Shinkai.html">Shinkai</a> (ranks granted to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> gods) in Japan. It ranks below <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogoi.html">Shogoi</a> (Senior Fifth Rank), above <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shorokui.html">Shorokui</a> (Senior Sixth Rank). If it was conferred posthumously, it is referred to as Zo Jugoi (Jugoi conferred posthumously). Those who belonged to Jugoinoge (Junior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade) or a higher rank were regarded as nobles in the Japanese court rank system before the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period. Jugoi was conferred on an eldest legitimate son of the peerage. Therefore, it was also used as a different name for an eldest legitimate son of the peerage. </p>
<p><h3>Before and in the Edo period</h3>
</p>
<p>Goi (Fifth Rank) was a rank corresponding to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Kokushi.html">Kokushi</a> (provincial governor), Chinjufu <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> (Commander-in-Chief of the Defense of the North) and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shodaibu (aristocracy lower than Kugyo).html">Shodaibu</a> (aristocracy lower than <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Kugyo.html">Kugyo</a>) in the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Ritsuryo.html">ritsuryo</a> system. Those who belonged to Jugoinoge or a higher rank were called 'Tsuki' (通貴), and those who belonged to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Jusanmi.html">Jusanmi</a> (Junior Third Rank) or a higher rank were called 'Ki' (貴). For this reason, Goi (Fifth Rank) and higher ranks were regarded as ranks for so-called <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Kizoku (nobles).html">Kizoku</a> (nobles) written in kanji (Chinese characters) "貴族" (The first kanji "貴" meaning "nobility" was also used in the above-mentioned terms "Tsuki" [通貴] and "Ki" [貴].). Goi was divided into senior and junior subdivisions, each of which was further divided into upper and lower grades. Accordingly, Goi ranged from Jugoinoge (Junior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade) to Shogoinojo (Senior Fifth Rank, Upper Grade). Thus it may be said that it was necessary for nobles in the Heian period to belong to Jugoinoge or a higher rank. </p>
<p>While another name of Jugoinoge was <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Eishaku (an honorable position or rank).html">Eishaku</a> (the title of honorable position or honorable noble class), those who belonged to this rank were referred to as Daibu (Master). The first Qin Emperor in China conferred the rank of Daibu, which corresponded to Jugoi in Japan, on a pine tree. For this reason, Jugoi corresponding to Daibu was also referred to as Shoshaku (松爵) (literally, "peerage of a pine tree"). Therefore, conferring Jugoinoge was referred to as Joshaku (conferring a peerage). </p>
<p>Those who belonged to Jugoinoge were mainly members of branches of the Fujiwara clan who served as <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Kokushi.html">Kokushi</a> for generations, members of the Tachibana, Takashina and other clans, members of Seiwa Genji (Minamoto clan) and Kanmu Heishi (Taira clan) that belonged to the military aristocracy. This rank was conferred on many middle-class nobles including the above-mentioned clan members. </p>
<p>This rank was conferred on nobles of the middle and lower ranks in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, riryo (government official) who went to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> under the regime of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>), members of the Minamoto clan, and influential <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Gokenin.html">gokenin</a> (an immediate vassal of the shogunate in the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> and Muromachi through Edo periods) from a family of pedigree, until the early <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period. In the Muromachi period, it was also an Ikai conferred on members of Ashikaga Shogun Family or <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a> (provincial constable) as the first investiture. This rank was also conferred on many <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a>, powerful <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Kokujin.html">Kokujin</a> (local <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a>) and others. </p>
<p>Jugoinoge was conferred on all branches that came from the lineage of a prestigious family and had few enfeoffments, all fudai <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> (a <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> in hereditary vassal to the Tokugawa family), all tozama <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> (nonhereditary feudal lord) having <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Kokudaka (The Figure Of Land Productivity).html">Kokudaka</a> (assessed yield) under 100,000 Koku (approximately 18 million liters of crop yield) in their territory, and all <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Hatamoto (direct retainers of shogun).html">hatamoto</a> (direct retainers of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>) of high rank in the Edo period. It was conferred mainly on <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> (Japanese feudal lord), powerful <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Hatamoto (direct retainers of shogun).html">hatamoto</a>, gosanke (three privileged branches of Tokugawa Family), gosankyo (three branches of Tokugawa family, which was established by the eighth <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Yoshimune TOKUGAWA.html">Yoshimune TOKUGAWA</a>), the Honda clan serving as Karo (chief retainer) of the Fukui Domain ruled by Tokugawa's relatives of the highest rank or the Kaga Domain, and the Kikkawa clan, a branch family of the Choshu clan, at the time when the Kikkawa clan was allowed to found the Iwakuni Domain. Although the court rank of Jugoi was conferred on the Honda clan from the Kaga Domain, the corresponding post was not given to it. Therefore, members of the clan were called 'Jugoi sama' or 'Jugoi dono' (Both terms mean literally "Mr. Jugoi."). <h3>In and after the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period</h3>
</p>
<p>Jugoi had been automatically conferred on an eldest legitimate son of the peerage since the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period. For this reason, an eldest legitimate son of the peerage was also referred to as Jugoi. This rank was also conferred on Lieutenant Colonels and others. </p>
<p>At present, it is to be conferred on the deceased as a mark of honor. It is conferred on the deceased who rendered distinguished service as chairperson of a prefectural assembly, head of a school, chief of police, fire chief, chief of a fire company or president of a company. </p>
