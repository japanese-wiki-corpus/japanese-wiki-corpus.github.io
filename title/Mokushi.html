<h1>Mokushi (牧士)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Mokushi was a govermental post in the Edo period which was in charge of maintaining ranches under direct control of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>, as subordinates of an officer in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>, and it is said that the officers in the post were responsible for managing the Goyoboku of the Tokugawa <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (public ranches of horses + hunting grounds for <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a>). Although each of the officers was a farmer, he was permitted to ride on a horse, to own his family name and to wear a sword, being the highest-positioned person of farmers. Because there were many ranches in the northen part of Chiba Prefecture, lots of information aboutMOkushi is available there. </p>
