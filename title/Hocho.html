<h1>Hocho (保長)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>A hocho was a headman of goho (the end administrative organization obliged to prevent crime and pay tax jointly) established under the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ritsuryo.html">ritsuryo</a> system (a system of centralized government based on the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ritsuryo.html">ritsuryo</a> code [historical law system]) in the ancient Japan. </p>
<p>According to the Code of Households, goho (ho) consisted of five households and performed mutual surveillance to prevent crime and escape, and the hocho was in charge of the goho. </p>
<p>At first the goho was the system for the agricultural community in the county, however, in the Heian period, each bo (a unit of administrative district in the Heian period) was divided into four ho (a unit of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Jobosei (a city plan where streets were laidout in a grid pattern).html">jobosei</a> [a series of avenues running at right angles to each other]) and, moreover, each ho was composed of four cho (a unit of distance) in Heiankyo (ancient capital in current <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>). In 862, each ho within Heiankyo was organized, and a hocho was selected from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Keishi (household superintendent).html">keishi</a> (household superintendent) of koshin (Emperor's family) and nobles to protect the security of ho. </p>
