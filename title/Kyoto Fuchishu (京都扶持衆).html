<h1>Kyoto Fuchishu (京都扶持衆) (京都扶持衆)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The Kyoto Fuchishu were <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> warriors who established master-subordinate relationships with the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Seii Taishogun.html">Seii Taishogun</a> (literally, "great general who subdues the barbarians") of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Muromachi Bakufu.html">Muromachi Bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>) in the Muromachi Period in the Kanto (currently, Tokyo and six other prefectures) and Tohoku (north of the Kanto region) regions. It is also called Kyoto Onfuchishu (京都御扶持衆). </p>
<p>In the Muromachi Period, the Kanto region was ruled by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kamakura Kubo.html">Kamakura Kubo</a>, who was the representative of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Seii Taishogun.html">Seii Taishogun</a> and acted in the role as head of the Kamakura-fu. The Kanto region was put under the indirect rule of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>. The <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kamakura Kubo.html">Kamakura Kubo</a> was gradually confronting the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> and finally came to desire the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> post. To put a stop to these actions by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kamakura Kubo.html">Kamakura Kubo</a>, the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> formed master-subordinate relationships directly with influential <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> warriors who were opposed to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kamakura Kubo.html">Kamakura Kubo</a> in the Kanto and Ou area. </p>
<p>These <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> warriors were called Kyoto Fuchishu (according to the records of the time, Kyoto Onfuchishu.)<br/>
Although they were <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> warriors from a province under the jurisdiction of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kamakura Bakufu.html">Kamakura Bakufu</a>, they were not obliged to go and serve the Kamakura-fu and were put under the direct direction/control of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>, and were not directed by the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kamakura Kubo.html">Kamakura Kubo</a>. The <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> formed the Kyoto Fuchishu and proceeded with anti-Kamakura Kubo activities. It is believed that there were more than a dozen Kyoto Fuchishu <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> families during the reign of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshimochi ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshimochi ASHIKAGA</a>. The <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Muromachi Bakufu.html">Muromachi Bakufu</a> superficially criticized the activities of the Fuchishu, whilst at the same time actually providing mental and material support. </p>
<p>Individuals who actually became Kyoto Fuchishu were of the Takeda clan of Kai Province, the Yamairi clan, Oguri clan, Makabe clan and Daijo clan of Hitachi Province, the Utsunomiya clan, Nasu clan and Onodera clan of Shimotsuke Province and the Sasagawa Palace, Date clan, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ashina clan.html">Ashina clan</a>, Nanbu clan and Shirakawa Yuki clan of Mutsu Province. </p>
<p>When Zenshu UESUGI, former <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kanrei.html">kanrei</a> of Kanto (a deputy to the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> in the Kanto region) attacked <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Mochiuji ASHIKAGA.html">Mochiuji ASHIKAGA</a> (a warlord in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a>) in the War of Zenshu UESUGI, these clans supported <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Zenshu.html">Zenshu</a> or maintained a neutral stance, ignoring Yoshimochi's order to put down <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Zenshu.html">Zenshu</a>. Moｒeover, though Yoshimochi issued the order of subjugation, Yoshimochi implicitly approved these acts in order to weaken Mochiuji's influential power. When Mochiuji learnt this, he killed Mitsushige OGURI to scare the Kyoto Fuchushu (War of Mitsushige OGURI). Yoshimochi aggressively suggested it as being a 'personal war', which led to asking Sankanrei (three deputies), <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Tokihiro YAMANA.html">Tokihiro YAMANA</a> and Mitsusuke AKAMATSU about whether the killing Mochiuji would be right or wrong. Finally, the disturbance was cleared up with Mochiuji`s apology. </p>
<p>However, while the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> was trying to prevent Mochiuji from strengthening his influential power using the warrior Kyoto Fuchishu as an intermediary, Mochiuji was attempting to put them down, and such continued confrontations became a cause that lead to Eikyo no Ran (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Eikyo War.html">Eikyo War</a>). After the fall of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kamakura Kubo.html">Kamakura Kubo</a> in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Eikyo War.html">Eikyo War</a>, the Yamanouchi-Uesugi family, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kanrei.html">kanrei</a> of Kanto, who were sympathizers of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>, seized power to control Kanto, so it is believed that the warrior Kanto Fuchishu disappeared naturally. </p>
