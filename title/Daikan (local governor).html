<h1>Daikan (local governor) (代官)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>A daikan (local governor) meant a person, who performed the public administration and construction in a designated territory on behalf of his monarch (state), and his rank. Daikan became one of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> government's posts in Japan. </p>
<p>A local governor enforcing the king's will in western countries was sometimes translated into Japanese as a daikan, and in many cases,he was a villain like the one in stories such as William Tell or Robin Hood, being possibly effected by Japanese period dramas. </p>
<p>Daikan before the Edo period. </p>
<p>After the medieval period in Japan, there were many deputy posts like azukaridokorodai (acting deputy <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> lord; <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> was a manor), <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kokushi.html">kokushi</a> no <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Mokudai.html">mokudai</a> (deputy kokuhsi; <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kokushi.html">kokushi</a> was a provincial governor mostly before the Muromachi period), <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugodai.html">shugodai</a> (deputy <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a>: shugo was a military governor), koshugodai (acting deputy military governor), jitodai (deputy jito; jito was a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> steward), and jindai whose function was to preside troops on a campaign as a deputy, and furthermore, there existed a deputy post of these deputies called matadai (literally, "double deputy"). </p>
<p>Originally, the concept of daikan represented a deputy post which administered political affairs and ruling in koryo (government's territory) or shoryo (private territory). Before the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> government came into power, a typical sample of the post was <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Mokudai.html">mokudai</a> acting as deputy of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kokushi.html">kokushi</a>. After the Heian period, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Yonin (steward).html">yonin</a> system (remote appointments), which <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kokushi.html">kokushi</a> did not reside in his appointed province but his deputy attended the governance of the province on his behalf, was established, and it became popular for <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kokushi.html">kokushi</a> who adopted this system to set up the deputy post called <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Mokudai.html">mokudai</a> (deputy <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kokushi.html">kokushi</a>) in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kokufu.html">kokufu</a> (provincial office). </p>
<p>After the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period, with the establishment of a power structure concerning land ruling based on <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a> jito system (system to govern provinces by military governors and their estate stewards) in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> government, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Gokenin.html">gokenin</a> (immediate vassals of the shogunate) who were assigned multiple <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a> posts in several provinces came to privately appoint <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugodai.html">shugodai</a> (deputy <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a>), who performed the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a> role on behalf of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a>. In the Muromachi period, the administrators of lands under direct control of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (the shogunate) were called daikan, and they were distinguished from <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugodai.html">shugodai</a> who performed the deputy role of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a>, and from koshugodai who were deputies of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugodai.html">shugodai</a> (See <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugodai.html">Shugodai</a> for details). </p>
<p>In a broad sense, as explained above, the post of daikan extensively meant a deputy post, whose role was to perform duties in an appointed province like the post of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Mokudai.html">mokudai</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugodai.html">shugodai</a>; but after the Muromachi period, daikan post came to mean, originally, a post which attended the rulings of lands under direct control of the Muromachi <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Muromachi shogunate) on behalf of it, and later in the Sengoku period (period of warring states), <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> (Japanese territorial lord) followed this practice and appointed their own daikan in lands under their direct control, thus the name of daikan came to represent whole posts who had the name. </p>
<p>After the Azuchi-Momoyama Period in particular, as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Nobunaga ODA.html">Nobunaga ODA</a> forced his vassals of his clan to live in his castle town without exception, which resulted in a rapid increase in demesnes without their lords residing there, thus it became a practice to let daikan administer their demesnes including new chigyo-chi(territory). </p>
<p><h3>Daikan in the Edo period</h3>
</p>
<p>In the Edo period, daikan as well as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Gundai.html">gundai</a> (daikan administering relatively wide shogunal lands) were appointed by the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> under the control of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Kanjo.html">kanjo</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Bugyo.html">bugyo</a> (commissioner of finance), and they administered chigyo-chi of small sized <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Hatamoto (direct retainers of shogun).html">hatamoto</a> (direct retainers of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Edo bakufu.html">Edo bakufu</a>) and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Tenryo (Shogunal Demesne).html">tenryo</a> (shogunal lands; the name <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Tenryo (Shogunal Demesne).html">tenryo</a> was used after <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> era). </p>
<p>Daikan in the early Edo period were mostly hereditary posts, and small sized <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Gozoku (local ruling family).html">gozoku</a> (local ruling families) and jizamurai (local <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a>) residing in the local lands were selected to be daikan and taken into the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> as retainers. Among the daikan, famous figures are Tarozaemon EGAWA of Nirayama daikan office, MIYAGAWA no Tomoyuki Sukezaemon of Matsuzaki daikan office, and Shigenari SUZUKI of Amakusa daikan office. With the increase of bureaucratic daikan, although their term was not fixed, they were mostly replaced within a few years after the Kanei era (1624 - 1644). The lands administered by daikan were generally said to be easier to live than in the other ones governed by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> (lord whose domains have at least 10,000 koku of rice [one koku equals 5.1 bushels]). It should be noted that the daikan had a different role from <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Sunpu.html">Sunpu</a> machi <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Bugyo.html">bugyo</a> (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Sunpu.html">Sunpu</a> town magistrate), Sado <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Bugyo.html">bugyo</a> (Sado mine magistrate), etc. </p>
<p>The status of daikan among <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Hatamoto (direct retainers of shogun).html">hatamoto</a> was the lowest with bestowed appanage of 150 bales (a bale is a traditional unit for rice, which is 60 kilograms) of rice, but his administering land was large and his power was big considering his status, which often resulted in making daikan's appearance as bad one in period dramas. Due to the above reasons, the bad image of daikan—oppressing peasants, receiving bribe from merchants, and ruling local women－has widely spread. Bosses and superiors who order irrational demand are sarcastically called odaikan sama (Mr. Daikan) today, which derives from the persistent images of the bad daikan in those dramas. Due to influence of these period dramas, people sometimes jocularly use the word, odaikan sama, when they beg somebody for something. </p>
<p>However, actually, the political system removed a daikan who was even slightly ill reputed without delay, so a bad daikan pursuing his personal greed could not exist for a long time in that society. As severe levy of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Nengu (Land Tax).html">nengu</a> (annual tribute) led to peasants' <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Chosan.html">chosan</a> (to abandon one's field and flee away to other districts to evade cruel taxes), which adversely decreased the amount of collected <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Nengu (Land Tax).html">nengu</a>. There were actually some daikan who were dismissed and punished due to their responsibility for people who died from starving at the time of famines. Basically, in fact, daikan were so busy that most of them could not even find time to think about the evil conducts as written above. However, according to a record, there seems to have been a rare daikan, who deserved to be called as an evil one, who collected 88% as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Nengu (Land Tax).html">nengu</a> in Harima Province, this rate was apparently an extortionate levy compared with the average rate 27.6% in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Tenryo (Shogunal Demesne).html">tenryo</a> (shogunal lands; the name <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Tenryo (Shogunal Demesne).html">tenryo</a> was used after <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> ear) during the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shotoku no chi (political reforms).html">Shotoku no chi</a> (the peaceful era of Shotoku). </p>
<p>The area under the daikan's control was several tens of thousands of koku, which was usually considered as one unit of his area. The daikan set up a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Jinya.html">jinya</a> (or called daikansho; regional office of administrative officials) in their jurisdictional area to administrate. Under the daikan, there were about 10 tetsuke (assistants of daikan but an immediate vassal of the shogunate; busi class) and a few tedai (assistants of daikan; servant for a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> family), who assisted him. Particularly, the daikan whose appointed lands were near Kanto area remained as Edo jofu (a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">Daimyo</a> feudal lord's retainer who remained permanently in the Edo with the lord's and their own family in the Edo period) and administered their lands through communicating with their tedai and went to their jurisdictional lands only on the occasion of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kenchi.html">kenchi</a> (land survey), kemi (annual crop inspection), junsatsu (inspection), and serious affairs. When the daikan's appointed lands were in remote places, zaichi (to reside in one's place) was the principle. </p>
<p>Resembling the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>, in many han (domains), as their vassals' appanage generally changed from <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Chigyo.html">chigyo</a> (grant) to kuramai (payment by rice from warehouses), <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Gundai.html">gundai</a> (intendant of a region or administrator of a town) and daikan who were appointed by their han came to administer vassals' territories together. </p>
<p>The status of daikan as a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bushi.html">bushi</a> was low in various han, many daikan were in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kachi.html">kachi</a> (foot guard) class with appanage of below 10 koku and also were inherited by local powerful families. In the latter case, their kakaku (family status) were mostly <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kachi.html">kachi</a> class in the han. </p>
<p>Furthermore, in outlands, local rich farmers were mostly appointed as daikan and no officials were sent. The rewards in this case were status privileges such as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Myojitaito.html">myojitaito</a> (the right to bear a surname and to wear a sword) and tax privileges such as tax exemption and permission to use utility mail system. <h3>Daikansho (daikan's administrative office)</h3>
</p>
<p>Daikansho was an administrative office, where a daikan was sent and performed administration, set up in the territory under the direct control of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Edo bakufu.html">Edo bakufu</a> such as shihaijo (bakufu-owned land) and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Tenryo (Shogunal Demesne).html">tenryo</a> in the Edo period. As the feudal system under the shogunate (bakuhan taisei system) had been completely established in the Edo period, the size of daikansho was rather small considering the size of the area which the daikan administrated. At the end of the Edo period, in Gojo daikansho (south <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Yamato.html">Yamato</a>; 70 thousand koku), there were only one daikan, three tetsuke who were vassals of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>, and ten personal tedai (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> class), although there were <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Ashigaru.html">ashigaru</a> (common foot solders) and chugen (chore men below common foot solders) in addition. When local powerful persons were appointed as daikan, their residences were used as daikansho without setting up exclusive ones, and the local people such as their family members and servants served as the officials of the daikan. </p>

<p>After the <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html&quot;>Kamakura</a> period, with the establishment of a power structure concerning land ruling based on <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html&quot;>shugo</a> jito system (system to govern provinces by military governors and their estate stewards) in the <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html&quot;>samurai</a> government, <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Gokenin.html&quot;>gokenin</a> (immediate vassals of the shogunate) who were assigned multiple <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html&quot;>shugo</a> posts in several provinces came to privately appoint <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugodai.html&quot;>shugodai</a> (deputy <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html&quot;>shugo</a>), who performed the <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html&quot;>shugo</a> role on behalf of <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html&quot;>shugo</a>. In the Muromachi period, the administrators of lands under direct control of <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html&quot;>bakufu</a> (the shogunate) were called daikan, and they were distinguished from <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugodai.html&quot;>shugodai</a> who performed the deputy role of <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html&quot;>shugo</a>, and from koshugodai who were deputies of <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugodai.html&quot;>shugodai</a> (See <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugodai.html&quot;>Shugodai</a> for details). </p>
<p>In a broad sense, as explained above, the post of daikan extensively meant a deputy post, whose role was to perform duties in an appointed province like the post of <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Mokudai.html&quot;>mokudai</a> and <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugodai.html&quot;>shugodai</a>; but after the Muromachi period, daikan post came to mean, originally, a post which attended the rulings of lands under direct control of the Muromachi <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html&quot;>bakufu</a> (Muromachi shogunate) on behalf of it, and later in the Sengoku period (period of warring states), <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html&quot;>daimyo</a> (Japanese territorial lord) followed this practice and appointed their own daikan in lands under their direct control, thus the name of daikan came to represent whole posts who had the name. </p>
<p>After the Azuchi-Momoyama Period in particular, as <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Nobunaga ODA.html&quot;>Nobunaga ODA</a> forced his vassals of his clan to live in his castle town without exception, which resulted in a rapid increase in demesnes without their lords residing there, thus it became a practice to let daikan administer their demesnes including new chigyo-chi(territory). </p>
<p><h3>Daikan in the Edo period</h3>
</p>
<p>In the Edo period, daikan as well as <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Gundai.html&quot;>gundai</a> (daikan administering relatively wide shogunal lands) were appointed by the <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html&quot;>bakufu</a> under the control of <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Kanjo.html&quot;>kanjo</a> <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Bugyo.html&quot;>bugyo</a> (commissioner of finance), and they administered chigyo-chi of small sized <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Hatamoto (direct retainers of shogun).html&quot;>hatamoto</a> (direct retainers of the <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Edo bakufu.html&quot;>Edo bakufu</a>) and <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Tenryo (Shogunal Demesne).html&quot;>tenryo</a> (shogunal lands; the name <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Tenryo (Shogunal Demesne).html&quot;>tenryo</a> was used after <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Meiji.html&quot;>Meiji</a> era). </p>
<p>Daikan in the early Edo period were mostly hereditary posts, and small sized <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Gozoku (local ruling family).html&quot;>gozoku</a> (local ruling families) and jizamurai (local <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html&quot;>samurai</a>) residing in the local lands were selected to be daikan and taken into the <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html&quot;>bakufu</a> as retainers. Among the daikan, famous figures are Tarozaemon EGAWA of Nirayama daikan office, MIYAGAWA no Tomoyuki Sukezaemon of Matsuzaki daikan office, and Shigenari SUZUKI of Amakusa daikan office. With the increase of bureaucratic daikan, although their term was not fixed, they were mostly replaced within a few years after the Kanei era (1624 - 1644). The lands administered by daikan were generally said to be easier to live than in the other ones governed by <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html&quot;>daimyo</a> (lord whose domains have at least 10,000 koku of rice [one koku equals 5.1 bushels]). It should be noted that the daikan had a different role from <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Sunpu.html&quot;>Sunpu</a> machi <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Bugyo.html&quot;>bugyo</a> (<a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Sunpu.html&quot;>Sunpu</a> town magistrate), Sado <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Bugyo.html&quot;>bugyo</a> (Sado mine magistrate), etc. </p>
<p>The status of daikan among <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Hatamoto (direct retainers of shogun).html&quot;>hatamoto</a> was the lowest with bestowed appanage of 150 bales (a bale is a traditional unit for rice, which is 60 kilograms) of rice, but his administering land was large and his power was big considering his status, which often resulted in making daikan's appearance as bad one in period dramas. Due to the above reasons, the bad image of daikan—oppressing peasants, receiving bribe from merchants, and ruling local women－has widely spread. Bosses and superiors who order irrational demand are sarcastically called odaikan sama (Mr. Daikan) today, which derives from the persistent images of the bad daikan in those dramas. Due to influence of these period dramas, people sometimes jocularly use the word, odaikan sama, when they beg somebody for something. </p>
<p>However, actually, the political system removed a daikan who was even slightly ill reputed without delay, so a bad daikan pursuing his personal greed could not exist for a long time in that society. As severe levy of <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Nengu (Land Tax).html&quot;>nengu</a> (annual tribute) led to peasants' <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Chosan.html&quot;>chosan</a> (to abandon one's field and flee away to other districts to evade cruel taxes), which adversely decreased the amount of collected <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Nengu (Land Tax).html&quot;>nengu</a>. There were actually some daikan who were dismissed and punished due to their responsibility for people who died from starving at the time of famines. Basically, in fact, daikan were so busy that most of them could not even find time to think about the evil conducts as written above. However, according to a record, there seems to have been a rare daikan, who deserved to be called as an evil one, who collected 88% as <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Nengu (Land Tax).html&quot;>nengu</a> in Harima Province, this rate was apparently an extortionate levy compared with the average rate 27.6% in <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Tenryo (Shogunal Demesne).html&quot;>tenryo</a> (shogunal lands; the name <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Tenryo (Shogunal Demesne).html&quot;>tenryo</a> was used after <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Meiji.html&quot;>Meiji</a> ear) during the <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shotoku no chi (political reforms).html&quot;>Shotoku no chi</a> (the peaceful era of Shotoku). </p>
<p>The area under the daikan's control was several tens of thousands of koku, which was usually considered as one unit of his area. The daikan set up a <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Jinya.html&quot;>jinya</a> (or called daikansho; regional office of administrative officials) in their jurisdictional area to administrate. Under the daikan, there were about 10 tetsuke (assistants of daikan but an immediate vassal of the shogunate; busi class) and a few tedai (assistants of daikan; servant for a <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html&quot;>samurai</a> family), who assisted him. Particularly, the daikan whose appointed lands were near Kanto area remained as Edo jofu (a <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html&quot;>Daimyo</a> feudal lord's retainer who remained permanently in the Edo with the lord's and their own family in the Edo period) and administered their lands through communicating with their tedai and went to their jurisdictional lands only on the occasion of <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kenchi.html&quot;>kenchi</a> (land survey), kemi (annual crop inspection), junsatsu (inspection), and serious affairs. When the daikan's appointed lands were in remote places, zaichi (to reside in one's place) was the principle. </p>
<p>Resembling the <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html&quot;>bakufu</a>, in many han (domains), as their vassals' appanage generally changed from <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Chigyo.html&quot;>chigyo</a> (grant) to kuramai (payment by rice from warehouses), <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Gundai.html&quot;>gundai</a> (intendant of a region or administrator of a town) and daikan who were appointed by their han came to administer vassals' territories together. </p>
<p>The status of daikan as a <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bushi.html&quot;>bushi</a> was low in various han, many daikan were in <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kachi.html&quot;>kachi</a> (foot guard) class with appanage of below 10 koku and also were inherited by local powerful families. In the latter case, their kakaku (family status) were mostly <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kachi.html&quot;>kachi</a> class in the han. </p>
<p>Furthermore, in outlands, local rich farmers were mostly appointed as daikan and no officials were sent. The rewards in this case were status privileges such as <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Myojitaito.html&quot;>myojitaito</a> (the right to bear a surname and to wear a sword) and tax privileges such as tax exemption and permission to use utility mail system. <h3>Daikansho (daikan's administrative office)</h3>
</p>
<p>Daikansho was an administrative office, where a daikan was sent and performed administration, set up in the territory under the direct control of the <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Edo bakufu.html&quot;>Edo bakufu</a> such as shihaijo (bakufu-owned land) and <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Tenryo (Shogunal Demesne).html&quot;>tenryo</a> in the Edo period. As the feudal system under the shogunate (bakuhan taisei system) had been completely established in the Edo period, the size of daikansho was rather small considering the size of the area which the daikan administrated. At the end of the Edo period, in Gojo daikansho (south <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Yamato.html&quot;>Yamato</a>; 70 thousand koku), there were only one daikan, three tetsuke who were vassals of the <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html&quot;>bakufu</a>, and ten personal tedai (<a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html&quot;>samurai</a> class), although there were <a href=&quot;https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Ashigaru.html&quot;>ashigaru</a> (common foot solders) and chugen (chore men below common foot solders) in addition. When local powerful persons were appointed as daikan, their residences were used as daikansho without setting up exclusive ones, and the local people such as their family members and servants served as the officials of the daikan. </p>
