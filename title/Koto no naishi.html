<h1>Koto no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Naishi.html">naishi</a> (勾当内侍)</h1>
<p>Koto no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Naishi.html">naishi</a> was a female court noble during the period of the Northern and Southern Courts (Japan). She was said to be the daughter of Tsunetada ICHIJO or Koremasa/Koretada ICHIJO, or the daughter or younger sister of Yukifusa ICHIJO. Her real name is not known. Although it is said that she was the wife of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshisada NITTA.html">Yoshisada NITTA</a> (his legally wedded wife was a daughter of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/family/Ando clan.html">Ando clan</a>), descriptions of her relationships with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshisada NITTA.html">Yoshisada NITTA</a> are included only in "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Taiheiki (Record of the Great Peace).html">Taiheiki</a>" (The Record of the Great Peace) and it is highly likely that they were imagenary, considering chronological estimates and others. It is also said that the existence of 'Koto no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Naishi.html">naishi</a>' herself is dubious. </p>
<p>Personalities<br/>
The reason why she became a wife of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshisada NITTA.html">Yoshisada NITTA</a> in Kozuke Province, who participated in Emperor Godaigo's activities for defeating the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>) and contributed to getting control of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a>, is said to be as follows: Emperor Godaigo who started the new government in the Kenmu era gave her to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshisada NITTA.html">Yoshisada NITTA</a> as a prize for his contribution. In 1336, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshisada NITTA.html">Yoshisada NITTA</a> defeated <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Takauji ASHIKAGA.html">Takauji ASHIKAGA</a>, who was alienated from the new government, in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> together with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Masashige KUSUNOKI.html">Masashige KUSUNOKI</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Akiie KITABATAKE.html">Akiie KITABATAKE</a>, and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Takauji ASHIKAGA.html">Takauji ASHIKAGA</a> and his followers fled to Kyushu. Although several reasons were considered for why <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshisada NITTA.html">Yoshisada NITTA</a> did not chase <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Takauji ASHIKAGA.html">Takauji ASHIKAGA</a>, "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Taiheiki (Record of the Great Peace).html">Taiheiki</a>" described the reason as follows: He was reluctant to leave Koto no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Naishi.html">naishi</a> in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, losing the timing to dispatch troops, and therefore, she was the woman who generated the cause of Yoshisada's fall. </p>
<p>Takauji entered <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and chased Emperor Godaigo, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshisada NITTA.html">Yoshisada NITTA</a> fled to the Hokuriku region with Imperial Prince Tsuneyoshi placed as Emperor and died in battle at Fujishima of the Echizen Province attacked by ASHIKAGA troops in 1338, and "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Taiheiki (Record of the Great Peace).html">Taiheiki</a>" makes a description of Koto no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Naishi.html">naishi</a> at around that time as in the following: Koto no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Naishi.html">naishi</a>, who parted from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshisada NITTA.html">Yoshisada NITTA</a> at Imakatata beside <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Lake Biwa.html">Lake Biwa</a> and spent days sadly in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, was invited by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshisada NITTA.html">Yoshisada NITTA</a> and started for Hokuriku, but at Somayama (present Najo Town, Fukui Prefecture), she knew that he had died in a battle and became a (female) priest seeing his head hung on a prison gate. It was also described that her father, Yoshifusa, followed <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshisada NITTA.html">Yoshisada NITTA</a> and also died in battle in Hokuriku. A legend also describes that Koto no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Naishi.html">naishi</a> entered the sea at the Kotogahama beach and died. </p>
<p>In Imakatata, there exists Nogami-jinja Shrine whose god is Koto no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Naishi.html">naishi</a> and there is a temple for her, Senpuku-ji Temple, and the Nogami festival was also held for consoling her spirit. In addition, after contents of "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Taiheiki (Record of the Great Peace).html">Taiheiki</a>" became well-known through performances of storytellers in the Edo period, graves of Koto no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Naishi.html">naishi</a> were built in various places. </p>
<p>It is also pointed out that some of Koto no naishi-tsubone"s (-tubone: a honorary suffix attachde to the name of a high-ranked female in the court) income came from Mikuniminato near to Fujishima where <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshisada NITTA.html">Yoshisada NITTA</a> died in a battle. </p>
<p>Her grave is located in Ojima-machi, Ota City, Gunma Prefecture (former Ojima Town, Nitta County)<br/>
