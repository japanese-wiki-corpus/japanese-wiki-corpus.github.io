<h1>Sanchuro (three mediators in Toyotomi Administration) (三中老)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Sanshuro, which literally means three high-ranking officials called Churo, were the posts established in the last days of the Toyotomi Administration, allowing those three men in the posts to participate in politics, and to mediate between Gotairo and Gobugyo when they cannot agree. They were also called Kotoshiyori. </p>
<p>Three of Chikamasa IKOMA, Yoshiharu HORIO, and Kazuuji NAKAMURA were appointed. Although 'Sanchuro' appears in some historical sources including 'Taikoki', it is unclear whether they really functioned or not; it is considered that they were placed temporarily, or placed as posts to give some authority to the three. </p>
