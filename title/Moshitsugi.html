<p>Moshitsugi (an official for conveying a message) which is also called Souja/Shosha, refers to a position in charge of reporting information to a lord, or refers to the act of reporting information itself. </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>In the Heian period, Moushitusgi referred to a person who was in charge of reporting information to the Emperor and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Daijo Tenno.html">Daijo Tenno</a> (the retired Emperor). At first, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Nyobo (a court lady).html">Nyobo</a> (a court lady) or Kinshin (close aide/trusted vassal) took the role of Moushitsugi, but in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Insei.html">Insei</a> period (during the period of the government by the retired Emperor), favorite retainers among <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/In no Kinshin (the retired Emperors courtier).html">In no Kinshin</a> (the retired Emperor's courtier) were working as Moushitsugi, including <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/TAKASHINA no Yasutsune.html">TAKASHINA no Yasutsune</a> at Goshirakawa-incho (the retired <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Goshirakawa.html">Emperor Goshirakawa</a>'s Office), and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Nobukiyo BOMON.html">Nobukiyo BOMON</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Kintsune SAIONJI.html">Kintsune SAIONJI</a> at Gotoba-in (the Retired Emperor Gotoba's Office); these people were involved in the government affairs through announcing <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Migyosho.html">Migyosho</a> (documents for informing of decisions made by third or upper ranked authorities). Later, Moushitusgi and Souja at the Imperial Court became called denso (a position to relay messages of court's people to Emperor), and from the end of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period to the early Muromachi period, positions such as Sanmon Denso (liaison officers between the imperial court and a temple), Nanto Denso (liaison officers between the imperial court and temples in Nara) and Buke Tenso (liaison officers between the imperial court and the military government) were created and were also in charge of issuing Hosho (a document for informing lower-rank people of the decision of upper people such as an emperor or <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>). Jinja Denso (liaison officers between the imperial court and temples) as well as Buke Tenso were continued until the Edo period. </p>
<p>In the Sekkan-ke (the families which produced the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Regent.html">Regent</a> and the Chief Adviser to the Emperor), <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Nyobo (a court lady).html">Nyobo</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Keishi (household superintendent).html">Keishi</a> (household superintendent) took the role of Moushitsugi, and this custom was inherited by the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> families in the military governments. Aside from this, a position called <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kanto moshitsugi.html">Kanto moshitsugi</a> (court-appointed liaison with the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>) was created in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>). Kanto Moshitsugi reported the requests from the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> and negotiated with the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> regarding the important government affairs, together with Moshitsugi. Later, the Saionji family was, by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Heredity.html">heredity</a>, appointed to Kanto Moshitsugi, and they gained a greater voice than the Sekkan families in the Imperial Court. In the Muromachi <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>, the families who mediated for Seii taishogun (literally, "great general who subdues the barbarians"), were limited to several specific families called <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Moshitsugishu.html">Moshitsugishu</a> (a civil servant post in Muromachi Shogunate). Also, other than Sekkan families, Moushitsugi was placed at <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Monzeki (Monseki).html">Monzeki</a> (temples formerly led by founder of sect, temples in which resided a member of nobility or imperial family) and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Gozan (a term relating to Zen temples).html">Gozan</a> (Zen temples highly ranked by the government). In the Sekkan families, Moshitsugi was appointed to Tenjobito (a high-ranking courtier allowed into the Imperial Palace) who served as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Keishi (household superintendent).html">Keishi</a> or Kaboku (a man servant), and at <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Gozan (a term relating to Zen temples).html">Gozan</a>, it was appointed to Inryouken house-hold. </p>
<p>The word 'Soja' first appeared in the Heian period, but was more often seen in the Muromachi period. Moushitsugi and Soja are used in the same meaning ("Nippo jisho" [Japanese-Portuguese dictionary] defines Shoja, Moushitusgi and Toritsugite [a person in charge of informing a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> or <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> of the name of visitors to the residence before a meeting] as synonyms). However, in the Imperial Court, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> and the Sekkan families, this position was often called 'Moushitsugi,' whereas it was often called 'Soja' in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shugo daimyo.html">Shugo daimyo</a> (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a>, which were Japanese provincial military governors, that became <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a>, which were Japanese feudal lords) and Sengoku <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> (Japanese territorial lord in the Sengoku period). 'Soja' was exclusively used in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Oda government.html">Oda government</a>, the Toyotomi government and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Edo bakufu.html">Edo bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>), all of which rose to the central authority from the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Sengoku Daimyo (Japanese territorial lord in the Sengoku period).html">Sengoku Daimyo</a>. In the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Edo bakufu.html">Edo bakufu</a>, Fudai <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> (a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> in hereditary vassal to the Tokugawa family) was mainly appointed to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Sojaban (an official in charge of the ceremonies).html">Sojaban</a> (an official in charge of the ceremonies), and was simply called 'Soja,' and in charge of the duties of Moushitsugi. </p>
