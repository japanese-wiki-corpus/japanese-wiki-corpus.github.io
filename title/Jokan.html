<h1>Jokan (政官)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>"Jokan" (written as "上官" or "政官") is the collective term for government officers who were mainly engaged in clerical work in the Daijokan (Grand Council of State) under the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ritsuryo.html">Ritsuryo</a> system (a system of a centralized government based on the Ritsuryo Code). Jokan was a broadly used term to indicate government officials such as the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shonagon (Post in Daijokan).html">Shonagon</a> (lesser councilor of state), <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Benkan (Collective name of posts in Daijokan).html">Benkan</a> (controller) and Geki (secretary of the Grand Council of State), who were the three directors of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Sankyoku (sanqu in Chinese).html">Sankyoku</a> (an assortment of three bureaus: the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shonagon (Post in Daijokan).html">Shonagon</a> bureau, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Benkan (Collective name of posts in Daijokan).html">Benkan</a> bureau and Geki bureau, respectively), the Shi (an official in charge of records), the Shisho (an official in charge of miscellaneous documents) and lower ranking <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Kanjin.html">Kanjin</a> (government officials) affiliated with the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Sankyoku (sanqu in Chinese).html">Sankyoku</a>, or in other words, Jokan indicates all of the officials of the Daijokan except the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kugyo.html">Kugyo</a> (top court officials) and the Giseikan (Legislature). </p>
<p>On the other hand, there are also examples contradicting the term as stated above, such as one that includes the post of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Naiki (government posts).html">Naiki</a> (Secretary of the Ministry of Central Affairs) in charge of producing official documents like Shochoku (imperial rescripts) and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Senmyo (an Imperial Edict).html">Senmyo</a> (imperial edicts) as a Jokan; an example that Jokan only indicates the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shonagon (Post in Daijokan).html">Shonagon</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Benkan (Collective name of posts in Daijokan).html">Benkan</a> but not the Geki; and a contrasting example showing that the term is limited to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Kanjin.html">Kanjin</a> lower in rank than Geki and Shi. In later years, however, the word Jokan was often used in the same sense as described in the last example, as illustrated by examples from the "Irohajirui-sho"(Kango-Japanese Dictionary from the Heian Period) where it is explained that Geki and Shi were referred to as Jokan. In addition, according to "Kakai-sho Commentary" by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshinari YOTSUTSUJI.html">Yoshinari YOTSUTSUJI</a>, the term originated from "Daijokan-hi-kan" (a government official reporting directly to the Daijokan, written as “太政官被官”) which contains the phonetic equivalent of "Jokan," sometimes written as "上官." In another case, in the "Myomoku sho" by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Sanehiro TOIN.html">Sanehiro TOIN</a>, the pronunciation for the Chinese characters "政官" was said to be "ja-u-gu-ha-mu." Jokan was never adopted as an official word in the Ritsuryo-Kyakushiki (Laws of codes and ethics under the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ritsuryo.html">Ritsuryo</a> system) however, and it is assumed that it was originally a slang word used within noble society. </p>
<p>Jokan dealt with practical works such as producing <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Daijokanpu.html">Daijokanpu</a> (official documents issued by the Daijokan) and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Senji (imperial decree).html">Senji</a> (imperial decree), comparing and examining the precedents and producing records for Kuji and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Gishiki (Book).html">Gishiki</a> (political operations and ceremonies of the Imperial Court) and handling personnel affairs. As Jokan also took charge of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Katanashi.html">katanashi</a> (a ritual for reading out bound documents on the government affairs before the actual work starts) in Kansei (Imperial meetings at a Daijokan agency) and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Gekisei.html">Gekisei</a> (meetings at a Geki agency), it increased its role and the status of Geki and Shi in particular much improved. Later on, the Joshu (director) of the Geki was called Kyokumu (Chief Secretary of the Daijokan), the Joshu of the Shi was called Kanmu and these two came to hold the highest positions in the Daijokan <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Kanjin.html">Kanjin</a> aside from the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kugyo.html">Kugyo</a> and Giseikan. </p>
