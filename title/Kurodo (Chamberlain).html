<p><h3>History</h3>
</p>
<p>In 809, Emperor Heizei assigned his throne to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Saga.html">Emperor Saga</a>, and moved to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Heijo-kyo.html">Heijo-kyo</a> (the ancient capital of Japan in current Nara) as the Retired Emperor Heizei. At this time, his choki (a favorite mistress), <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Kusuko.html">FUJIWARA no Kusuko</a> of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kokyu (empresss residence).html">kokyu</a> (empress's residence), and her older brother, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Nakanari.html">FUJIWARA no Nakanari</a> accompanied him, but, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Kusuko.html">FUJIWARA no Kusuko</a> was in the position of kami (director) (naishinokami (or <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Shoji (Paper Sliding Screen).html">shoji</a>; Principal Handmaid) of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Naishi.html">naishi</a> no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Tsukasa (a rank in government offices).html">tsukasa</a> (female palace attendants) which played a role of secretary to the emperor. Therefore, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Saga.html">Emperor Saga</a> who were in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Heian-kyo.html">Heian-kyo</a> without a secretary had a problem in documentation and clerical work. Furthermore, since there was a conflict with the Retired Emperor which brought about the Kusuko Incident, in 810, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Fuyutsugu.html">FUJIWARA no Fuyutsugu</a> and KOZE no Notari were appointed as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kurodo no to (the name of a post).html">Kurodo no to</a> (Head Chamberlain), and Mano KIYOHARA was appointed as kurodo, as new secretaries. This was the start of the history of the kurodo. Such appointments were conducted also for the purpose of preventing secrets from being leaked to the side of the Retired Emperor Heizei. Thereafter, the authority was strengthened during the periods of Emperors Koko and Uda, and the organization was expanded. <h3>Official duties</h3>

Eventually, Kurododokoro stopped handling suits, but became an institution handling everything handled by tenjobito (a high-ranking courtier allowed into the Imperial Palace) such as transmission of Shochoku (imperial edict) and Joso (report to the throne), guard, clerical work, routine tasks and so on.
