<p><h3>History</h3>
</p>
<p>In 809, Emperor Heizei assigned his throne to Emperor Saga, and moved to Heijo-kyo (the ancient capital of Japan in current Nara) as the Retired Emperor Heizei. At this time, his choki (a favorite mistress), FUJIWARA no Kusuko of kokyu (empress's residence), and her older brother, FUJIWARA no Nakanari accompanied him, but, FUJIWARA no Kusuko was in the position of kami (director) (naishinokami (or shoji; Principal Handmaid) of naishi no tsukasa (female palace attendants) which played a role of secretary to the emperor. Therefore, Emperor Saga who were in Heian-kyo without a secretary had a problem in documentation and clerical work. Furthermore, since there was a conflict with the Retired Emperor which brought about the Kusuko Incident, in 810, FUJIWARA no Fuyutsugu and KOZE no Notari were appointed as Kurodo no to (Head Chamberlain), and Mano KIYOHARA was appointed as kurodo, as new secretaries. This was the start of the history of the kurodo. Such appointments were conducted also for the purpose of preventing secrets from being leaked to the side of the Retired Emperor Heizei. Thereafter, the authority was strengthened during the periods of Emperors Koko and Uda, and the organization was expanded. <h3>Official duties</h3>
</p>
<p>As a domestic governing institution of the Imperial Family, Kurododokoro was originally in charge of management of documents and gyobutsu (Imperial treasures), handling of confidential documents, and handling of suits.

In the mid Heian period, Kurododokoro came to handle matters concerning all domestic governing institution of the Imperial Family which were called '-sho' or '-dokoro' such as Naijudokoro (Royal Pages Office), Mikushige-dono (the place handling clothes in the Imperial palace), Shinmotsudokoro (Serving Office), Outadokoro (an organization that provided the education and management for ancient Japanese music, Uta, and traditional instruments), Gakusho (chamber of music), Tsukumodokoro (a palace office responsible for making accessories and furnishings), Goshodokoro (an office to maintain books in the Imperial Court), Ippon-goshodokoro, Uchi no goshodokoro (the place that kept Emperor's books), Edokoro (Imperial office treating about pictures) and so on. <h3>Constitution</h3>
