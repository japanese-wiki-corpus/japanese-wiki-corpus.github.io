<h1>Omote <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yuhitsu.html">Yuhitsu</a> (表右筆)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Omote <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yuhitsu.html">Yuhitsu</a> was one of the office organizations of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Edo bakufu.html">Edo bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>). They served as amanuenses of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>. That was paired with Oku <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yuhitsu.html">Yuhitsu</a>. </p>
<p>Originally in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Edo bakufu.html">Edo bakufu</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yuhitsu.html">yuhitsu</a> served as close adviser to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Seii Taishogun.html">Seii Taishogun</a> (literally, "great general who subdues the barbarians") writing <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Gonaisho.html">gonaisho</a> (a letter issued over the signature of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>), hosho (a document for informing lower-rank people of the decision of upper people such as an emperor or <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>), making a fair copy of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Hatto (Lecture Hall).html">hatto</a> (law) and preparing official documents under the orders of roju (member of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>'s council of elders), but when <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Tsunayoshi TOKUGAWA.html">Tsunayoshi TOKUGAWA</a> became <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>, he brought <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yuhitsu.html">yuhitsu</a> of the time of Tatebayashi Domain to Edo-jo Castle and involved in his secrets instead of existing <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yuhitsu.html">yuhitsu</a>. Therefore existing <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yuhitsu.html">yuhitsu</a> were called 'omote <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yuhitsu.html">yuhitsu</a>' and new <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yuhitsu.html">yuhitsu</a> were called 'oku <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yuhitsu.html">yuhitsu</a>' and they had different duties and the important duties around <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> were imposed on oku <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yuhitsu.html">yuhitsu</a>. After that, a practice was established in which the successor was chosen from omote <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yuhitsu.html">yuhitsu</a> when 'oku <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yuhitsu.html">yuhitsu</a>' had a vacant position, and the official duties began to be divided. </p>
<p>Therefore omote <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yuhitsu.html">yuhitsu</a> became just a amanuensis of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> and their duties began to be limited to make roju hosho, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> nikki (diary of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>), Shuinjyo (a vermillion seal letter), autographic signature and to make fair copy of furegaki (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> orders) (about 400 pieces) to distribute from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> across the country and to manage Bugencho (Registers of vassals) of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> (feudal lords) and list of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>'s retainers such as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Hatamoto (direct retainers of shogun).html">hatamoto</a> (direct retainers of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Edo bakufu.html">Edo bakufu</a>). </p>
<p>Omote <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yuhitsu.html">yuhitsu</a> were composed of 2 or 3 kumigashira (a head of the group) (300 bales of yakudaka [salary paid in accordance with the rank of one's post]) and about 30 omote <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yuhitsu.html">yuhitsu</a> (150 bales of yakudaka). </p>
