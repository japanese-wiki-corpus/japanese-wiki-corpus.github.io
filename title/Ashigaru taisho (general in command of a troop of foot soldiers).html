<h1><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ashigaru.html">Ashigaru</a> taisho (general in command of a troop of foot soldiers) (足軽大将)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>An <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ashigaru.html">Ashigaru</a> taisho was a commanding officer who lead <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ashigaru.html">Ashigaru</a> troops (foot soldiers) under a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> (Japanese territorial lord) during Japan's <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Sengoku Period (period of warring states) (Japan).html">Sengoku Period</a> (Period of Warring States). They were also called Ashigarugashira. During the Edo period, they were also referred to as Monogashira. </p>
<p>Until the Muromachi period, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ashigaru.html">Ashigaru</a> had served as a type of military engineer. After the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Onin War.html">Onin War</a>, as officers and soldiers in battles wore only light armor, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ashigaru.html">Ashigaru</a> came to have an active role as a main battle force. During the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Sengoku Period (period of warring states) (Japan).html">Sengoku Period</a>, battles became more organized and complex on a large scale and the role of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ashigaru.html">Ashigaru</a> became increasingly important due to their mobility. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ashigaru.html">Ashigaru</a> troops in particular, who were trained with spears, bows and guns, were organized and became active as a main fighting force. Retainers of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> who were appointed to the position of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ashigaru.html">Ashigaru</a> taisho made great achievements leading <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ashigaru.html">Ashigaru</a> troops. They were ranked immediately below the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Sodaisho (a commander in chief).html">Sodaisho</a> (commander in chief) and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Samurai daisho.html">Samurai daisho</a> (commander of warriors) and lead soldiers including <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ashigaru.html">Ashigaru</a> kogashira (also called <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ashigaru.html">Ashigaru</a> kumigashira) (foot soldier captains) who were their own subordinates. </p>
<p>Due to their achievements, the position of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ashigaru.html">Ashigaru</a> taisho gradually rose, and in the late <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Sengoku Period (period of warring states) (Japan).html">Sengoku Period</a> they were provided with an annual stipend of 200 to 500 koku, and regarded as the middle-class warriors. </p>
