<h1>Baron (男爵)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Baron (called danshaku in Japanese) is a title of nobility. It is the fifth highest rank of peerage (Gotoshaku) in ancient China, modern Japan, and England. It is ranked below Viscount. There is a title that corresponds to baron in the peerage systems of France, Germany, and Russia. </p>
<p><h3>Barons in Europe</h3>
</p>
<p>Danshaku in Japanese corresponds to Baron in English. The feminine equivalent of Baron is Baroness, and is used for the wife of a Baron or a woman having the title of Baron (female Baron). </p>
<p>In England, a Baron is the lowest-ranked title that is eligible for a peerage. 
<br/>In England, it is rare to call a man of this peerage Baron; rather, they use the general title Lord, such as 'Lord Smith.'<br/>
</p>
<p>In Scotland, a Baron is not a title of peerage, and the corresponding peerage is called 'Lord of Parliament.'<br/>
</p>
<p>Although almost all other European countries including Russia use the title Baron, Germany uses Freiherr instead. <h3>Japanese Barons</h3>
</p>
<p>It was established after the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period, and it was determined as the peerage of the lowest rank. The following people received the title of Baron. </p>
<p>Kuge (court nobles)<br/>
</p>
<p>People who were raised to the peerage after the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Meiji Restoration (Meiji-ishin).html">Meiji Restoration</a><br/>
Families separated from their head families (26 families) and a number of Buddhist monks (those who were originally court nobles of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Kofuku-ji Temple.html">Kofuku-ji Temple</a>) who returned to secular life during the time when anti-Buddhist movement was getting stronger (called the Nara peerage, 27 families). Furthermore, the following families received the title of Baron: the Oshikoji family and the Mibu family, whose social standings were particularly high among the Jige-ke (family status of non-noble retainers who are not allowed into the Emperor's living quarters in the imperial palace); the Tamamasu family (<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Kanin-ryu (a linage of court noble of a branch one of the Fujiwara clique).html">Kanin-ryu</a>, one of the Fujiwara faction); the descendants of Misao TAMAMATSU, who was from court nobility and made a great contribution to the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Meiji Restoration (Meiji-ishin).html">Meiji Restoration</a>; and the Nishitakatsuji family, who served as Guji (chief of those who serve shrines, control festivals and general affairs) of Dazaifu <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Tenman-gu Shrine.html">Tenman-gu Shrine</a> and who were a branch family of the Takatsuji family. <h3><a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Samurai.html">Samurai</a> family (buke)</h3>
</p>
<p>People who were raised to the peerage after the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Meiji Restoration (Meiji-ishin).html">Meiji Restoration</a><br/>
They are the people of the families who were separated from the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Daimyo.html">Daimyo</a> (Feudal Lord)'s family after the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period (35 families). The following 11 families and the Yoshikawa clan of Suo Iwakuni Domain, who had been raised to the peerage since the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> era, received the title of Baron: 5 families who owned more than 10,000 koku of crop yields as the attendant chief retainer of three privileged branches - the Ando family of the Kii Tanabe Domain, the Takenokoshi family of the Mino Imao Domain, the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/family/Nakayama family.html">Nakayama family</a> of the Hitachi Matsuoka Domain, the Naruse family of the Owari Inuyama Domain and the Mizuno family of the Kii Shingu Domain, and 6 families of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Kotaiyoriai.html">kotaiyoriai</a>, a family status of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> warriors in the Edo period, who owned more than 10,000 koku of rice during the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Meiji Restoration (Meiji-ishin).html">Meiji Restoration</a> - the Ikeda family of the Harima Fukumoto Domain, the Ikoma family of the Dewa Yashima Domain, the Hirano family of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Yamato.html">Yamato</a> <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Tawaramoto Domain.html">Tawaramoto Domain</a>, the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Hondo (The main hall).html">Hondo</a> family of the Hitachi Shizuku Domain, the Yamazaki family of the Bitchu Nariwa Domain and the Yamana family of the Tajima Muraoka Domain. The Hayashi family, who were deprived of their <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> status during the Boshin War, received the title of Baron, having been raised to the peerage from the warrior class. The Inada family, Hitto karo (the head of chief retainers) of the Tokushima Domain, were bestowed the title of Baron as an award for their great achievement in the development of Hokkaido. The Honda family, who were the chief retainers of the Matsudaira family of the Fukui domain, were first judged as <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Baishin (indirect vassal).html">baishin</a> (indirect vassal) and were given the class of warriors, however, they were finally given the title of Baron after the petition and riots known as the Takefu incident. </p>
<p>Buddhist priesthood and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> priesthood<br/>
</p>
<p>None of these were particularly suitable as a Baron under the bylaw, however, the following were raised to the peerage: <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> priests of local areas, especially from the old families (the Arakita family of Ise Jingu Shrine, Kawabe family, Matsumoto family of Ise Jingu Shrine, Aso family of Aso-jinja Shrine, Itouzu family and Miyanari family of Usa-jingu Shrine, Ono family of Hinomisaki-jinja Shrine, Kaneko family of Mononobe-jinja Shrine (in Ota city), the Ki family of Hinokuma-jingu Shrine and Kunikakasu-jingu Shrine, Kitajima family and Sen family of Izumo-taisha Shrine, Senshu family of Atsuta-jingu Shrine, the Tsumori family of Sumiyoshitaisha Shrine, Takachiho family of Tendai Shugen zasu (head priest of the temple) of Hikosan; Family names in bold letters indicate that they were kuninomiyatsuko (the heads of local governments), and Buddhist priests' families which inherited positions (the Kibe family, the chief abbot of the Kibe school of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Jodo Shinshu.html">Jodo Shinshu</a> - the True Pure Land Sect of Buddhism, the Shibuya family, the chief abbot of the Shibuya school of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Jodo Shinshu.html">Jodo Shinshu</a>, and the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Hanazono (Kyoto City).html">Hanazono</a> family, the chief abbot of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Kosho-ji Temple.html">Kosho-ji Temple</a> of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Jodo Shinshu.html">Jodo Shinshu</a>).

<p>New nobility<br/>
</p>
<p>People who have made outstanding contributions to the country. Except politicians, bureaucrats, and members of the armed forces, the title of Baron was also given to businesspeople such as the Mitsui family, Sumitomo family, Konoike family, and Iwasaki family. Also, many families of karo (chief retainer of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a>, Japanese territorial lord) of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Taihan.html">taihan</a> (large scale domains) received the title of Baron as a reward for their outstanding contribution to the country during the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Meiji Restoration (Meiji-ishin).html">Meiji Restoration</a>. </p>

<p>The councilors of the Japanese House of Peers were chosen from barons by a mutual vote among themselves. </p>
<p>In Japan, Baron is the most well known title as well as Duke and Hakushaku (Count, Earl in England); Barons often appear in Japanese literary works and comic books.
