<h1>Baron (男爵)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Baron (called danshaku in Japanese) is a title of nobility. It is the fifth highest rank of peerage (Gotoshaku) in ancient China, modern Japan, and England. It is ranked below Viscount. There is a title that corresponds to baron in the peerage systems of France, Germany, and Russia. </p>
<p><h3>Barons in Europe</h3>
</p>
<p>Danshaku in Japanese corresponds to Baron in English. The feminine equivalent of Baron is Baroness, and is used for the wife of a Baron or a woman having the title of Baron (female Baron). </p>
<p>In England, a Baron is the lowest-ranked title that is eligible for a peerage. 
<br/>In England, it is rare to call a man of this peerage Baron; rather, they use the general title Lord, such as 'Lord Smith.'<br/>
</p>
<p>In Scotland, a Baron is not a title of peerage, and the corresponding peerage is called 'Lord of Parliament.'<br/>
</p>
<p>Although almost all other European countries including Russia use the title Baron, Germany uses Freiherr instead. <h3>Japanese Barons</h3>

Families separated from their head families (26 families) and a number of Buddhist monks (those who were originally court nobles of the Kofuku-ji Temple) who returned to secular life during the time when anti-Buddhist movement was getting stronger (called the Nara peerage, 27 families). Furthermore, the following families received the title of Baron: the Oshikoji family and the Mibu family, whose social standings were particularly high among the Jige-ke (family status of non-noble retainers who are not allowed into the Emperor's living quarters in the imperial palace); the Tamamasu family (Kanin-ryu, one of the Fujiwara faction); the descendants of Misao TAMAMATSU, who was from court nobility and made a great contribution to the Meiji Restoration; and the Nishitakatsuji family, who served as Guji (chief of those who serve shrines, control festivals and general affairs) of Dazaifu Tenman-gu Shrine and who were a branch family of the Takatsuji family. <h3>Samurai family (buke)</h3>

<p>Buddhist priesthood and Shinto priesthood<br/>

Among them, 18 families, except the Otani family of Nishi Hongan-ji Temple, were given the title of Baron. </p>
<p>New nobility<br/>
</p>
<p>People who have made outstanding contributions to the country. Except politicians, bureaucrats, and members of the armed forces, the title of Baron was also given to businesspeople such as the Mitsui family, Sumitomo family, Konoike family, and Iwasaki family.

</p>
<p>Takeomi KIKUCHI, Yorisada GOJO, Nagayasu NAWA, Yukiyoshi NANBU, Toshizumi NITTA were also raised to the peerage and given the title of Baron as the descendants of meritorious retainers of the Southern Court (Japan). </p>

<p>In Japan, Baron is the most well known title as well as Duke and Hakushaku (Count, Earl in England); Barons often appear in Japanese literary works and comic books.
