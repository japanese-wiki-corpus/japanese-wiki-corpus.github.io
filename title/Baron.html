<p></p>
<p>Baron (called danshaku in Japanese) is a title of nobility. It is the fifth highest rank of peerage (Gotoshaku) in ancient China, modern Japan, and England. It is ranked below Viscount. There is a title that corresponds to baron in the peerage systems of France, Germany, and Russia. </p>
<p><h3>Barons in Europe</h3>
</p>
<p>Danshaku in Japanese corresponds to Baron in English. The feminine equivalent of Baron is Baroness, and is used for the wife of a Baron or a woman having the title of Baron (female Baron). </p>
<p>In England, a Baron is the lowest-ranked title that is eligible for a peerage. 
<br/>In England, it is rare to call a man of this peerage Baron; rather, they use the general title Lord, such as 'Lord Smith.'<br/>
</p>
<p>In Scotland, a Baron is not a title of peerage, and the corresponding peerage is called 'Lord of Parliament.'<br/>
</p>
<p>Although almost all other European countries including Russia use the title Baron, Germany uses Freiherr instead. <h3>Japanese Barons</h3>
</p>
<p>It was established after the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period, and it was determined as the peerage of the lowest rank. The following people received the title of Baron. </p>

Furthermore, the following families received the title of Baron: the Oshikoji family and the Mibu family, whose social standings were particularly high among the Jige-ke (family status of non-noble retainers who are not allowed into the Emperor's living quarters in the imperial palace); the Tamamasu family (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kanin-ryu (a linage of court noble of a branch one of the Fujiwara clique).html">Kanin-ryu</a>, one of the Fujiwara faction); the descendants of Misao TAMAMATSU, who was from court nobility and made a great contribution to the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Meiji Restoration (Meiji-ishin).html">Meiji Restoration</a>; and the Nishitakatsuji family, who served as Guji (chief of those who serve shrines, control festivals and general affairs) of Dazaifu <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Tenman-gu Shrine.html">Tenman-gu Shrine</a> and who were a branch family of the Takatsuji family. <h3><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">Samurai</a> family (buke)</h3>

<p>People who were raised to the peerage after the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Meiji Restoration (Meiji-ishin).html">Meiji Restoration</a><br/>

The Hayashi family, who were deprived of their <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> status during the Boshin War, received the title of Baron, having been raised to the peerage from the warrior class. The Inada family, Hitto karo (the head of chief retainers) of the Tokushima Domain, were bestowed the title of Baron as an award for their great achievement in the development of Hokkaido.

Also, many families of karo (chief retainer of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a>, Japanese territorial lord) of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Taihan.html">taihan</a> (large scale domains) received the title of Baron as a reward for their outstanding contribution to the country during the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Meiji Restoration (Meiji-ishin).html">Meiji Restoration</a>. </p>
