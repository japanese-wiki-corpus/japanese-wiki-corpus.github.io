<h1><a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> family (将軍家)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> family was a houshold system where the head of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a>, who was designated as seii taishogun (literally: "great general who subdues the barbarians") or for the head of palace guards, generated, in the medieval times in Japan, imitating the houshold system of kuge (the court noble) when establishing his government. In addition to the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> himself, it included the heir and other family members, after a hereditary system was established, and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Mandokoro.html">mandokoro</a>, its household organization. </p>
<p>This concept was first introduced when <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/MINAMOTO no Yoritomo.html">MINAMOTO no Yoritomo</a> was designated as Ukone no daisho (Major Captain of the Right Division of Inner Palace Guards), and he applied this concept to his own master-servant relationships. This term was used for Yoritomo and his vassals, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Gokenin.html">gokenin</a> to establish control of the nation by themselves independent of the imperial court. Later, Yoritomo himself was designated for seii taishogun (literally, "great general who subdues the barbarians"), followed by his sons, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/MINAMOTO no Yoriie.html">MINAMOTO no Yoriie</a> and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/MINAMOTO no Sanetomo.html">MINAMOTO no Sanetomo</a>, establishing the system of making the post of seii taishogun hereditary. Then the term '<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> family,' an abbreviation of the 'seii taishogun family' and of the former 'udaisho' (the head of the right division) family, both Yoritomo's position names, was established. </p>
<p>Since <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/MINAMOTO no Sanetomo.html">MINAMOTO no Sanetomo</a> in the post of seii taishogun also assumed the post of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Udaijin (Minister of the Right).html">udaijin</a> (minister of the right), it became possible for the person in the post of seii taishogun to assume a daijin (minister) post. However, during the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period, the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> from Sekkan-ke (the families which produced regents) and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> from the imperial court did not take the post of ministry even after he was released from the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> post. It was <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Yoshimitsu ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshimitsu ASHIKAGA</a> during the Muromachi period, who took the post of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Naidaijin (inner minister).html">naidaijin</a> (Inner minister), when <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> assumed the post of a ministry again. </p>
<p>During the Muromachi period, the term kubo instead of shogunke (<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> family) was used for seii taishogun. In the Edo period, the term was used for Tokugawa gosanke (three privileged branches of Tokugawa family), for Gosankyo (three privileged branches of Tokugawa family), and for the heir of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> against a child from a legally unwedded wife of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>. </p>
<p>The <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> family played the role of the clan governing Japan throughout the samurai-based government era. Although designated by the Emperor, it boasted the power exceeding that of the imperial family in the era when the samurai-based government was first established. Although the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> family was formally placed under the imperial court, it was customary that the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> family was accepted as a royal family by foreign countries. </p>
