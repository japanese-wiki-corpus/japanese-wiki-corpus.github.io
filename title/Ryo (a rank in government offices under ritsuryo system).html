<h1>Ryo (a rank in government offices under ritsuryo system) (寮 (律令制))</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Ryo was a rank in government offices under the ancient Japanese ritsuryo legal code system. </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>Ryo took charge of clerical work together with Shiki (ritsuryo system) and Tsukasa mainly under the ministries (Nakatsukasasho, Shikibusho, Jibusho, Minbusho, and Kunaisho). Shitokan, the regular officials, were described as Kami, Suke, Jo, and Sakan, respectively. Ryo had a lot of important branches, and only one branch, Sanniryo, was abolished. </p>
<p>Some Tsukasa like Meryo and Hyogoryo became independent. </p>
<p>Sahyogo and Uhyogo usually do not have the suffix 'ryo.'<br/>
</p>
<p>Ryo can be classified further into two ranks according to the number of officials and their court ranks. <h3>List of Ryo</h3>
