<h1>Mikinotsukasa (branch office of ministry) (造酒司)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Mikinotsukasa (also called Sakenotsukasa) was a branch office of Kunaisho, erected under the ritsuryo legal code system. </p>
<p>Its main duty was supervising brewing of sake, amasake, and vinegar. In Mikinotsukasa, three Shitokan officials, i.e., Kami, Jo, and Sakan were placed; on the other hand, an official corresponding to Suke was not prepared. Also, Sakabe and Tsukaibe were placed. Sakadono for brewing sake was built in Mikinotsukasa, where officials such as Betto and Ben were placed. </p>
