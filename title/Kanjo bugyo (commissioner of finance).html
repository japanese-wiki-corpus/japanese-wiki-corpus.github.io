This <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Bugyo.html">bugyo</a> constituted the three <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Bugyo.html">bugyo</a> together with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Jisha-bugyo.html">jisha-bugyo</a> (in charge of affairs of shrines and temples) and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Machi-bugyo (town magistrate).html">machi-bugyo</a> (in charge of affairs of town people), and these theree <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Bugyo.html">bugyo</a> were the members of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Hyojosho (conference chamber).html">hyojosho</a> (a conference chamber). By the Genroku era (1688 - 1703), this post was also called kanjo-gashira (the head of accounting officers). In the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Hyojosho (conference chamber).html">hyojosho</a>, law suits in Kanhasshu (the eight provinces of Kanto region) except Edo-fu were handled by the kanji <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Bugyo.html">bugyo</a>. The number of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Kanjo.html">kanjo</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Bugyo.html">bugyo</a> was four, and the amount of rice yields allocated to the officer was 3000 koku (approx. 180 liters/koku). Placed directly under Roju (the second-highest post in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> government), <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Kanjo.html">kanjo</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Bugyo.html">bugyo</a> controlled <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Gundai.html">Gundai</a> (a post of controlling territories of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>), <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daikan (local governor).html">Daikan</a> (also a post of controlling territories of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>, but the controlling area was smaller than that of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Gundai.html">Gundai</a>), and Kurabugyo (an officer in charge of rice crop stocks of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>). In 1698 and later, one of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Kanjo.html">kanjo</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Bugyo.html">bugyo</a> officers was also in charge of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Dochu-bugyo (a governmental post in the Edo bakufu).html">Dochu-bugyo</a> (the post in charge of road-related affairs) together with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Ometsuke (inspector general).html">Ometsuke</a> (the post of watching <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> and the Imperial court). In 1721, the post was separated into Kattekata-kanjo-bugyo mainly dealing with finance and civil administration and Kujikata-kanjo-bugyo mainly dealing with law suit related matters. The job of the Kattekata post and that of the Kujikata post were totally different, though they had the same name. </p>
