<h1>Kanjo bugyo (commissioner of finance) (勘定奉行)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kanjo bugyo was a governmental post in the Edo period and the highest accounting officer, who was in charge of finance and control of the tenryo (the areas controlled directly by the bakufu). This bugyo constituted the three bugyo together with jisha-bugyo (in charge of affairs of shrines and temples) and machi-bugyo (in charge of affairs of town people), and these theree bugyo were the members of hyojosho (a conference chamber). By the Genroku era (1688 - 1703), this post was also called kanjo-gashira (the head of accounting officers). In the hyojosho, law suits in Kanhasshu (the eight provinces of Kanto region) except Edo-fu were handled by the kanji bugyo. The number of kanjo bugyo was four, and the amount of rice yields allocated to the officer was 3000 koku (approx. 180 liters/koku). Placed directly under Roju (the second-highest post in the bakufu government), kanjo bugyo controlled Gundai (a post of controlling territories of the bakufu), Daikan (also a post of controlling territories of the bakufu, but the controlling area was smaller than that of Gundai), and Kurabugyo (an officer in charge of rice crop stocks of the bakufu). In 1698 and later, one of the kanjo bugyo officers was also in charge of Dochu-bugyo (the post in charge of road-related affairs) together with Ometsuke (the post of watching daimyo and the Imperial court). In 1721, the post was separated into Kattekata-kanjo-bugyo mainly dealing with finance and civil administration and Kujikata-kanjo-bugyo mainly dealing with law suit related matters. The job of the Kattekata post and that of the Kujikata post were totally different, though they had the same name. </p>
