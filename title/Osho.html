<h1>Osho (和尚)</h1>
<p>Osho (Sanskrit: upādhyāya) is an honorific title for Buddhist priests. </p>
<p>The original meaning was a teacher who regularly gave instruction to a priest who has been ordained and entered the priesthood. In "Jujuritsu" it indicates the ordaining master. </p>
<p>In Japan the title of Daiosho (Great Osho) was given to Ganjin, who came over to teach the precepts in 758, and later was used as a title of respect for high level priests, and eventually for those at the level of chief priest and above. </p>
<p>The manner of writing and pronunciation varies by sect, and in some regions the word is even shortened to 'Ossan' or 'Ossama' (with the accent in the beginning). </p>
