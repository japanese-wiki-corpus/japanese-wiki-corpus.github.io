<h1>Doboshu (同朋衆)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Doboshu were people who had the responsibility for miscellaneous duties and entertainment near the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> since the Muromachi period. It originated from excellent entertainers who gathered together in Ji sect founded by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Ippen.html">Ippen</a>. Doboshu were also called Amishu and Obozushu. It was abolished in 1866. </p>
<p>In the Ji sect, there is a custom of identifying themselves as Amigo (the pseudonym of Ami), but even if they use Amigo, it is not always true that they are a Buddhist monk of the Ji sect. Examples are Kanami, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Zeami.html">Zeami</a> and Doboshu in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Edo bakufu.html">Edo bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>). </p>
<p><h3>The transition of the system</h3>
</p>
<p>Following the end of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period, many of the Jinso (monks who accompanied <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> into war) were Buddhist monks from the Ji sect, so their connections with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> (buke) families became stronger; in times of peace, they provided <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> warriors with entertainment by making use of their abilities in the performing arts, while also fulfilling their duties as aides and intermediaries. </p>
<p>The origin of the system of Doboshu began when <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoriyuki HOSOKAWA.html">Yoriyuki HOSOKAWA</a> became a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shitsuji.html">shitsuji</a> (steward), had 6 Buddhist monks, and had them serve <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshimitsu ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshimitsu ASHIKAGA</a>. Dobo were in charge of performing arts such as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Sarugaku.html">sarugaku</a> and landscape gardening, and during the reign of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshimasa ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshimasa ASHIKAGA</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Noami.html">Noami</a> (one of the major Doboshu) with a good judgment concerning imported goods from China made selections of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Higashiyama (Kyoto Prefecture).html">Higashiyama</a> gomotsu (tools for tea ceremonies, etc. held by Yoshimasa). In addition, it is said that the stone gardens of the Ryoan-ji and Daisen-in Temples were made by Soami (one of the major Doboshu), and thought to have had a great influence on forming <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Higashiyama culture.html">Higashiyama culture</a>. </p>
<p>Subsequently, Doboshu also served <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Nobunaga ODA.html">Nobunaga ODA</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI.html">Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI</a>. During the reign of the Tokugawa clan, the system began in 1580 when TANI Shinrokuro Masatsugi (later his last name became UCHIDA) changed his name into <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Zenami.html">Zenami</a> and started serving <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Ieyasu TOKUGAWA.html">Ieyasu TOKUGAWA</a> as Doboshu. And then, Doboshu managed Edo-jo Castle, directed and supervised the Okubozushu, serving under the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Wakadoshiyori.html">Wakadoshiyori</a> (a managerial position in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Edo bakufu.html">Edo bakufu</a>) in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Edo bakufu.html">Edo bakufu</a>. <h3>Main Doboshu</h3>
