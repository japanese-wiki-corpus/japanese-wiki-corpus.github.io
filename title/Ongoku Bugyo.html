Because it became a window of negotiations with foreign countries toward the end of the Shogunate, the number of positions was increased, and in 1842-1844 and 1854-1860 Shimoda <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Bugyo.html">Bugyo</a> was installed again to provide for the arrival of foreign ships, during which time the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Bugyo.html">Bugyo</a> offices in Uraga and Shimoda existed concurrently. Members of the Aizu clan mainly filled the post. <h3>Yamada <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Bugyo.html">Bugyo</a></h3>
</p>
<p>Also called Ise <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Bugyo.html">Bugyo</a>. At first, the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Bugyo.html">Bugyo</a> office was located at Yamada in Ise Province (present-day Ise City, Mie Prefecture), and was later moved to Kobayashi, Watarai District, Ise Province (present-day Kobayashi, Misono Village, Ise City). Was in charge of guarding Ise-jingu Shrine and ruling the temple town, litigation in Ise and Shima, and security in Toba Port. There was one position, then became two in 1696, with stations alternating between the field and Edo. Allotment was 1000 koku, and a stipend of 1500 bales of rice was provided. Subordinates were 6 <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Yoriki (a governmental post in the Edo bakufu).html">yoriki</a>, 70 <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Doshin (patrol officer).html">doshin</a> and 40 suishu (sailor). Because it had contact with the fief of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/family/Kishu Tokugawa family.html">Kishu Tokugawa family</a>, one of Tokugawa gosanke (three privileged branches of Tokugawa family), disputes occurred periodically; Tadasuke OOKA, who was active as the Edo Machibugyo at the time of Shogun Yoshimune, served at the post for a time; and there is known to be a legend that <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshimune TOKUGAWA.html">Yoshimune TOKUGAWA</a>, who was impressed by Tadasuke's work as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Bugyo.html">Bugyo</a> when he was chief of the Kishu clan, later chose him. </p>
<p>In 1603 the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Edo bakufu.html">Edo bakufu</a> placed the Yamada Bugyo Office on the shrine lands of Ise-daijingu Shrine. 
<br/>In addition to security of the two grand shrines Geku (outer shrine) and Naiku (inner shrine), he also controlled the supervision of suspicious foreign ships in Ise Bay and the southern sea, even outside of Ise-Shima shrine territory, but the most important duty of the Yamada <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Bugyo.html">Bugyo</a>, who was equal in standing to the Nikko <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Bugyo.html">Bugyo</a>, was to carry out the '21st year rebuilding of Ise Shrine.'<br/>
To begin with, the head priest of Ise Shrine was also in charge of rebuilding the shrine, but Tadayuki AISU, the Governor of Iyo Province, who might have been the father of Kage-ryu school founder Hisatada AISU, was the first <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> to serve as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Bugyo.html">bugyo</a> over the Shrine lands during the Bunmei years. 
<br/>[The jinryo <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Bugyo.html">bugyo</a> office was built where the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Jingu.html">Jingu</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Saishu (Chief Priest).html">saishu</a> (head priest of the Ise Shrine) had once resided.]<br/>
The Edo <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">Bakufu</a> continued the work begun by Tadayuki AISU, the Governor of Iyo Province, by rebuilding of the shrine without interruption until the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Meiji Restoration (Meiji-ishin).html">Meiji Restoration</a>, demonstrating a reverence of the gods and ancestors that was even greater than that of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Yoritomo.html">MINAMOTO no Yoritomo</a>. The cost of rebuilding the shrine is said to have been about 32.7 billion yen in 2005 at the 61st rebuilding, which shows just how much the Yamada Bugyos did for Ise-jingu Shrine over the years. </p>
<p>Even before the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Bugyo.html">Bugyo</a> came to live in Kobayashi Village in 1641, there were ships called Kujaku-maru and Tora-maru, in May of 1728 for some reason the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Bugyo.html">Bugyo</a>, Hoshina of the Awaji Governor sank the ship Tora-maru in the waters of Ominato. This is the most rare of recent events. If the Kujaku-maru is stained and there is no ship available for use, those 75 suishu/<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Doshin (patrol officer).html">doshin</a> will work regularly at their office duties' is written in Gofushin-yaku Onkumigashira HASHIMOTO Ichirozaemon Shigenaga's "Kyoho Kojitsu Biboroku."
