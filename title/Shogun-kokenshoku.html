<h1>Shogun-kokenshoku (将軍後見職)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Shogun-kokenshoku is one of the three key posts in Edo shogunate created in the final years of the Edo period, along with Seiji sosaishoku (president of political affairs) and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> shugoshoku (military governor of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>). </p>
<p>Because the 14th Seiitaishogun <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Iemochi TOKUGAWA.html">Iemochi TOKUGAWA</a> assumed office in 1858 still in his youth, Yoshiyori TAYASU from gosankyo (three privileged branches of the Tokugawa family) was chosen to take this role in August of the same year, in the name of the will of former <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Iesada TOKUGAWA.html">Iesada TOKUGAWA</a> and the precedent of Masayuki HOSHINA filling this role for the 4th <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Ietsuna TOKUGAWA.html">Ietsuna TOKUGAWA</a> and Sadanobu MATSUDAIRA for the 11th <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Ienari TOKUGAWA.html">Ienari TOKUGAWA</a> (both <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> were assumed office in youth). However, it was a formal post created by the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Tairo (chief minister).html">Tairo</a> (chief minister) <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Naosuke II.html">Naosuke II</a>, without any real power or official recognition. </p>
<p>However, in May 1862, demand from the Imperial Court to take punitive action against the followers of Ii inside the Edo shogunate led to the resignation of Yoshiyori TAYASU appointed to the post by Ii, on grounds that Iemochi had reached adulthood. This was followed by an Imperial decree ordering Yoshinobu HITOTSUBASHI be appointed Shogun-kokenshoku, as an official position in the Edo shogunate. In response, Yoshinobu was appointed to the post, now newly made official, in July of the same year. The post was abolished in March 1864 when Yoshinobu was moved to the post of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kinri Goshuei Sotoku (post to guard Kinri Palace).html">Kinri Goshuei Sotoku</a> (post to guard Kinri Palace). </p>
