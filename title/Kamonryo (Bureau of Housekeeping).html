<h1>Kamonryo (Bureau of Housekeeping) (掃部寮)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kamonryo refers to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Ryoge no kan (class outside of the Ritsuryo system).html">Ryoge no kan</a> (class outside of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ritsuryo.html">Ritsuryo</a> system) belonging to Kunaisho (Ministry of the Sovereign's Household) under the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ritsuryo.html">Ritsuryo</a> system in Ritsuryo Japan. According to "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Wamyo Ruijusho.html">Wamyo Ruijusho</a>" (dictionary of Japanese names), this was also called kanimori no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Tsukasa (a rank in government offices).html">tsukasa</a>. </p>
<p><h3>History and official duties</h3>
</p>
<p>Kamonryo was in charge of setup when court functions were held, and cleaning the inside of the palace. Therefore, some of its official duties overlapped with those of Tonomo-ryo (Bureau of Grounds) which managed and maintained facilities in the Imperial Court. Kamori (Housekeeping) of Tomo no miyatsuko (Servant of the Court administering a group) was attached, and was in charge of cleaning and setup. 80 persons of kushicho (general workers) who were assigned to government officials requiring a large number of persons were assigned, and conducted practical works. </p>
<p>In 820, Kamonryo was formed by integrating Kanimori no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Tsukasa (a rank in government offices).html">Tsukasa</a> (Housekeeping Office) of Okurasho (Ministry of the Treasury) with Uchi no Kanimori no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Tsukasa (a rank in government offices).html">Tsukasa</a> (Inner House Keeping Office) of Kunaisho (Ministry of the Sovereign's Household) both of which had the same official duties, as a part of administrative reforms. <h3>Officials</h3>
