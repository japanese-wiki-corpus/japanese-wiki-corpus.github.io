<h1>Tomei (Tang name) (唐名)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Tang names (tomei, tomyo, or karana) are Chinese names of government posts or departments each of which corresponds to a Japanese name of a government post or department whose official duties were similar to those of Tang under the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ritsuryo.html">ritsuryo</a> system (a system of centralized government based on the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ritsuryo.html">ritsuryo</a> code) in Japan. </p>
<p>In the early eighth century, in accordance with Taiho Ritsuryo Code and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yoro Ritsuryo Code.html">Yoro Ritsuryo Code</a>, the office organizations, as described below, after the establishment of the government-regulated <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ritsuryo.html">ritsuryo</a> system (Taiho Ritsuryo Code), were developed and official titles of all the officials were established. Around that time, Tang-style official titles and department names representing the same official duties were already used as a kind of elegant name, and when <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Nakamaro.html">FUJIWARA no Nakamaro</a>, who idolized the Tang culture, took control of the government, the titles of all the officials were translated into Tang names in 758. 
<br/>(Nakamaro himself had taken the title Shibirei [director general of Shibi institution] of the newly created Shibi chudai [office handling the principal empress Komyo's affairs], namely kotaigogushoku [<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Imperial Household Agency.html">Imperial Household Agency</a> officer assigned to the household of Queen Mother])<br/>
After Nakamaro fell from the position in 764, the titles were returned to the former names, however, the Tang name was often used as another name or an elegant name of the government post. Various <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Ryoge no kan (class outside of the Ritsuryo system).html">Ryoge no kan</a> (posts outside the original <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ritsuryo.html">Ritsuryo</a> code created by Imperial edicts), which were created from the late Nara period to the Heian period, had Tang names. 
<br/>(The <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Saga.html">Emperor Saga</a> who set the posts of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Ryoge no kan (class outside of the Ritsuryo system).html">Ryoge no kan</a> such as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kurodo no to (the name of a post).html">Kurodo no to</a> [Head Chamberlain] and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kebiishi (police and judicial chief).html">kebiishi</a> [officials with judicial and police powers] also idolized the Tang culture.)<br/>
</p>
<p>These Tang names do not completely match the office organizations originated in Chinese successive dynasties, so that they cannot be always replaced by one-to-one correspondence. Therefore, some organizations overlapped in using the Tang name; to the contrary, there were many cases in which a single organization had multiple Tang names. </p>
<p>Tang name was not used in a formal Iki (a letter of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Appointment (Ninkan).html">appointment</a>) in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Jimoku (ceremony for appointing officials).html">Jimoku</a> (ceremony for appointing officials) of Chotei (Imperial Court) and the like, however, often used in private documents such as letters, diaries, and Chinese-style poems. In the Edo period, Tang name was still continued as the elegant name attached to the Buke-kani (official court titles for <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a>), and even after the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ritsuryo.html">ritsuryo</a> system came to the end both in name and in reality by the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> restoration, it was taken over by attaching to the System of Departments of State in the early <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> era. </p>
<p>In 1885, the cabinet system was established, and even in this system, the tradition of Tang name was taken over, so that the prime minister was called 'shusho' and the foreign minister was called 'gaisho.'<br/>
Further, the Privy Council which was established together with the cabinet system was called 'sufu', the Chairman of the Privy Council was called 'susho', and both the Office of minister of the center and the minister of the center were called 'naifu', thus, this custom has been completely established in Japan. </p>
