<h1>Living National Treasure (人間国宝)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Living National Treasure is a Japanese popular term for individuals certified as Preservers of Important Intangible <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Cultural Properties.html">Cultural Properties</a> by the Minister of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology based on the Law for the Protection of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Cultural Properties.html">Cultural Properties</a>. The term "Living National Treasure" is not formally recognized by the law, but is an informal term used as a reference to cultural properties designated as the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/National Treasures (of Japan).html">National Treasures</a> of Japan. </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>Living National Treasure is a term for those designated as holders of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Important Intangible Cultural Property.html">Important Intangible Cultural Property</a>. Under the Law for Protection of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Cultural Properties.html">Cultural Properties</a>, intangible cultural properties are defined as dramatic, musical, artistic and other intangible cultural artifacts deemed as historically or artistically valuable to Japanese history (Article 2, Section 1, Part 2). <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Intangible cultural properties.html">Intangible cultural properties</a> of special importance are designated as "Important Intangible <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Cultural Properties.html">Cultural Properties</a>" by the Minister of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (Article 71, Section 1) (For further information, see the section on <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Important Intangible Cultural Property.html">Important Intangible Cultural Property</a>). In other words, intangible cultural property refers to certain 'art,' such as arts and crafts or performing arts. Individuals or groups have attained a high level of mastery in certain skills. Individuals or groups who have attained mastery in certain skills can be certified by the Japanese government as the preservers of their art and they receive support to ensure their continuation. <h3>Certification Methods</h3>
</p>
<p>There are three types of certifications for individuals or groups who hold important intangible cultural property: 'Individual Certification,' 'General Certification,' and 'Preservation Group Certification.'<br/>
Individual Certification is given to individual holders, General Certification is given to holders as an organized group, and Preservation Group Certification is given to the holders of a group. Within the three types of certification, those referred to as 'Living National Treasure' is generally limited to those holding Individual Certification. Those who are given General Certification or Preservation Group Certification are generally not referred to as a Living National Treasure. Individual Certification' and 'General Certification' prevails within the fields of performing arts, such as plays and music, while 'Individual Certification' and 'Preservation Group Certification' mainly occurs in the field of technical arts. </p>
<p>Individual Certification<br/>
Certification is given to 'individuals who are able to embody a performing art designated as an <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Important Intangible Cultural Property.html">Important Intangible Cultural Property</a> at the highest level,' or 'individuals who are a master of a technical art.'<br/>
</p>
<p>General Certification<br/>
Certification is given to 'two or more persons who are working together to embody a performing art at the highest level' or 'two or more persons who are a master of a technical art that shares certain characteristics.'<br/>
</p>
<p>Preservation Group Certification<br/>
Certification is given to a group of key members within all of the holders when 'the performing or technical art is not at all individualistic' and when 'there are many holders of the relevant performing or technical art.'<br/>
<h3>Support System</h3>
</p>
<p>In order to preserve important intangible cultural assets, the Japanese government provides a special annual subsidy of 2 million yen to Living <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/National Treasures (of Japan).html">National Treasures</a> (those with Individual Certification). In the case of groups, the government pays the costs of public exhibitions and successor training projects. The National Theater conducts training projects in order to foster successors to such arts as Nogaku (the art of Noh), <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Bunraku (Japanese puppet theater).html">Bunraku</a> (Japanese puppet theater) and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Kabuki.html">Kabuki</a> (traditional drama performed by male actors). <h3>List of Living <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/National Treasures (of Japan).html">National Treasures</a> (performing arts)</h3>
</p>
<p>The performing arts field consists of eight classes: <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Gagaku.html">Gagaku</a> (ancient Japanese court dance and music), Noh (traditional masked dance and drama), <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Bunraku (Japanese puppet theater).html">Bunraku</a>, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Kabuki.html">Kabuki</a>, Kumi Odori (combination dance), music, classical <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Japanese dance.html">Japanese dance</a> and entertainment. </p>
<p>General Certification in the field of performing arts<br/>
</p>
<p>Individual Certification is intended for the what they refer to as 'Living National Treasure,' or in other words, highly skilled 'masters' in their field. On the other hand, General Certification is intended for people who have the minimum level of skills required to maintain and pass down the entertainment rather than having high individual skills. For all practical purposes, the value of the two certifications are completely different. In General Certification, rather than being applied to only a few masters of an art, the form of entertainment or craft as a whole is considered to be certified. </p>
<p>For general certification of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Important Intangible Cultural Property.html">Important Intangible Cultural Property</a>, the following 11 groups are currently certified.
