<h1>Uji no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shaku.html">shaku</a> (氏爵)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Uji no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shaku.html">shaku</a> refers to conferring a rank of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Jugoi (Junior Fifth Rank) (a rank in Japan).html">Jugoi</a> (Junior Fifth Rank) on one person each annually from among persons ranked Shorokuinojo (Senior Sixth Rank, Upper Grade) in the O clan, Minamoto clan, Taira clan, Fujiwara clan, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/family/Tachibana clan.html">Tachibana clan</a> and others when the investiture was conducted on January 6 (old calendar) of every year from the Heian period. Since the conferment of Jugoinoge (Junior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade) was called joshaku (conferring a peerage), this was called uji no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shaku.html">shaku</a> as an annual promotion conducted to each clan. Its other name was uji no kyo. </p>
<p>As well as Oni no sei (the automatic promotion of the persons at the age of 21, whose parents were from Imperial Prince to the fifth rank, or whose grandparents were upper than third rank), uji no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shaku.html">shaku</a> was a privilege for powerful clans, and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Jimoku (ceremony for appointing officials).html">Jimoku</a> (ceremony for appointing officials) was held in accordance with a recommendation of uji no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Choja.html">choja</a> (the head of the clan). Each clan usually had more than one person ranked Shorokuinojo (Senior Sixth Rank, Upper Grade) at any time, and it is considered that a person trying to newly acquire a post of government official submitted a request called moshibumi (general term for a request or petition submitted by a lower authority to a higher) to uji no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Choja.html">choja</a>, and uji no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Choja.html">choja</a> selected an eligible person. In the first place, the authority of uji no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Choja.html">choja</a> was on a declining trend in the Heian period, and possessing influence on personnel affairs for the said clans under the system of uji no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shaku.html">shaku</a> resulted in restrengthening the authority of uji no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Choja.html">choja</a>. </p>
