<h1>Inshi/In no <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Tsukasa (a rank in government offices).html">tsukasa</a> (院司)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Inshi (or In no <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Tsukasa (a rank in government offices).html">tsukasa</a>) is an official of In no cho (Retired Emperor's Office) set up directly under the retired emperors and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Nyoin (a close female relative of the Emperor or a womwan of comparable standing).html">nyoin</a> (empress, empress dowager or grand empress dowager) during the ancient period to the middle ages in Japan. Generally mid-ranking aristocrats were appointed to Inshi concurrently with other Japanese official posts. As the cloister government started in the late Heian period, the post of Inshi in In no cho, a retired emperor's political organ, became an important post. </p>
<p>This section describes the details of the Inshi of the cloister government. </p>
<p><h3>Inshi in the cloister government</h3>
</p>
<p>The first case of Inshi was confirmed as In no betto (chief administrator of the Retired Emperor's Office) ABE no Yasuhito in 835, during the reign of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Saga.html">Emperor Saga</a>. At first, In no cho was established as a household agency for retired emperors and its main work consisted of trials dealing with land-related issues and with civil affairs. The ranks of Inshi were Betto (chief officer), Hogandai (deputy chief officer) and Sakandai (secretary). </p>
<p>When Emperor <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Shirakawa (the surroundings of the old capital, Kyoto).html">Shirakawa</a> started the cloister government around 1086, the role of inshi, which made up In no cho, became very important. Inshi issued letters and orders such as "in no cho kudashibumi" (a letter issued by in no cho), "in no cho cho" (orders issued by in no cho) and "<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Inzen (a decree from the retired Emperor).html">inzen</a>" (a decree from the retired Emperor) under the "Chiten no kimi" (the retired emperor in power) in order to carry out the cloister government. Therefore, practical government officials who held successively the position of Kurododokoro (the Chamberlain's Office), <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Benkan (Collective name of posts in Daijokan).html">benkan</a> (officials of the dajokan) and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Zuryo (The Head of The Provincial Governors).html">Zuryo</a> (the head of the provincial governors) often became inshi. Although they were not high-ranking aristocrats like Sekkan-ke (the families which produced regents) people, they had political influence because of their business ability. </p>
<p>Some inshi and other mid-ranking aristocrats became close advisors of the emperor and cloistered emperor with real power and wielded influence. They were called <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/In no Kinshin (the retired Emperors courtier).html">In no Kinshin</a> (the retired Emperor's courtier). Inshi and In no kinshin made various profits behind imperial power and they often received <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Chigyo-koku.html">chigyo-koku</a> (provincial fiefdom). One of the main reasons that <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/TAIRA no Kiyomori.html">TAIRA no Kiyomori</a> gained power quickly after the Hogen War, was that he was an Inshi of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Goshirakawa.html">Emperor Goshirakawa</a>. </p>
<p>Inshi had taken major roles in politics not only during the heights of the cloister government between Emperor <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Shirakawa (the surroundings of the old capital, Kyoto).html">Shirakawa</a> and Emperor Gotoba, but also until the beginning of the Muromachi period when the cloister government was extinguished (except certain period). <h3>Main posts</h3>
</p>
<p>In no betto: the highest officer of inshi<br/>
The first In no betto was MINAMIBUCHI no Nagakawa, who was appointed as the In no betto at the same time the Retired <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Saga.html">Emperor Saga</a> abdicated the throne. Generally, several persons were appointed as In no betto, and mostly <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Kugyo.html">Kugyo</a> (the top court officials) or <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Kurodo no to (the name of a post).html">Kurodo no to</a> (Head Chamberlain) who served the retired emperor during the reign as the emperor were appointed as In no betto. When <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Kugyo.html">Kugyo</a> was appointed as betto, it was called "<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Kugyo.html">Kugyo</a> betto", and when Shii (Fourth Rank) was appointed, it was called "Shii betto." During the reign of the retired Emperor <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Shirakawa (the surroundings of the old capital, Kyoto).html">Shirakawa</a>, one In no shitsushi (chief officer) was selected from <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Kugyo.html">Kugyo</a> bettos and one In no nenyo (one of the positions in In's office) was selected from Shii bettos to rule In no cho. Also, in the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period, the post of In no <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shikken (regent for the shogun).html">shikken</a> was added above In no shitsushi and In no nenyo and selected from <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Kugyo.html">Kugyo</a> bettos. </p>
<p>In hogandai : the second highest officer in inshi and assisted betto, conducted general affairs and signed official letters issued by In no cho. This position was set during the reign of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Uda.html">Emperor Uda</a>. During the reign of the Retired Emperor <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Shirakawa (the surroundings of the old capital, Kyoto).html">Shirakawa</a>, there were hogandai with Shii (fourth rank), however, usually one or two hogandai were selected from Goi (fifth rank) and four or five hogandai were selected from Rokui (sixth rank). </p>
<p>Inshutendai (secretary of the In no <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Tsukasa (a rank in government offices).html">tsukasa</a>, the third rank officer): their main works were such as document and record creation and management in In no cho and civil affairs under the betto and the hogandai. This position was set during the reign of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/Emperor Suzaku.html">Emperor Suzaku</a>. Two or three shutendai were selected from Rokui (sixth rank). In the reign of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Goshirakawa.html">Emperor Goshirakawa</a>, one "Cho no nenyo" which was the highest officer in In no cho (different post from In no nenyo) was selected. </p>
<p>Inkurodo (palace officer): this post was for the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Kurodo (Chamberlain).html">Kurodo</a> with the sixth rank who could not reach the post of Inshutendai even though they had served the retired emperor since his reign as emperor. According to "Shugaisho" (an ancient encyclopedia in 14c) the fixed number of places was four. According to the "<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Sankaiki.html">Sankaiki</a>" (<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Tadachika NAKAYAMA.html">Tadachika NAKAYAMA</a>'s diary) <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/MINAMOTO no Yoritomo.html">MINAMOTO no Yoritomo</a> who was Sahyoe no jo (third-ranked officer of Sahyoe-fu, the Left Division of Middle Palace Guards) was appointed as Inkurodo of Josaimonin (<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Nyoin (a close female relative of the Emperor or a womwan of comparable standing).html">nyoin</a> (a close female relative of the Emperor or a womwan of comparable standing)) on February 19, 1159 (old calendar). </p>
<p>Indenso (introducing officer): they were in charge of relaying various messages to the retired emperor. As the first Indenso, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Tsunefusa YOSHIDA.html">Tsunefusa YOSHIDA</a> and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/TAKASHINA no Yasutsune.html">TAKASHINA no Yasutsune</a> during the reign of the Retired <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Goshirakawa.html">Emperor Goshirakawa</a> were confirmed. This post functioned in reality after <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Gosaga.html">Emperor Gosaga</a> appointed Tametsune YOSHIDA and Sadatsugu HAMURO in 1246 and they were in charge of all messages except <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Kanto moshitsugi.html">Kanto moshitsugi</a> (adjusting works between the retired emperor and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>). During the reign of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Kameyama.html">Emperor Kameyama</a>, in 1279, six members of Indenso were divided into three pairs and each pair worked in rotation. Buke tenso (liaison officers between the imperial court and the military government) was derived from Indenso. During the Edo period, incumbent or predecessor <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Dainagon (chief councilor of state).html">dainagon</a> (chief councilor of state) and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Chunagon.html">chunagon</a> (vice-councilor of state) were appointed as Indenso and Buke tenso concurrently. </p>
<p>Inmizuijin (palace guard): they worked as guard for the retired emperor and his palace. Mostly, they were selected from <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Konoefu (Headquarters of the Inner Palace Guards).html">Konoefu</a> (division of Inner Palace Guards). The new emperor gave fuko (Residential units (ko) assigned as prebends (fu) to support top-ranking officials, temples, shrines, and royal households such as those of the queen-consort and crown prince) and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Zuijin.html">zuijin</a> (guard) to the retired emperor as well as a title of respect. The fixed number of places was five each (later six each) from Sayu <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Konoefu (Headquarters of the Inner Palace Guards).html">Konoefu</a> (the left and right divisions of the Inner Palace Guards). When the retired emperor entered the priesthood and became a cloistered emperor, he returned zuijins as a sign of renouncing the world. However, each <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Zuijin.html">zuijin</a> with the rank of Konoe <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Shoso (public repository).html">shoso</a> (fourth rank officer in palace guard division) from the Left and Right divisions of palace guards stayed in the cloistered imperial agency as officials. </p>
