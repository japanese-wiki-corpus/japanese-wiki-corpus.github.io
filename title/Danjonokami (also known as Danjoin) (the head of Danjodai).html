<p></p>
<p>Danjonokami (also known as Danjoin) was the head of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Danjodai (Board of Censors).html">Danjodai</a> under the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ritsuryo.html">ritsuryo</a> legal code system. The corresponding court rank was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Jusanmi.html">Jusanmi</a> (Junior Third Rank). It took charge of censuring and impeaching violations of the law. Its office <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Danjodai (Board of Censors).html">Danjodai</a> became independent of the two departments and eight ministries to be in charge of prosecution. It mainly engaged in investigating and arresting all the officials who violated the law except for Dajodaijin. </p>
<p>After the police and judicial chief <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kebiishi (police and judicial chief).html">Kebiishi</a>, which was not originally specified in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ritsuryo.html">ritsuryo</a> system, was established in the early ninth century during the Heian period, Danjonokami became an honorary post given to the Imperial family member with little authority. </p>
