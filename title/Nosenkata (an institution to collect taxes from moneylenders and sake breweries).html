<h1>Nosenkata (an institution to collect taxes from moneylenders and sake breweries) (納銭方)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The Nosenkata was an organization commissioned to collect the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Dosoyaku (tax for doso).html">dosoyaku</a> (taxes imposed on pawnbrokers and moneylenders by the Muromachi <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> - Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>) and sakayayaku (taxes imposed on sake brewery by the Muromachi <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>), whose members were appointed by the Muromachi <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> from among influential figures belonging to the doso (pawnbrokers and moneylenders) or the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Sakaya.html">sakaya</a> (sake breweries). </p>
<p><h3>Taxation on the doso and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Sakaya.html">sakaya</a> by the Muromachi <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a></h3>
</p>
<p>In <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, the doso and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Sakaya.html">sakaya</a> had developed rapidly since the latter part of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period. Leading Buddhist temples such as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Enryaku-ji Temple.html">Enryaku-ji Temple</a>, as well as the miki no kami (Chief of the Sake Office, the Oshikoji family took charge for generations) in the Imperial Court, had collected taxes from the doso and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Sakaya.html">sakaya</a> by dominating them. </p>
<p>The Muromachi <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>, established in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, had originally put its financial base on the income from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Goryosho.html">goryosho</a> (land owned by the Emperor or <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>) and others, however, the financial base gradually scaled down with the occupation of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Goryosho.html">goryosho</a> from the Southern Court (Japan) during the period of the Northern and Southern Courts (Japan) and with the appropriation of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Goryosho.html">goryosho</a> for rewards allocated to their military commanders. Therefore, the Muromachi <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> tried to cover the financial shortage by collecting taxes from the doso and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Sakaya.html">sakaya</a>, and started to exclude the clout of other influential families using the military force employed for keeping the peace in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> city. In 1371, during the third Seii taishogun <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshimitsu ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshimitsu ASHIKAGA</a>'s service, the Muromachi <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> collected the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Dosoyaku (tax for doso).html">dosoyaku</a> from the doso in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> to supplement various expenses needed for <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Emperor Gokogon.html">Emperor Gokogon</a>'s abdication, and in 1393, the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> issued an ordinance comprised of five rules regarding doso and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Sakaya.html">sakaya</a> in and around Rakuchu (inside the capital <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>). By this ordinance, the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> prohibited the influential families from collecting taxes from the doso and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Sakaya.html">sakaya</a>, except for such taxes as the miki no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Tsukasa (a rank in government offices).html">tsukasa</a> paid to the Court, instead, the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> imposed an annual payment of 6,000 kan on the doso and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Sakaya.html">sakaya</a>. <h3>Establishment of the Nosenkata</h3>
</p>
<p>Dominating the doso and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Sakaya.html">sakaya</a>, the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> initially tried to collect taxes directly from individual traders, but their efficiency was poor. Therefore, the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> adopted a new policy; the 'shuchu' (leading figures among individual traders) takes responsibility in collecting taxes from every tens of traders on behalf of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>, and pays income generated by the taxation to the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>. The person responsible was Nosenkata. There were two groups of shuchu in the Nosenkata, one was a group belonged to the doso, which collected the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Dosoyaku (tax for doso).html">dosoyaku</a> commensurate with the number of pawns for the mortgage, and the other was a group belonging to the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Sakaya.html">sakaya</a>, which collected the sakayayaku commensurate with the number of jars for brewing. While the existence of the priest-styled Nosenkata using the Buddhist title and the Nosenkata using a popular name is suggested in a record, the doso had originally been put under the control of temples such as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Enryaku-ji Temple.html">Enryaku-ji Temple</a>, therefore the Buddhist title is regarded as the remains of their work style as priest belonging to the Buddhist temples. Reflecting the importance of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Dosoyaku (tax for doso).html">dosoyaku</a> and sakayayaku on the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> finance in those days, the word "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Goryosho.html">goryosho</a>" was often used for the Nosenkata, though the "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Goryosho.html">goryosho</a>" originally indicated the territory directly controlled by the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>. </p>
<p>Some doso in the Nosenkata were appointed to the officer of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kubo-okura (financial branch).html">Kubo-okura</a> (finance branch). Originally, there was a post called kurabugyo in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>, which had managed the property and documents belonging to the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>, however, in the light of the labor involved in shipment and security, some Nosenkata took charge not only of taxation but also of business relating to revenue and expenditure for the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> finance. As a result, the kurabugyo was scaled down to deal with only restricted duties such as collecting taxes from specific traders who were approved to pay taxes directly to the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>, managing special accounts including 'Zodairitobetsu' (building expenses for the Imperial Palace) and dealing with a small amount of revenue and expenditure. <h3><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Tokuseirei.html">Tokuseirei</a> (ordering the return of land sold and the dissolution of debts) and fiscal reconstruction</h3>
</p>
<p>There had been drastic changes since the period of the sixth <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshinori ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshinori ASHIKAGA</a>. Whenever the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Tokuseirei.html">Tokuseirei</a> was issued after peasant uprisings, the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> had to exempt the seriously damaged doso from the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Dosoyaku (tax for doso).html">dosoyaku</a> payment to save them. As a result, the income from the Nosenkata fell into arrears and the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>'s daily life was threatened. Therefore, the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> allowed the Nosenkata to form a za (guild) called 'Nosendokoro <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Kaisho (the early-modern times).html">kaisho</a>' (meeting place for the Nosenkata) aiming to establish a cooperative system among the Nosenkata, and restricted the free trade and free closure of the doso and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Sakaya.html">sakaya</a> by strengthening the bakufu-led protection and supervising systems. Moreover, the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> introduced the Bunichi Tokusei (borrowers are exempted from returning money to the doso and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Sakaya.html">sakaya</a> if they paid 10 to 20% of their debts to the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>) to impose a fee on the procedure for the issue of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Tokuseirei.html">Tokuseirei</a>, and set up the bajoyaku (taxes imposed on the fermented soybean paste manufacturers, public bath managers and others), as well as introduced a contract system giving privileges to the Nosenkata under the condition that they paid the taxes in advance. Consequently, it is believed that the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> finance was kept comparatively stable until immediately before the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Onin War.html">Onin War</a> despite losing its authority. <h3>Decline of the Muromachi <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> and the Nosenkata</h3>
</p>
<p>After the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Onin War.html">Onin War</a>, with the devastation of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> city and refusal of tax payment, the tax income did not reach the expected income calculated on the basis of the contract system, and as a result the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> finances went into the red. In addition, not a few people refused to be a Nosenkata. As a countermeasure, the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> tried to curb the tax revenue decrease by imposing a tax on the'請酒' (sake retailer) and 'hizeniya' (new money-lender which lends money at a high interest rate with daily interest), however the tax revenue was not restored. When <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kanrei.html">Kanrei</a> (shogunal deputy) <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Harumoto HOSOKAWA.html">Harumoto HOSOKAWA</a> decided in 1539 to leave the monopolistic contract for the Nosenkata business entirely to 'Shojitsubo' (a doso of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/shrines/Enryaku-ji Temple.html">Enryaku-ji Temple</a> extraction), which had repeatedly taken charge of Nosenkata and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kubo-okura (financial branch).html">Kubo-okura</a>, as a measure against the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Dosoyaku (tax for doso).html">dosoyaku</a> and sakayayaku decrease due to the damage from the Tenbun Hokke War, the doso and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Sakaya.html">sakaya</a> strongly opposed his decision and requested direct tax payment to the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>. Harumoto however refused their request. In 1552, demanding the same privileges as 'Shojitsubo,' 'Gyokusenbo,' a long-established doso similar to 'Shojitsubo,' filed a lawsuit only to lose. While the Nosenkata was abolished along with the dissolution of the Muromachi <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> in 1573, the system of Nosenkata is thought to be absorbed by the Oda administration, because Shojitsubo Joun, the family head of Shojitsubo at that time, was continuously appointed by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Nobunaga ODA.html">Nobunaga ODA</a> to the post for collecting taxes. </p>
