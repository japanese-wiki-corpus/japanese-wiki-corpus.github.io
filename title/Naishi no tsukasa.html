<h1><a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Naishi.html">Naishi</a> no <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Tsukasa (a rank in government offices).html">tsukasa</a> (内侍司)</h1>
<p></p>
<p><a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Naishi.html">Naishi</a> no <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Tsukasa (a rank in government offices).html">tsukasa</a> was one of the cutcherry in government-regulated organizations in Japan. It was one of the 12 offices belonging to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Kokyu (empresss residence).html">kokyu</a>, empress's residence fixed by Ryo code (administrative laws) and consisted of only court ladies. </p>
<p><h3>Official Duties</h3>
</p>
<p>Court ladies in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Naishi.html">Naishi</a> no <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Tsukasa (a rank in government offices).html">tsukasa</a> served the emperor closely and dealt with affairs like introducing messages, transmitting imperial orders and managing imperial formal events. This position was a kind of emperor's secretary and talented ladies who were well versed in academics and etiquette were appointed. </p>
<p>The divine mirror, which was modeled after <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Shinto/Yata no Kagami.html">Yata no Kagami</a> (the eight-span mirror; one of the Imperial regalia) as one of the three sacred imperial treasures, was kept in Unmeiden (Naishidokoro), therefore, court ladies in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Naishi.html">Naishi</a> no <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Tsukasa (a rank in government offices).html">tsukasa</a> had to protect and keep the mirror. 
<br/>Thus, this divine mirror was called 'Naishidokoro.'<br/>
<h3>Rank</h3>
</p>
<p>The rank of court ladies in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Naishi.html">Naishi</a> no <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Tsukasa (a rank in government offices).html">tsukasa</a> was not so high according to the rule of Ryo. But little by little, their official duties became important and the rank became much higher during the reign of Emperor Heizei in 807. That was one of the causes of the Kusuko Incident. </p>
<p>After the mid Heian period, structure of the 12 offices belonging to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Kokyu (empresss residence).html">kokyu</a> was reorganized and the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Naishi.html">Naishi</a> no <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Tsukasa (a rank in government offices).html">tsukasa</a> became only one practical official in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Kokyu (empresss residence).html">kokyu</a>. <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Naishi no kami.html">Naishi no kami</a>/<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Shoji (Paper Sliding Screen).html">shoji</a>, a chief of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Naishi.html">Naishi</a> no <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Tsukasa (a rank in government offices).html">tsukasa</a> was treated almost as an empress, and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Naishi no suke (a court lady of the first rank).html">Naishi no suke</a> who was a deputy chief had the characteristics of an emperor's concubine. <h3><a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Naishi no kami.html">Naishi no kami</a>/<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Shoji (Paper Sliding Screen).html">shoji</a></h3>
</p>
<p>Chief of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Naishi.html">Naishi</a> no <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Tsukasa (a rank in government offices).html">tsukasa</a><br/>
The official rank of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Naishi no kami.html">Naishi no kami</a> was <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Jugoi (Junior Fifth Rank) (a rank in Japan).html">Jugoi</a> (Junior Fifth Rank), then upgraded to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Jusanmi.html">Jusanmi</a> (Junior Third Rank). The prescribed number was two. Mostly daughters of Sekkan-ke (the families which produced regents) were selected. Originally, only <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Naishi no kami.html">Naishi no kami</a> could deal with the official duties such as introducing messages and transmitting imperial orders, and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Naishi no suke (a court lady of the first rank).html">Naishi no suke</a> and other lower ranked court ladies could not deal with them. </p>
<p>Later, as <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Naishi no kami.html">Naishi no kami</a> was treated almost as an empress, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Naishi no suke (a court lady of the first rank).html">Naishi no suke</a> and the lower ranked court ladies dealt with the actual duties. Between the late Heian and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> periods, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Naishi no kami.html">Naishi no kami</a> was not appointed. <h3><a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Naishi.html">Naishi</a> no suke/Tenji</h3>

The prescribed number was four. Mostly daughters of court nobles such as <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Dainagon (chief councilor of state).html">dainagon</a> (chief councilor of state) and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Chunagon.html">chunagon</a> (vice-councilor of state) were selected. <h3><a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Naishi.html">Naishi</a> no jo/<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Shoji (Paper Sliding Screen).html">Shoji</a></h3>
</p>
<p>The third ranked officials<br/>
Official rank of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Naishi.html">Naishi</a> no jo was Jushichii (Junior Seventh Rank), then upgraded to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Jugoi (Junior Fifth Rank) (a rank in Japan).html">Jugoi</a> (Junior Fifth Rank). The prescribed number was six, consisting of four regular officials and two irregular officials. Normally, '<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Naishi.html">Naishi</a>' means <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Naishi.html">Naishi</a> no jo. </p>
<p><a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Naishi.html">Naishi</a> no jo for joro (high rank female servant in the Imperial Court) with the First Rank was called '<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Koto no naishi.html">Koto no naishi</a>' or 'Nagahashi no tsubone.'<br/>
They always served for emperors and were in charge of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Naishi no kami.html">Naishi no kami</a>'s roles such as introducing messages and transmitting imperial orders, and transmitted the official orders to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Kurodo (Chamberlain).html">Kurodo</a> (Chamberlain). After <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Naishi no kami.html">Naishi no kami</a> and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Naishi no suke (a court lady of the first rank).html">Naishi no suke</a> became a mere facade, actual roles of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Naishi.html">Naishi</a> no <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Tsukasa (a rank in government offices).html">tsukasa</a> were pursued centering on <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Koto no naishi.html">Koto no naishi</a>. Koto no <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Naishi.html">naishi</a> had more power than daitenji, who was a high rank woman servent in the Imperial Court, externally during the Edo period. <h3>Nyoju</h3>
</p>
<p>Nyoju was a lower ranked court lady in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Naishi.html">Naishi</a> no <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Tsukasa (a rank in government offices).html">tsukasa</a>.
