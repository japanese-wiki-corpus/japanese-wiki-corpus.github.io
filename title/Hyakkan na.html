<h1>Hyakkan na (百官名)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Hyakkan na refers to an official-rank-style name that <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> called himself. </p>
<p>After the Muromachi period, there appeared some cases in which <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a>, which were Japanese provincial military governors, that became <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a>, which were Japanese feudal lords) issued written appointments to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Hikan (low ranking clerks).html">hikan</a> (a low-level bureaucrat) and gave them <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Zuryomei (Honorary titles).html">zuryomei</a> (an official title of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kokushi.html">kokushi</a>, provincial governor), which were unjustified titlles the Imperial Court had nothing to do with. Therefore, in formal occasions, such official names of the government office as given by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> were omitted or replaced by different names. Also there appeared other cases in which offspring succeeded government posts which their ancestors had been appointed to, and thus a new custom of jikan, in which <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> used a government post at his own initiative without permission from the Imperial Court, became established. </p>
<p>Since around the Sengoku period (period of warring states) (Japan), a custom in which <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> used a name without his government post as his own name occurred among the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> class, and continued by the end of the Edo period. This was developed into azuma hyakkan (eastern-style titles conferred on <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a>) in the Kanto area (Eastern part of Japan) and was called buke hyakkan (titles conferred on <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a>), while hyakkan na based on government posts was called kuge hyakkan (titles conferred on <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> warriors based on the official names). <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">Samurai</a> used hyakkan na putting it after the name of his clan or surname, and before his imina (a personal name) (In Japan a surname comes first, and followed by a first name). </p>
<p>Reading of hyakkan na is a little different from that of the official name of a government post, so it is necessary to be careful (for example, 蔵人(Chamberlain) is read "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kurodo (Chamberlain).html">kurodo</a>" for a government post, but "kurando" for hyakkan na). </p>
