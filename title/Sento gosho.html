<p></p>
<p>"<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Sento.html">Sento</a> gosho" is the imperial palace of an abdicated emperor (retired or cloistered emperor). 
<br/><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Sento.html">Sento</a> originally refers to the residence of mountain hermits and is also read as 'sendo.'<br/>
This, in turn, came to mean the imperial palace of an abdicated emperor (retired emperor or cloistered emperor), it was then also used as a synonym for a retired or cloistered emperor. </p>
<p>Mountain hermit is an idealized human figure, believed in China since ancient times, and because he lives secluded deep in the mountains, away from this world, it was used as a word praising the residence of abdicated emperors. 
<br/>Since the residence of noblemen are called 'gosho,' it was called '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Sento.html">sento</a> gosho.'<br/>
Retired and cloistered emperors typically retired from the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Dairi (the Imperial palace).html">dairi</a> (Imperial Palace) and moved to the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Sento.html">sento</a> gosho after abdicating, and the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Satodairi (temporary imperial palace).html">satodairi</a> (a temporary palace) was often used for this purpose. <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Sento.html">Sento</a> gosho was also called 'in,' and this was also used as a synonym for retired and cloistered emperors. At the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Sento.html">sento</a> gosho, innocho (Retired Emperor's Office), an agency for the household, was placed, as well as '<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Hokumen no bushi (the Imperial Palace Guards for the north side).html">Hokumen no bushi</a> (the Imperial Palace Guards for the north side) and later, Saimen no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bushi.html">bushi</a> (the Imperial Palace Guards for the west side), as imperial guards for Emperor <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Shirakawa (the surroundings of the old capital, Kyoto).html">Shirakawa</a>. </p>
