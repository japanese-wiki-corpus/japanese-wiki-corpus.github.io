<h1>Sento gosho (仙洞御所)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>"Sento gosho" is the imperial palace of an abdicated emperor (retired or cloistered emperor). 
<br/>Sento originally refers to the residence of mountain hermits and is also read as 'sendo.'<br/>
This, in turn, came to mean the imperial palace of an abdicated emperor (retired emperor or cloistered emperor), it was then also used as a synonym for a retired or cloistered emperor. </p>
<p>Mountain hermit is an idealized human figure, believed in China since ancient times, and because he lives secluded deep in the mountains, away from this world, it was used as a word praising the residence of abdicated emperors. 
<br/>Since the residence of noblemen are called 'gosho,' it was called 'sento gosho.'<br/>
Retired and cloistered emperors typically retired from the dairi (Imperial Palace) and moved to the sento gosho after abdicating, and the satodairi (a temporary palace) was often used for this purpose. Sento gosho was also called 'in,' and this was also used as a synonym for retired and cloistered emperors. At the sento gosho, innocho (Retired Emperor's Office), an agency for the household, was placed, as well as 'Hokumen no bushi (the Imperial Palace Guards for the north side) and later, Saimen no bushi (the Imperial Palace Guards for the west side), as imperial guards for Emperor Shirakawa. </p>

<p>Today, in the Kyoto Imperial Garden in Kyoto City, sento gosho is located southeast of the Kyoto Imperial Palace,<br/>
This was built in 1627 for Emperor Gomizunoo, and its official name is Sakuramachiden. A garden landscaped by Enshu KOBORI stretches. The buildings of the sento gosho were not rebuilt after the fire in 1854, and only the garden remains today. The Omiya gosho lying northeast of the sento gosho was originally built as the nyoin gosho (imperial palace of close female relatives of the emperor or a woman of comparable standing) for Tofukumonin, who was the chugu (wife of an emperor) of Emperor Gomizunoo. </p>
