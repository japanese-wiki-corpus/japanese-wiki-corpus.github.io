<h1>Kannin (officials) (官人)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kannin (also known as Kanjin, Tsukasabito) means an official and a civil servant. </p>
<p>In the ritsuryo system, Kannin meant officials at the rank of Sakan of Tsukasa (also known as Shi) or above and the court rank of Sixth Rank or below, and in the Heian period, it meant officials at the rank of Jo or below, specifically lieutenant of Konoefu (the Headquarters of the Inner Palace Guards) or under. </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>In a narrow sense, Kannin means the officials of Shitokan and the officials at the government posts of Honkan, both of which had corresponding court ranks, except for Gunji; and in a broad sense, Kannin collectively means the officials including Gunji and officials without corresponding court ranks such as Tukaibe, Tomobe, and Toneri. In some cases, among the above definition, those at Junior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade (Fifth Rank) or above may be called the nobles and only those below that court rank may be called Kannin. In that case, as Sanni did not hold the posts of Shitokan or Honkan even when they were at Fifth Rank or above, they were sometimes treated accordingly as Kanjin. </p>
<p>Kannin at Eighth Rank or above were exempted from Soyocho, Yo, and Zoyo, and treated favorably in punishment. Kannin at Fifth Rank or above had privileges of Onni to receive court ranks for their family members, and of receiving paddy fields and the like; and those at higher court ranks had bigger privileges. Apart from them, high-ranking government post holders also had similar privileges. Also Kannin at Initial Rank or below were treated favorably in taxation to some extent. <h3>Bukan (Military officers) and Bunkan (Civil officers)</h3>

Bunkan was the civil servant other than Bukan. Only Kannin at Dazaifu and Udoneri, who bore swords, were treated as Bunkan, not Bunkan. Personnel affairs of Bunkan was undertaken by Hyobusho and personnel affairs of Bukan was undertaken by Shikibusho. <h3>Kyokan and Gekan</h3>
