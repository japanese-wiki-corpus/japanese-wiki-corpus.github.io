<p></p>
<p>Kannin (also known as <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Kanjin.html">Kanjin</a>, Tsukasabito) means an official and a civil servant. </p>
<p>In the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Ritsuryo.html">ritsuryo</a> system, Kannin meant officials at the rank of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Sakan (Kokushi).html">Sakan</a> of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Tsukasa (a rank in government offices).html">Tsukasa</a> (also known as Shi) or above and the court rank of Sixth Rank or below, and in the Heian period, it meant officials at the rank of Jo or below, specifically lieutenant of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Konoefu (Headquarters of the Inner Palace Guards).html">Konoefu</a> (the Headquarters of the Inner Palace Guards) or under. </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>In a narrow sense, Kannin means the officials of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Shitokan (four classifications of bureaucrats ranks).html">Shitokan</a> and the officials at the government posts of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Honkan.html">Honkan</a>, both of which had corresponding court ranks, except for <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Gunji.html">Gunji</a>; and in a broad sense, Kannin collectively means the officials including <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Gunji.html">Gunji</a> and officials without corresponding court ranks such as Tukaibe, Tomobe, and Toneri. In some cases, among the above definition, those at Junior Fifth Rank, Lower Grade (Fifth Rank) or above may be called the nobles and only those below that court rank may be called Kannin. In that case, as Sanni did not hold the posts of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Shitokan (four classifications of bureaucrats ranks).html">Shitokan</a> or <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Honkan.html">Honkan</a> even when they were at Fifth Rank or above, they were sometimes treated accordingly as <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Kanjin.html">Kanjin</a>. </p>
