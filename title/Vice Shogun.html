<p>Vice <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> is the post of military officer which was ranked the next position of "Dai <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> (the great general)" or <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> in Japan. Under the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Ritsuryo.html">Ritsuryo</a> system, ranking in order of Dai <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>, vice <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> was stipulated, however, in fact, vice <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> was directly placed to Dai <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>, eliminating <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>. Moreover, there was government post as adjutant, a vice-Fukushogun (Vice-Shogun). </p>
<p>Vice <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> under the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Ritsuryo.html">Ritsuryo</a> system (a system of centralized government based on the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Ritsuryo.html">ritsuryo</a> code)<br/>
Under the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Ritsuryo.html">Ritsuryo</a> system in Japan, there was stipulations concerning vice <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> in Article 24 of Gunboryo (the Statute on Military Defense). According to this, when a commander went to fight, if the number of soldiers was more than 10,000, one <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> and two vice <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> were supposed to be placed. And, Dai <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> was placed in every three troops. In fact, against the stipulations, one to a few vice <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> were appointed. And, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> was never placed under Dai <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> but vice <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> was directly placed under Dai <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>. In the history book, vice <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> is also written as "Vice Commander" (the Chinese character of commander used in the book had almost the same meaning as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>). </p>
<p>For example, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/OTOMO no Otomaro.html">OTOMO no Otomaro</a> was appointed as Seito vice <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> in February, 784. This <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Appointment (Ninkan).html">appointment</a> of vice <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> was done before the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Appointment (Ninkan).html">appointment</a> of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>, a commander in chief of the army to subdue the eastern barbarians, and next year of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Appointment (Ninkan).html">appointment</a> of vice <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/OTOMO no Yakamochi.html">OTOMO no Yakamochi</a> was appointed as Jisetsu Seito <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> (the general of conquering east-barbarians) and sent punitive force of Ezo. In addition, it is well known that <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/SAKANOUE no Tamuramaro.html">SAKANOUE no Tamuramaro</a> was appointed as Seii vice <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> on February 5, 794 as the adjutant for <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/OTOMO no Otomaro.html">OTOMO no Otomaro</a>, Seii taishogun (Seii great <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>, literally, "great general who subdues the barbarians") who was dispatched to conquer Ezo in Ou by the Imperial Court. Vice-Fukushogun was placed under vice <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>. Then, in 811, after <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/FUNYA no Watamaro.html">FUNYA no Watamaro</a> was appointed as seii <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> (great general who subdues the barbarians), OTOMO no Imando, SAEKI no Mimimaro and SAKANOUE no Takakai received an official <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Appointment (Ninkan).html">appointment</a> as vice <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>. In 815, ONO no Himi was appointed as seito vice shogun Mutsu no suke (vice <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> who subdues the eastern barbarians, and assistant governor of Mutsu Province); like this, appointments of vice <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> for the sake of conquest of Ezo in Ou were done several times. </p>
<p>With an end of conquest of ezo and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Appointment (Ninkan).html">appointment</a> of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daishogun (Command in Chief).html">Daishogun</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Appointment (Ninkan).html">appointment</a> of vice <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> had became rare. In mid Heian period, there is a written record that <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Tsunemoto.html">MINAMOTO no Tsunemoto</a> was appointed as Seii vice <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> during the Johei and Tengyo War on March 19, 940. After <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Yoritomo.html">MINAMOTO no Yoritomo</a> became seii taishogun and established <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>) and formed military government, there was almost no one who was appointed as vice <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> and in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period there was no one who was appointed as vice <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>. </p>
<p>Vice <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> in Muromachi period<br/>
In Muromachi period, vice <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> was not permanent, but appointed once or twice. </p>
<p>In 1338, the early Muromachi period, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Tadayoshi ASHIKAGA.html">Tadayoshi ASHIKAGA</a>, younger brother of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Takauji ASHIKAGA.html">Takauji ASHIKAGA</a> was appointed as Seii fukushogun. And also, there is a written record that <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Norimasa IMAGAWA.html">Norimasa IMAGAWA</a>, who played a role in quelling War of Zenshu UESUGI, was appointed as vice <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>. </p>
<p>In the late Muromachi period, Koga kubo Ashikaga Clan boasted authority over Kanto <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">Samurai</a> in Kanto region, then Yoshiaki Ashikaga from the same clan proclaimed himself Oyumi kubo in rivalry with Koga kubo's father and son, Takamoto ASHIKAGA and Haruuji ASHIKAGA. At this time, Satomi clan, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> in the Sengoku period proclaimed himself as Kanto vice <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>, following Yoshiaki. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Appointment (Ninkan).html">Appointment</a> by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshiaki ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshiaki ASHIKAGA</a><br/>
On August, 1568, there is a written record that the fifteenth <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshiaki ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshiaki ASHIKAGA</a> asked <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Nobunaga ODA.html">Nobunaga ODA</a>, who performed great deeds for Yoshiaki's assumption of the post of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>, to serve as vice <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> or administrative post. However, it is said that Nobunaga declined this offer. After Yoshiaki and Nobunaga were opposed to each other, Yoshiaki asked <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Ieyasu TOKUGAWA.html">Ieyasu TOKUGAWA</a>, an ally of Nobunaga, to become the vice <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> in order to win him to Yoshiaki's side, but it is said that Ieyasu declined this offer. </p>
<p>After Yoshiaki was expelled from <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> by Nobunaga and came under the patronage of Mori clan in Tomo, Bingo Province, he appointed Terumoto Mori as vice <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> and tried to re-establish Muromachi <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> in Tomo. Although Nobunaga was killed by rebellion of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Mitsuhide AKECHI.html">Mitsuhide AKECHI</a>, the ruling power was shifted to the hand of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI.html">Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI</a>, and Yoshiaki was not able to re-establish Muromachi <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>. </p>
<p>Vice <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> in Edo period<br/>
</p>
<p>After the death of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI.html">Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Ieyasu TOKUGAWA.html">Ieyasu TOKUGAWA</a> who won The Battle of Sekigahara was appointed as seii taishogun and established <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Edo bakufu.html">Edo bakufu</a>, however, the post "vice <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>" was not placed, therefore, no one was appointed as vice <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> in Edo period. </p>
<p>However, the lord of the Mito Domain, one of the Tokugawa gosanke (three privileged branches of Tokugawa family) is often called as a vice <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> in the world or vice <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> in Mito. Status of the lord of Mito Domain was different from other <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> (Japanese feudal lords), and they were required to Jofu (a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">Daimyo</a> feudal lord's retainer who remained permanently in the Edo with the lord's and their own family in the Edo period) in stead of Sankinkotai (a system under which feudal lords in the Edo period were required to spend every other year in residence in Edo) and they were more likely to be the assistant for <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>. For these reasons, it is said that the lord of Mito Domain became to be called the vice <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>. </p>
<p>This is not an official but familiar name, that was named by the fact written above. Since the lord of Mito Domain was in such an unique status, the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> half approved this familiar name, and for example, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> didn't crack down on Kodanshi, professional storytellers in Edo called Mitukuni TOKUGAWA "world-famous vice <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>." These theories are still believed to be common saying, but feudal retainers of Mito Domain at that time strongly believed these stories. Unlike other Tokugawa gosanke (three privileged branches of Tokugawa family), the Owari-Tokugawa family and the Kishu-Tokugawa family, the Mito-Tokugawa family was not allowed to produce an heir at the time of extinction of the shogunate family, and official court rank was low status, Gon <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Chunagon.html">Chunagon</a> (a provisional vice-councilor of state), and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kokudaka (The Figure Of Land Productivity).html">kokudaka</a> (crop yield) was two hundred thousands Goku crop yields smaller than others. Instead, as the Mito-Tokugawa family was held in high esteem as the assistant for <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>, Kodanshi, professional storyteller told that the Mito-Tokugawa family was the world famous vice <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>. </p>
<p>At any rate, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Taisei Hokan (transfer of power back to the Emperor).html">Taisei Hokan</a> (transfer of power back to the Emperor) was done by Yoshinobu TOKUGAWA from the Mito-Tokugawa family itself, and post and naming of vice <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> was completely abolished with the end of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Edo bakufu.html">Edo bakufu</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> government. </p>
<p>"Vice <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>" today<br/>
In the period drama "Mito <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Komon.html">Komon</a>", which depicts Mitukuni TOKUGAWA's journey through various districts in the nation on the basis of the fact that the head of Mito-Tokugawa family, one of the gosanke, was called "the world famous vice-shogun" although it was common saying, he was portrayed as "world famous vice <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>" and "former vice <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>" (because he resigned his post and was retired). </p>
<p>The popularity of this drama has made people identify Mitukuni TOKUGAWA with the world famous vice <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>, causing a misunderstanding that he was officially appointed as the vice <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> or the post of vice <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> was officially established in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Edo bakufu.html">Edo bakufu</a>. Today, at each city, town and village in Ibaraki Prefecture including Mito City where was old territorial land of the Mito Domain, jizake (local sake) and local product named "vice <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>" are sold in connection with <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Mitsukuni TOKUGAWA.html">Mitsukuni TOKUGAWA</a>, and the naming "vice <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> in Mito" is used as one of the brand. </p>
