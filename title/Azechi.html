<p>Azechi (in the Ritsuryo system)<br/>
Azechi was a government post of Ryoge no kan to supervise local government. From kokushu (head of provincial governors) of several provinces, one person was selected to supervise the administration of kokushi (provincial governors) within its jurisdiction. </p>
<p>It was established in 719 of the Nara period. After the Heian period, except for the Azechi in Mutsu Province and Dewa Province, the post was held concurrently with Nagon (Dainagon [chief councilor of state], Chunagon [vice-councilor of state], Shonagon [lesser councilor of state]), Sangi (councillor) and so on, making the post unsubstantial. </p>
<p><h3>Persons who were first appointed as Azechi</h3>
</p>
<p>According to the "Shoku Nihongi" (Chronicle of Japan Continued), the following eleven persons in the position of kokushi were appointed as Azechi for the first time on July 13, 719, of the early Nara period. </p>
<p>Kadobe no Okimi (Ise no kuni no kami [Governor of Ise Province], Jugoinojo [Junior Fifth Rank, Upper Grade]) administered two provinces, namely Iga Provinc and Shima Province. </p>

<p>OTOMO no Sukunamaro (Bingo no kuni no kami [Governor of Bingo Province], Shogoinoge) administered two provinces, namely Aki Province, and Suo Province. </p>
<p>Since patrolling and maintaining the public order of the jurisdiction area were the main function of the Azechi, he sometimes received rebels' attack, developing an incident that KAMITSUKENO Hiroto, the Azechi of Mutsu Province, was murdered in the summer of 720. The Imperial court immediately appointed Tajihi agatamori, the Azechi of Musashi Province, as Jisetsu Sei Shogun (the general of conquering east-barbarians), SHIMOTSUKENU no Iwashiro as vice-shogun, and ABE no Suruga as Jisetsu Chinteki Shogun (the general of pacifying north barbarians) to suppress this incident. </p>
<p>Azechi (in the Meiji Period)<br/>
Azechi under the Meiji Government was a government officer to supervise local government. </p>
<p>It was established in 1869 when the governmental regulations were revised after the Ritsuryo system. As a government post, a director, undersecretary, sei-hangan (inspector), and associate judge were set up. Only Sanriku (i.e. Rikuzen Province, Rikuchu Province, Mutsu Province), Ryouu (i.e. Uzen Province, Ugo Province), Iwaki Province Azechi Office, and Echigo Azechi Office were established but did not in fact worked and in October 1870, the next year, they were abolished. </p>
