<h1><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kurodo (Chamberlain).html">Kurodo</a> no to (the name of a post) (蔵人頭)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kurodo (Chamberlain).html">Kurodo</a> no to, an official position outside of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ritsuryo.html">Ritsuryo</a> system (these positions were known as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Ryoge no kan (class outside of the Ritsuryo system).html">Ryoge no kan</a>), was effectively the head of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kurodo (Chamberlain).html">Kurodo</a> dokoro (chamberlain's office) (the nominal head, also known as the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kurodo (Chamberlain).html">Kurodo</a> betto, was also a minister). Handling Imperial papers and conveying statements to Emperor, "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kurodo (Chamberlain).html">Kurodo</a> no to" played a role that functioned something like a secretary to Emperor. Ordinarily, a person in Shii (the fourth rank) was appointed to "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kurodo (Chamberlain).html">Kurodo</a> no to" but was provided with no official court rank. Two people were appointed to the post of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kurodo (Chamberlain).html">Kurodo</a> no to. </p>
<p>As for the order of seats in the Imperial Court, the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kurodo (Chamberlain).html">Kurodo</a> no to occupied the top seats, higher even than the higher ranking tenjobito (high-ranking courtiers). For this reason, he was also called kanzu (a leader). In addition, use of kinjiki (literally, "forbidden colors," seven colors traditionally reserved for the imperial family and nobility) was permitted for him. </p>
<p>In 810 when Kurododokoro was established, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/FUJIWARA no Fuyutsugu.html">FUJIWARA no Fuyutsugu</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/KOSE no Notari.html">KOSE no Notari</a> were appointed to the first "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kurodo (Chamberlain).html">Kurodo</a> no to" posts. Corresponding to Fuyutsugu's success in his carrier, "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kurodo (Chamberlain).html">Kurodo</a> no to" came to be assigned to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Sangi.html">Sangi</a> (councilor) immediately when the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Sangi.html">sangi</a> post became available. Therefore, the post of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kurodo (Chamberlain).html">Kurodo</a> no to could be said to be a stepping stone to promotion to the court nobility. </p>
<p>Of the two "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kurodo (Chamberlain).html">Kurodo</a> no to" posts, one was assigned mostly to a person at the "Konoe no chujo" post, a post for military officers, and another to a person at the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Benkan (Collective name of posts in Daijokan).html">Benkan</a> post, a post for civil officers. Therefore, the term of "Tonochujo" was used to refer to the former personnel and "Tonoben" for the latter personnel. However, exceptions did occur during the Heian period. For example, when the Kura no kami (head of the Bureau of Palace Storehouses) jointly assumed the post of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kurodo (Chamberlain).html">Kurodo</a> no to, he was known as the toto (head-head). It was towards the end of the Heian period that the practice of assigning a "Tonochujo" and a "Tonoben" to "<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kurodo (Chamberlain).html">Kurodo</a> no to" was established. </p>
