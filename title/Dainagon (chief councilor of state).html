Its corresponding Chinese names are Asho (亜相) and Akai (亜槐). Both mean after (亜) the minister (相, 槐門). It is referred to as 'Ryusaku no kan' ('龍作の官', post created by a dragon), due to the note 'Dragon, create a nagon!' in Shokyo (one of the five classic texts of Confucianism). Corresponds to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shosanmi.html">Shosanmi</a> (Senior Third Rank). In the Edo period, the Tokugawa <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun family.html">Shogun family</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/family/Owari Tokugawa family.html">Owari Tokugawa family</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/family/Kishu Tokugawa family.html">Kishu Tokugawa family</a>, and Sunpu Tokugawa family (discontinued) of the Tokugawa clan were assigned. </p>
<p>The main function was to assist the tasks of the minister and to attend and execute court councils, and the number of regular personnel was originally four, but reduced to two in 705 when <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Chunagon.html">Chunagon</a> (vice-councilor of state) was reintroduced. However, during the Heian period, Gon Dainagon (temporary Dainagon with three regular personnel, which was later increased) was established, and the number of regular personnel practically increased. Later, eight personnel, at the most, were assigned, but since the reign of Emperor Gotoba, the number of regular personnel was fixed at six, and in many cases, Gon Dainagon was assigned without the official Dainagon. Under the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Dokyo.html">Dokyo</a> administration, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Hoshin.html">hoshin</a> that were similar in rank as Dainagon, were established, and monks were assigned. </p>
