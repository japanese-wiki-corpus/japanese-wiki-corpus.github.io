<h1>Shomotsu-bugyo (a governmental post of the Edo bakufu) (書物奉行)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Shomotsu-bugyo was a governmental post of the Edo bakufu. This post was established in 1633. The number of officers in the post was ordinarily four (but varied between three and five). The officer was under control of wakadoshiyori (a governmental post of the bakufu) officers, earned 200 straw bags of rice crop for his post and the amount of rice crop for seven persons as his yaku-buchi (a type of salary), and used the takibino-ma room (literally, a bonfire room). </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>Their jobs were the management of Momijiyama Library in the Edo castle, and the collection, classification, arrangement, storage and investigation of books. Famous shomotsu-bugyo officers included Konyo AOKI, Kageyasu TAKAHASHI, Juzo KONDO, and Hironao SHIBUKAWA. </p>
<p>Officers called doshin were placed under shomotsu-bugyo, in the salaries based on their social statuses, and the number of these officers was four in 1694 and was increased later to 21in the later Edo period.
