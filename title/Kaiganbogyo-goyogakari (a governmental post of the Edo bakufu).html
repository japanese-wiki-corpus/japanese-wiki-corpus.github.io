<h1>Kaiganbogyo-goyogakari (a governmental post of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Edo bakufu.html">Edo bakufu</a>) (海岸防禦御用掛)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kaiganbogyo-goyogakari was a governmental post of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Edo bakufu.html">Edo bakufu</a>. This post was commonly called "Kaibogakari" as well. </p>
<p>In June 1853, as suggested by the Netherlands, the East-Indian fleet led by Matthew (Calbraith) PERRY, who brought a personal letter from President Millard Fillmore of the United States of America, landed on Uraga and requested the opening of Japan to the world and a conclusion of a treaty through Ujiyoshi TODA, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Bugyo.html">Bugyo</a> (a governmental officer) in Shimoda. Corresponding to this situation, the post of Kaiganbogyo-goyogakari was established, centered on Masahiro ABE, the head of Roju (the second-highest post in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> government), to investigate how the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> should defense the nation on the sea. </p>
<p>When Perry's fleet arrived, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Ieyoshi TOKUGAWA.html">Ieyoshi TOKUGAWA</a>, the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> at that time, was dying, so it was impossible to expected of him to execute his political power at the national emergency. Abe abandoned the custom of the dictatorship by Fudai <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> (daimyo who had belonged to the Tokugawa group from before the Sekigawara war) and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Hatamoto (direct retainers of shogun).html">Hatamoto</a> (direct retainers of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>) centered on <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a>, recommended Nariaki TOKUGAWA, the lord of the Mito domain, to assume the coastal defense officer and made an inquiry about the matter to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> and Bakufu-yushi (officers of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>), and informed the Imperial court of the arrival of Perry's fleet. Furthermore, he restored Kaibogakari, and appointed the following persons to Kaiganbogyo-goyogakari. In addition, to investigate coastal defense measures to be taken by the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>, he had Chudayu TODA and Toko FUJITA, both confidants of Nariakira, participated in Kaiganbogyo-goyogakari as well and appointed Tatewaki AJIMA, also at the Mito domain and a younger brother of Chudayu TODA, to the secretary of Kaiganbogyo-goyogakari. </p>

<p>The members of Kaibogakari, including Nariaki TOKUGAWA, submitted coastal defense measures actively to the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>. However, in the next year, Masayoshi HOTTA, who had become the head of Roju replacing Abe, concluded the Japan-U.S. Treaty of Peace and Amity with the United States. Angered by the situation, Nariaki TOKUGAWA resigned from the coastal defense officer, ending the mission of Kaibogakari of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>. </p>
<p>It is said that the political method in which many <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> and many retainers of domains were allowed to participate in the governmental operations of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> gave a foothold for <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> and the Imperial court to get involved in the center of the politics, which led to the collapse of the shogun-based feudal system. </p>
