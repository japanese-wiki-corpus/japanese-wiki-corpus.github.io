<h1>Yoriki (a governmental post in the Edo bakufu) (与力)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Yoriki was a typical governmental post in the Edo bakufu. Yoriki (与力) was sometimes written as 寄騎, but the meaning of 与力 and that of 寄騎 depended on the era. </p>
<p>Before the Edo period,in order to organize sonae (back-up army), this term was also used for indicating a middle-class samurai, such as a head of ashigaru (foot soldiers) having themsleves under the control of an influential samurai. </p>
<p><h3>In the medieval period</h3>
</p>
<p>In the Kamakura period, both 与力 and 寄騎 were used simply refer to back-up soldiers, but later, these terms came to be more often used for indicating the lower-class samurai who followed daimyo or influential millitary commanders. </p>
<p>In the Sengoku period (period of warring states) (in Japan), these terms were often used for indicating "yori-ko" (寄子, where 子 indicates a child) (寄子 = local territory owners for influential military commanders (yori-oya: 寄親 where 親 indicates a parent)), not indicating lower-class samurai but local territoy owners. It was not rare that these territoty owners possessed land worth several thousand kanmon (kanmon: monetary unit at that time). </p>
<p>Furthermore, there were the yoriki-daimyo who were subordinated by a larger daimyo to reinforce his power. As a typical such example, Toshiie MAEDA was subordinated by Katsuie SHIBATA. </p>
<p>Daimyo in the Sengoku period racked their brains to prevent rebellion, considering that, when yori-ko (寄騎・寄子), territory owners were allowed to be integrated into yori-oya (寄親), the power of the yori-oya could become too big.. </p>
<p>Therefore, the daimyo in the Sengoku period, who led yori-oya, did not make these territory owners (yori-ko) retainers of their retainers but their direct retainers, and then made the yori-ko subordinated by their senior vassals or influential military commanders (yori-oya) to use the military power of the local territory owners effectively. In particular, these tactics were often seen in the Gohojo clan, the Imagawa clan, and the Uesugi clan. <h3>In the early-modern times</h3>
</p>
<p>In the Edo bakufu, yoriki were posted together with doshin (officers under yoriki) to assist their senior officers.. In particular, machi-kata yoriki under machi-bugyo (the post in charge of townspeople's affairs or officers in the post) was famous, assisted machi-bugyo, and played the functions of administration, judicature, and police. In addition to ordinary yoriki who belonged to Bugyo-sho, there were also uchiyori who were private retainers of machi-bugyo. It could be considered that a yoriki was the head of a police station. </p>
<p>Yoriki was allowed to ride on a horse, and top-class yoriki officers earned a two hundred and several tens of rice crop, surpassing lower-class Hatamoto (direct retainers of the bakufu). However, yoriki were not allowed to have audience with Shogun nor to enter the Edo castle. </p>
<p>For a yoriki officer, a residence with around 300 tubo (approximately 3.3 square meters/tubo) of premises was given. </p>
