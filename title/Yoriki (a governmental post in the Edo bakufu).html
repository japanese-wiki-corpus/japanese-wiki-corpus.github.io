<h1>Yoriki (a governmental post in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Edo bakufu.html">Edo bakufu</a>) (与力)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Yoriki was a typical governmental post in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Edo bakufu.html">Edo bakufu</a>. Yoriki (与力) was sometimes written as 寄騎, but the meaning of 与力 and that of 寄騎 depended on the era. </p>
<p>Before the Edo period,in order to organize <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Sonae.html">sonae</a> (back-up army), this term was also used for indicating a middle-class <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a>, such as a head of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ashigaru.html">ashigaru</a> (foot soldiers) having themsleves under the control of an influential <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a>. </p>
<p><h3>In the medieval period</h3>
</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period, both 与力 and 寄騎 were used simply refer to back-up soldiers, but later, these terms came to be more often used for indicating the lower-class <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> who followed <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> or influential millitary commanders. </p>
<p>In the Sengoku period (period of warring states) (in Japan), these terms were often used for indicating "yori-ko" (寄子, where 子 indicates a child) (寄子 = local territory owners for influential military commanders (yori-oya: 寄親 where 親 indicates a parent)), not indicating lower-class <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> but local territoy owners. It was not rare that these territoty owners possessed land worth several thousand <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/kanmon.html">kanmon</a> (kanmon: monetary unit at that time). </p>
<p>Furthermore, there were the yoriki-daimyo who were subordinated by a larger <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> to reinforce his power. As a typical such example, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Toshiie MAEDA.html">Toshiie MAEDA</a> was subordinated by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Katsuie SHIBATA.html">Katsuie SHIBATA</a>. </p>
<p><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">Daimyo</a> in the Sengoku period racked their brains to prevent rebellion, considering that, when yori-ko (寄騎・寄子), territory owners were allowed to be integrated into yori-oya (寄親), the power of the yori-oya could become too big.. </p>
<p>Therefore, the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> in the Sengoku period, who led yori-oya, did not make these territory owners (yori-ko) retainers of their retainers but their direct retainers, and then made the yori-ko subordinated by their senior vassals or influential military commanders (yori-oya) to use the military power of the local territory owners effectively. In particular, these tactics were often seen in the Gohojo clan, the Imagawa clan, and the Uesugi clan. <h3>In the early-modern times</h3>
</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Edo bakufu.html">Edo bakufu</a>, yoriki were posted together with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Doshin (patrol officer).html">doshin</a> (officers under yoriki) to assist their senior officers.. In particular, machi-kata yoriki under <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Machi-bugyo (town magistrate).html">machi-bugyo</a> (the post in charge of townspeople's affairs or officers in the post) was famous, assisted <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Machi-bugyo (town magistrate).html">machi-bugyo</a>, and played the functions of administration, judicature, and police. In addition to ordinary yoriki who belonged to Bugyo-sho, there were also uchiyori who were private retainers of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Machi-bugyo (town magistrate).html">machi-bugyo</a>. It could be considered that a yoriki was the head of a police station. </p>
<p>Yoriki was allowed to ride on a horse, and top-class yoriki officers earned a two hundred and several tens of rice crop, surpassing lower-class <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Hatamoto (direct retainers of shogun).html">Hatamoto</a> (direct retainers of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>). However, yoriki were not allowed to have audience with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> nor to enter the Edo castle. </p>
<p>For a yoriki officer, a residence with around 300 tubo (approximately 3.3 square meters/tubo) of premises was given. </p>
