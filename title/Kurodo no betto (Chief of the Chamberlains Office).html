<h1>Kurodo no betto (Chief of the Chamberlain's Office) (蔵人別当)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kurodo no betto was a post of Ryoge no kan (class outside of the Ritsuryo system) that was equivalent to a Kami (chief) of the Kurododokoro (Chamberlain's Office). Although Kurodo no betto was in an organizational position to supervise the entire staff at the Kurododokoro, including the Kurodo no to (Head Chamberlain), all of the general practical business at the Kurododokoro was the responsibility of the Kurodo no to and the Kurodo no betto was regarded only as a public representative and honorary position not involved in practical business. </p>
<p>The post was limited to one person at a time. 
<br/>As the role of a Kurodo no betto was to supervise the Tenjobito (a high-ranking courtier allowed into the Imperial Palace), it was also referred to as 'Tenjo no betto.'<br/>
The official duty of this post was to deliver Shochoku (Imperial edict) to each ministry. Although a Daijin (cabinet minister) and Second-rank personnel were generally appointed to Kurodo no betto as a second post, because it was Ryoge no kan the post did not have a corresponding official rank. </p>
<p>During the early Heian period in 897, the Kugyo (top court official) FUJIWARA no Tokihira was the first to be appointed to this post, but in later years it became a concurrent post for the Sadaijin (Minister of the Left). When the Sadaijin served as Kanpaku (chief adviser to the Emperor), however, the Udaijin (Minister of the Right) became the Kurodo no betto. </p>
<p>For example, after Seii Taishogun (literally "great general who subdues the barbarians") Yoshimitsu ASHIKAGA was appointed to Sadaijin on February 17, 1382, he concurrently held the post of Kurodo no betto on March 12, 1382. </p>
