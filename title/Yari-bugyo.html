<h1>Yari-bugyo (槍奉行)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Yari-bugyo was a post in the Edo shogunate. </p>
<p>Three to five persons were appointed the post under the roju (member of shogun's council of elders). The post took charge of administration of spears in the shogunate but was an easy job during times of peace. The post supervised the Nagara spear fighters unit and the Hachioji Sennin Doshin. </p>
