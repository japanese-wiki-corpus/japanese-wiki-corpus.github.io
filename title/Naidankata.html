<h1>Naidankata (内談方)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The Naidankata, that functioned from 1344 to 1349, was a Muromachi <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>) controlled deliberative organization managing the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shomusata (trial dealing with land-related issues).html">shomusata</a> (trial dealing with land-related issues). </p>
<p>At the beginning of the Muromachi <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>, Seii taishogun (great general) <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Takauji ASHIKAGA.html">Takauji ASHIKAGA</a> entrusted his real younger brother <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Tadayoshi ASHIKAGA.html">Tadayoshi ASHIKAGA</a> with a civil administration and a part of the military administration. Tadayoshi had managed the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shomusata (trial dealing with land-related issues).html">shomusata</a> by establishing the Hikitsukekata (adjudication office) based on an old system adopted by the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>, however the business became gradually complicated. Furthermore, he was annoyed by a feud with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/KO no Moronao.html">KO no Moronao</a>, a main retainer of the Ashikaga clan. </p>
<p>Therefore, Tadayoshi abolished the Hikitsukekata and instead established the Naidankata. Dividing the national land into three regions, the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> set up an office in each region, and appointed <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/KO no Moronao.html">KO no Moronao</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Tomosada UESUGI.html">Tomosada UESUGI</a> (the Futahashi Uesugi family) and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Shigeyoshi UESUGI.html">Shigeyoshi UESUGI</a> as the tonin (the director). They each managed the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shomusata (trial dealing with land-related issues).html">shomusata</a> with ten subordinate Yoryudo (officer of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>). In the original Hikitsukekata, the discussion and the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>'s ultimate decision-making (Tadayoshi made decision on behalf of shogun Takauji) on the settled items were thoroughly separated. Meanwhile, the newly established Naidankata was significant in some respects: Tadayoshi attended the discussion held at Naidankata and made an ultimate decision on the spot, Hikitsukekata had nearly a hundred members of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Naidanshu (judges).html">naidanshu</a> (judges) but the number was drastically reduced in the Naidankata to only thirty who were appointed by Yoryudo, moreover, attendance of Tadayoshi and his political rival <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/KO no Moronao.html">KO no Moronao</a>, a leader of opposition group, at the Naidankata gave no room to complain about the decision made by the Naidankata. Moreover, it is said that Tadayoshi tried to ensure his authority in decision making by gathering <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bushi.html">bushi</a> (group of warriors) supporting him to the Naidankata, aiming to keep Moronao in check. </p>
<p>Consequently, in spite of success in enhancing its political influence on the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shomusata (trial dealing with land-related issues).html">shomusata</a>, the Muromachi <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> could not achieve another goal of putting a period to the confrontation between Tadayoshi and Moronao, it rather deteriorated. Murder of captive <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Shigeyoshi UESUGI.html">Shigeyoshi UESUGI</a> by Moronao forced the Naidankata to stop functioning only five years after its establishment. It was not long before the Naidankata was effectively abolished because <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Gokenin.html">gokenin</a> (vassal of the shogunate) belonged to the Tadayoshi group, the main members of the Naidankata, left the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>. Afterwards, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshiakira ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshiakira ASHIKAGA</a> (later the second <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>), who took charge of the civil administration instead of Tadayoshi, restored the abolished Hikitsukekata without any reform, with the result that the discussion and the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>'s ultimate decision were separated again. </p>
