<h1>Kanrei-dai (representative of a shogunal deputy) (管領代)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>"Kanrei-dai" was a job title within the Muromachi bakufu (Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun). </p>
<p>Summary<br/>
Kanrei-dai was a temporary post rather than a permanent one, initially referring to a time when one of the three Kanrei families acted as the Kanrei (shogunal deputy). </p>
<p>After the Meio Coup when dominant figures in politics outside of the three Kanrei families held the real power of the shogunate, other personages assumed the post of Kanrei-dai. The most well known among Kanrei-dai were Yoshioki OUCHI, Nagayoshi MIYOSHI and Sadayori ROKKAKU. </p>
<p>In particular were OUCHI and MIYOSHI, who, despite their commission being temporary, were sometimes even called tenkabito (ruler of the country). According to Shinchoko-ki (The Biography of Nobunaga ODA), Nobunaga became jun-kanrei (deputy kanrei), but it is not clear whether or not the position was identical to the post of Kanrei-dai or even his assumption of the post. </p>
<p>As the head of the Hosokawa kanrei family, one held the title of deputy of ukeicho, and a position called Ukeicho-dai (deputy provisional master of right) even existed, but there is room for examination on whether or not the position should be included as a Kanrei-dai. </p>
