<h1>Kanrei-dai (representative of a shogunal deputy) (管領代)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>"Kanrei-dai" was a job title within the Muromachi <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>). </p>
<p>Summary<br/>
Kanrei-dai was a temporary post rather than a permanent one, initially referring to a time when one of the three <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kanrei.html">Kanrei</a> families acted as the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kanrei.html">Kanrei</a> (shogunal deputy). </p>
<p>After the Meio Coup when dominant figures in politics outside of the three <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kanrei.html">Kanrei</a> families held the real power of the shogunate, other personages assumed the post of Kanrei-dai. The most well known among Kanrei-dai were <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshioki OUCHI.html">Yoshioki OUCHI</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Nagayoshi MIYOSHI.html">Nagayoshi MIYOSHI</a> and Sadayori ROKKAKU. </p>
<p>In particular were OUCHI and MIYOSHI, who, despite their commission being temporary, were sometimes even called tenkabito (ruler of the country). According to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Shinchoko-ki (A Biography of Lord Nobunaga).html">Shinchoko-ki</a> (The Biography of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Nobunaga ODA.html">Nobunaga ODA</a>), Nobunaga became jun-kanrei (deputy <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kanrei.html">kanrei</a>), but it is not clear whether or not the position was identical to the post of Kanrei-dai or even his assumption of the post. </p>
<p>As the head of the Hosokawa <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kanrei.html">kanrei</a> family, one held the title of deputy of ukeicho, and a position called Ukeicho-dai (deputy provisional master of right) even existed, but there is room for examination on whether or not the position should be included as a Kanrei-dai. </p>
