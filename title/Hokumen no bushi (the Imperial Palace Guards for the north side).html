<p></p>
<p>"Hokumen no <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bushi.html">bushi</a>" were <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> who served the retired emperor, standing by as the gero (servant) on the north side of the in (imperial palace of the retired emperor), and guarding or accompanying the retired emperor when he made trips outside.. </p>
<p><h3>Establishment of the hokumen and the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Insei.html">insei</a> (rule by the retired Emperor) period</h3>
</p>
<p>Hokumen was established soon after Emperor <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Shirakawa (the surroundings of the old capital, Kyoto).html">Shirakawa</a> began <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Insei.html">insei</a> at the end of the eleventh century. The north side of the imperial palace of the retired emperor was designated as the guardroom, and hokumen referred to the public servants such as courtier and guardians who stood by to guard and accompany the retired emperor during his outings. In the "<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Buddhism/Gukansho.html">Gukansho</a>" (Jottings of a Fool), it is described as follows. </p>
<p>During Emperor <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Shirakawa (the surroundings of the old capital, Kyoto).html">Shirakawa</a>'s reign, there was an upper and lower hokumen inside the imperial palace. The upper hokumen housed some <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shodaibu (aristocracy lower than Kugyo).html">shodaibu</a> (public servants of the fourth and fifth rank) while the lower hokumen housed many efushoshijo (guardian servant, inspectors). Members of the lower hokumen would, followed by other servants, accompany the emperor on imperial outings armed with arrows.'<br/>
</p>
<p>As was described here, there were the upper hokumen and lower hokumen, and the upper (shau) were stationed in the two rooms in the court, and there were tenjobito (persons who were allowed to enter the Emperor's residence). They were mainly courtiers from the fourth or fifth rank <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shodaibu (aristocracy lower than Kugyo).html">shodaibu</a> class. However, it was a station for those allowed to enter the in but had a different role, and being fifth rank or higher did not necessarily mean they were stationed here. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">Samurai</a> were not in the court, but were in the 'lower side' (ka or ke), which was a building with five gaps between pillars along the mud wall with a roof north of the imperial palace, and this was not just for <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a>, but also for gochodo (sodomy partner) of Shirakawain and gojiso (a priest who prays to guard the emperor). 
<br/>It was also referred to as 'gero.'<br/>
Later, it was also effective when petitioned by temples and shrines, and priest soldiers. Unlike mushadokoro (place where <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">Samurai</a> of guard of the Imperial Palace is staffed) or takiguchi, hokumen no <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bushi.html">bushi</a> were each a class of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> or high-level officers with certain number of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a>, and the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> force they led when they suppressed the masses at <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/shrines/Enryaku-ji Temple.html">Enryaku-ji Temple</a> in 1118, is said to have numbered one thousand. </p>
<p>However, hokumen included many <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kebiishi (police and judicial chief).html">kebiishi</a> (a police and judicial chief), and Shirakawain gave direct orders to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kebiishi (police and judicial chief).html">kebiishi</a> instead of through betto (superintendent), the original chain of command of the Kebiishicho (Office of Police and Judicial Chief), which led to the hollowing out of Kebiishicho, a characteristic of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Insei.html">insei</a> period. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/TAIRA no Masamori.html">TAIRA no Masamori</a> and his child, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/TAIRA no Tadamori.html">TAIRA no Tadamori</a>, became the head of hokumen no <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bushi.html">bushi</a>, and used it as leverage to advance their positions in the office of the retired emperor. <h3>People who served as hokumen no <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bushi.html">bushi</a></h3>

Later, its scale gradually shrank until it became merely a troop of guards for the imperial palace, and even their function as guards was lost as times changed from the Muromachi period, period of Oda and Toyotomi, and to the Edo period, but despite the fact that it did not appear at all in the Kinmon Incident when fire by war came closest to the imperial palace in modern history, it existed until the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Meiji Restoration (Meiji-ishin).html">Meiji Restoration</a> to describe family lineage. </p>
