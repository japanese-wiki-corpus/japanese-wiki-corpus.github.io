<h1>Shorokui (正六位)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Shorokui (Senior Sixth Rank) is one of the ranks in Ikai (court ranks) and Shinkai (ranks granted to Shinto gods). This rank is lower than Jugoi (Junior Fifth Rank) and higher than Jurokui (Junior Sixth Rank). This rank is the equivalent of the Fifth Order of Merit in Kunto (the Order of Merit) as well as the Fifth Order in Kinshi kunsho (the Order of the Golden Kite). </p>
<p>Under the ritsuryo system, Rokui (Sixth Rank) was conferred on Kokushi (provincial governors) of Gekoku (minor provinces) as well as on Suke (assistant provincial governor) being Suke (assistant director) of Kokufu (provincial office). Rokui was the Ikai for Jigenin (a lower rank of ancient Japanese nobility), which was demarcated from the nobles (Tsuki [intermediate ranking nobles]) with Goi (Fifth Rank) or higher, and was not allowed to enter the Imperial Palace. However, Kurodo (Chamberlain) was, due to their duties, allowed to enter the Imperial Palace even when their Ikai was Rokui, and thus people with Goi or higher and Rokui no kurodo (kurodo with the Sixth Rank) were called Tenjobito (a high-ranking courtier allowed into the Imperial Palace). Shorokui (Senior Sixth Rank) is the lowest rank in Shinkai (ranks granted to Shinto gods). </p>
<p>After the Meiji period, people with the military rank of lieutenant commander and the like were conferred this rank upon. Nowadays, this rank is conferred on a senior superintendent among police officers as well as a fire warden among the officers with rank in the Fire Fighting Head Offices of local governments, and the rank is also conferred posthumously on a chairman of the local assembly, founder of special facilities or schools as well as people who made achievements in business. </p>
