<h1>Shokei (court novels who work at the Imperial Court in high ranking posts) (上卿)</h1>
<p>The Shokei, mainly in the Heian period, referred to a person of the highest rank in an organization or a function that nobles were involved in, but the Shokei commonly served in the following two posts:<br/>
</p>
<p>The Shokei was the head equivalent to the chairperson of 'Jin no sadame' (Jingi - the ancient cabinet council), which was a de facto supreme council under the Dajokan (Great Council of State) System--the administrative body of the Ritsuryo system (a system of centralized government based on the ritsuryo code). The Sadaijin (minister of the left) or, if absent, the Udaijin (minister of the right) assumed the head of the 'Jin' (the council), because the Sessho (regent) and the Kanpaku (chief adviser to the Emperor) served as assistant and deputy of the Emperor and did not participate in the Jin and Daijo-daijin (Grand minister of state) that was an honorary post. </p>
<p>When the Shokei is referred to in connection with important events for the Imperial Court such as Daijosai (first ceremonial offering of rice by newly-enthroned Emperor) and Kamo Festival, he worked as the director and ran such events. The Jimoku (ceremony for appointing officials) assigned.nobles of higher ranks as an assistant of the head depending on how important the event was. </p>
