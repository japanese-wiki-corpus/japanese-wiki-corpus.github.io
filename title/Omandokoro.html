<p>Omandokoro<br/>
In the Japanese aristocracy society, omandokoro is a title given to a mother based on an emperor's direction when her child was serving as the Sessho (the title of a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Regent.html">regent</a> given to who is named to assist an emperor when the emperor is still a child, or before coming of age, or when a female), or the Kanpaku - the title of a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Regent.html">regent</a> who assists an adult emperor. 
<br/>It is an abbreviation of okitanomandokoro<br/>
</p>
<p>Usually, omandokoro refers to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI.html">Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI</a>'s mother, Naka. More detailed information will be provided in this section. </p>
<p>Naka<br/>
</p>
<p>Omandokoro was a woman who lived from the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Sengoku Period (period of warring states) (Japan).html">Sengoku Period</a> (Period of Warring States - Japan) through the Azuchi-Momoyama Period (1513 - August 29, 1592). Her formal name was Naka, and she gave birth to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI.html">Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI</a>, Hidenaga TOYOTOMI, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Nisshu.html">Nisshu</a> and Asahihime. </p>
<p>Career<br/>
Omandokoro is the abbreviation of the original term 'okitamandokoro,' and a honorific title given to a mother with a child serving as the sessho or kanpaku, and in a modern era, it is common to refer her (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Juichii.html">Juichii</a> - Junior First Rank). </p>
<p>In 1513, she was born as the daughter of Kanesada SEKI who was running a forging shop and also in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> class in Gokiso-mura, Aichi-gun, Owari Province (Aichi Prefecture). The Seki clan was a family who was engaged in the business of forging swords. It is also thought she was born 1516. </p>
<p>She got married with Yaemon KINOSHITA (Shokichi KINOSHITA and Yasuke NAKAMURA) who was serving as the head of conscripted foot-soldiers for <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Nobuhide ODA.html">Nobuhide ODA</a> and she gave birth to Nisshu-in and Hideyoshi. Meanwhile, after her husband died in the war (actually, died of a disease), she got married with Masamori MIZUNO (Chikuami) who was serving as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Doboshu.html">doboshu</a> (government post) for Hidenobu. 
<br/>She gave birth to Hidenaga and Asahihime during that period of time (Father of Hidenaga and Asahihime is believed to be Yaemon or Chikuami.)<br/>
</p>
<p>Later years of Omandokoro<br/>
Upon the promotion of Hideyoshi to the Kanpaku in 1585, she was called Omandokoro. In 1586, Hideyoshi advised <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Ieyasu TOKUGAWA.html">Ieyasu TOKUGAWA</a> to carry out the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Joraku.html">joraku</a> (going to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> to seize power), but it was unsuccessful, and he sent Asahihime for his legal wife and Omandokoro as a hostage to Okazaki, Mikawa Province. As a result, Ieyasu agreed to the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/culture/Joraku.html">joraku</a>, and Omandokoro was able to return to Osaka in a month or so. </p>
<p>Hideyoshi called for his mother to live and stay in the castle when he became the owner of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Nagahama-jo Castle (Omi Prefecture).html">Nagahama-jo Castle</a>, and it is well known that he always cared about his mother throughout the rest of her life. Omandokoro got along with Kodai-in very well, who was Hideyoshi's bride. According to various tales, she was a wise and smart woman. </p>
<p>After the preceding death of her children, Asahihime and Hidenaga, she died in 1592 at <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Jurakudai.html">Jurakudai</a> (Hideyoshi's residence in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>.)<br/>
She was eighty (or, seventy seven) year old. </p>
