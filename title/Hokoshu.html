<h1>Hokoshu (奉公衆)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Hokoshu was a govermental position established by the Muromachi <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>). It is military power belonging directly to the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>, and was called ban-shu or ban-kata because it was organized as goke-ban (literally, five ban). It was also called <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Banshu.html">banshu</a> (kobanshu). </p>
<p>Inheriting the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Banshu.html">banshu</a> system in the palace in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period, Hokoshu were the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Gokenin.html">gokenin</a> who were differenciated from general <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Gokenin.html">gokenin</a> (an immediate vassal of the shogunate in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> and Muromachi through Edo periods) or jito (manager and lord of manor) and closely waited on thier <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Otomoshu.html">otomoshu</a>, literally, the attendant group). 
<br/>If <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Bugyoshu (group of magistrates).html">bugyoshu</a> (group of magistrates) were civilian officials during the Muromachi <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> government,<br/>
</p>
<p>Hokoshu could be called military officials. </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>According to the remaining "Gobancho (literally, descriptions of ban, squad)" where the organization of Hokoshu in the eighth <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshimasa ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshimasa ASHIKAGA</a> era was described, Hokoshu consisted of five squads, with each squad including 50 to 100 persons and 300 to 400 persons in total, and when wakato (young <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a>) and chu-gen (lower-class retainers) were also counted, it is considered that Hokoshu had the military power of 5,000 to 10,000 persons. It is said that Hokoshu was also organized under <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> kubo (shogunal representative) and under Furukawa kubo. </p>
<p>Its members consisted of dominent <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Gokenin.html">gokenin</a>, members of the Ashikaga clan, powerful <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shugo daimyo.html">Shugo daimyo</a> (Japanese territorial lord as provincial constable) and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kokujin.html">Kokujin</a> (local <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a>). With the membeship of a squad inherited, it is said that the bond among the members was strong, and they acted jointly in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Onin War.html">Onin War</a>. The number of Hokoshu of the Mikawa Province, located at an important location for the Ashikaga clan, was more than 40, the largest of all of the provinces. </p>
<p>During peacetime, Hokoshu commuted, for example, to Bannai (the squad room) placed within the palace, and functioned as military power in emergencioes. Hokoshu was entrusted to the management of local <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Goryosho.html">goryosho</a> (shogunate's estate) and was also given the rights to prevent <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a> (provincial constable) from entering their own lands and to collect <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Tansen.html">tansen</a> (a kind of provisional tax in medieval Japan). <h3>History</h3>
</p>
<p>During the early Muromachi period, political fights occurred frequently among powerful <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a> even within the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> government, in addition to activities of various powers including that of the Southern Dynasty (in Japan), and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoriyuki HOSOKAWA.html">Yoriyuki HOSOKAWA</a>, deputy to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>, lost his position in Coup of Koryaku in 1379. Therefore, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshimitsu ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshimitsu ASHIKAGA</a>, the third <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>, formed a goup of bodyguards called Oumamawari to confront <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a>'s power. They played an active role as military power belonged directly to the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> in Meitoku War, caused by the Yamana clan, and in the Oei War, caused by the Ouchi clan in 1391. </p>
<p>However, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshimochi ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshimochi ASHIKAGA</a>, the fouth <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>, still depended on the military power of the Hatakeyama clan, and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshinori ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshinori ASHIKAGA</a>, the sixth <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>, aimed at strengthening his power following the policies used by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshimitsu ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshimitsu ASHIKAGA</a>. 
<br/><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshihisa ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshihisa ASHIKAGA</a>, the ninth <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>, established Hokoshu as well as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Bugyoshu (group of magistrates).html">Bugyoshu</a> who were civil officers as an official system, and Hokoshu played an active role as bodyguards for <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> in the battle for subjugating Rokkaku clan in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Omi Province.html">Omi Province</a> in 1487<br/>
</p>
<p><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshitane ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshitane ASHIKAGA</a>, the tenth <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>, subjugated the Rokkaku clan in 1491 by leading Hokoshu, went on a journey for subjugating Yoshitoyo HATAKEYAMA in the Kawach Province in 1493, but while he was on the journey, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Masamoto HOSOKAWA.html">Masamoto HOSOKAWA</a>, deputy to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>, abolished the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> position (Coup of Meio), effectively dismantling the Hokoshu system. </p>
