<h1>Shonii (正二位)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Shonii (Senior Second Rank) is one of the ranks in Ikai (court ranks) and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinkai.html">Shinkai</a> (ranks granted to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> gods) in Japan. This rank is lower than <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Juichii.html">Juichii</a> (Junior First Rank) and upper than <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Junii (Junior Second Rank).html">Junii</a> (Junior Second Rank). </p>
<p>This rank is the equivalent of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Sadaijin (Minister of the Left).html">Sadaijin</a> (minister of the left) and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Udaijin (Minister of the Right).html">Udaijin</a> (minister of the right) in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ritsuryo.html">ritsuryo</a> system (a system of centralized government based on the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ritsuryo.html">ritsuryo</a> code). Seii taishogun (literally, "great general who subdues the barbarians") in Muromachi <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Edo bakufu.html">Edo bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal governments headed by a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>) often stayed in this rank during their tenure as Seii taishogun. Also, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kugyo.html">Kugyo</a> (the top court officials) who did not rise to a minister and who were lower in rank than the Urin family (the fourth highest family status for court nobles), including <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Dainagon (chief councilor of state).html">Dainagon</a> (chief councilor of state) and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Chunagon.html">Chunagon</a> (vice-councilor of state), were promoted to this rank. In the Order of Merit, this rank was the equivalent of the Supreme Order or the First Order of Merit. </p>
<p>In the case of people who were conferred Shonii upon as a posthumous rank from the Heian period to the end of Edo period, their Ikai (Court rank) was written as "Shonii, posthumously conferred." </p>
<p>From the Meji Period to the end of the Second World War, this rank was conferred on such people as an official appointed by the emperor, an imperial appointee as well as the peerage. </p>
<p>Since Ikai as an honor stipulated in the Constitution of Japan is conferred posthumously, it is usually conferred on Sanken-no-cho (chiefs of three organization of powers), who rendered distinguished services such as a prime minister, after their death. </p>
