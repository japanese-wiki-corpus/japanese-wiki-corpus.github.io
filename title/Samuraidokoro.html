<h1>Samuraidokoro (侍所)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Samuraidokoro was the organization that played military and police roles in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>) and in the Muromachi <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>. </p>
<p>In the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a><br/>
It called up and commanded the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Gokenin.html">gokenin</a> who were to do event-guarding or some other jobs, and locked up criminals. </p>
<p>Dominant <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Gokenin.html">gokenin</a> who assumed the post of shoshi (Deputy Chief of the Board of Retainers) or Samurai-dokoro no <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Tsukasa (a rank in government offices).html">tsukasa</a> (the officer of the Board of Retainers) controlled Samuraidokoro, and the person in the highest rank among shoshi was called betto (chief officer). Initially, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshimori WADA.html">Yoshimori WADA</a> assumed the post of betto, but after Yoshimori died in the Wada battle, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shikken (regent for the shogun).html">shikken</a> (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Regent.html">regent</a> to the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>) assumed the post as well. </p>
<p>In the Muromachi <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a><br/>
Following the organization of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>, it was established in 1336 together with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Mandokoro.html">Mandokoro</a> (Administrative Board) and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Monchujo.html">Monchujo</a> (a court of justice). In the early Muromachi period, the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> was controlled by both of Shogun Takauji and Tadayoshi, his younger brother, but since the head of Samuraidokoro was <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/KO no Moroyasu.html">KO no Moroyasu</a>, the elder brother of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/KO no Moronao.html">KO no Moronao</a> who was the steward of the Ashikaga family, it is considered that Samuraidokoro was an organization controlled directly by the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>. </p>
<p>As in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>, the major job of Samuraidokoro was to control <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Gokenin.html">gokenin</a> and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a>, with the jos related to kendan (trial) and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shomusata (trial dealing with land-related issues).html">shomusata</a> (trials dealing with land issues) done by Kendangata (office of criminal justice), but the latter jos were gradually transferred to Samuraidokoro as well. 
<br/>In the era of the second shogun Yoshiakira, the job of Kebiishicho (the office dealing with police and judicial matters) was transferred to Samuraidokoro, and Samuraidokoro became to gain police power for maintaining security of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> as well as the power to levy taxes<br/>
In the era of the third shogun Yoshimitsu, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a> (provincial constable) was placed in the Yamashiro Province, and Samuraidokoro became an organization to control <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> as the area directly controlled by Muromachi-dono (Muromachi <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>). From 1398, the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/family/Akamatsu clan.html">Akamatsu clan</a>, Isshiki clan, Kyogoku clan and Yamana clan assumed the post of shoshi alternatively, and a vassal of shoshi assumed the post of shoshi-dai (assistant to shoshi), with these four clans called <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shishiki.html">Shishiki</a> (Four major feudal lords who worked for Muromachi <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>). </p>
<p>The person in the post called shoshi or tonin (the director) controlled Samuraidokoro, and shoshi-dai assisted shoshi. Actual operations were conducted by bugyonin (magistrate), and kodoneri and zoshiki, lower-ranked officers, were also organized. In addition, kaiko (the head of clerical officers) was placed for clerical officers, and there were also <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Metsuke (a governmental post of the Edo bakufu).html">metsuke</a> who played watching roles and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yoriudo.html">yoriudo</a> who were equivalent to interrogators. </p>
<p>Chronological table<br/>
</p>
<p>In addition, descriptions of a banquet that was held and baggage that was stored, were included in Azumakagami (The Mirror of the East), a historical book in Japan. </p>
