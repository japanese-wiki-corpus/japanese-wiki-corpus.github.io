<h1>Daisanji (second to a governor) (大参事)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Daisanji was a government post next to a chief of chihokan (local officials) placed during the time of fu-han-ken sanchisei (fu-han-ken tripartite governance system) in the early Meiji period. It is equivalent to current vice-prefectural governor and Karo (chief retainer) in the feudal system characteristic of the shogunate. </p>
<p>In 1869, it was decided that Sei Daisanji (formal Daisanji) and Gon Daisanji (temporary Daisanji) were placed under prefectural governors (Chifuji [prefectural governor], Chihanji [domain governor], Chikenji [prefectural governor]) by the reform of the governmental regulations after the return of lands and people to the emperor (There was no gonkan [supernumerary position] in prefectures). </p>
<p>Sei and Gon Daisanji in domains must concurrently have been members of Kogisho (the lower house) but after the Kogisho abolished, either of them became a councilor of Shugiin (whose name was changed from Kogisho). </p>
<p>In 1871, councilors were placed in prefectures and the government post of Daisanji was abolished due to the establishment of governmental regulation of prefectures accompanying Haihan-chiken (abolition of feudal domains and establishment of prefectures). </p>
