<p>Bugyoshu, also called Yuhitsukata, were of group of Bugyonin (magistrates) who were lawyers of the bureaucracy within the Muromachi <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>). As a group of civil officers with direct control of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>, they were correspondents to the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Hokoshu.html">Hokoshu</a> (guard force with direct control of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>), a group of military officers. </p>

</div>

<p><h3>The early stage of the Muromachi <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a></h3>
</p>
<p>Bugyonin had already existed within the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>, and upon its collapse, a number of them followed <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Takauji ASHIKAGA.html">Takauji ASHIKAGA</a> and joined the Muromachi <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> to be employed as Bugyonin. At first, Bugyonin were referred to as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Yuhitsu.html">Yuhitsu</a> (private secretary), were assigned to the judicial institution called Hikitsuke and were put in charge of drafting hosho (documents informing lower-ranked people of decisions made by those in the upper ranks) and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Migyosho.html">migyosho</a> (documents to inform people of decisions made by those in the Third Rank or above). In addition, Bugyonin were also assigned to various judicial institutions established in the Muromachi <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>, such as the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Jinseigata.html">jinseigata</a> (authority of a relief system for judicial decision of the litigation by hikitsukeshu, coadjutor of the high court), teichugata (authority of a relief system for mistakes of the litigation in the Middle Ages, later becoming direct appeal to the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>) and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Naisogata.html">Naisogata</a> (one of the legal institutions set up in the early stage of Muromachi <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>). </p>
<p>However, after the downfall of Naoyoshi ASHIKAGA, who played the leading role in planning for a new administration that carried over from the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> system, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshimitsu ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshimitsu ASHIKAGA</a> consecutively became the In no betto (chief administrator of the Retired Emperor's office) and Daijodaijin (Grand Minister) absorbing the political functions of the retired emperor's office and Imperial Court into the structure of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>. As a consequence of these developments, the duties of Bugyonin began changing as well. </p>
<p>Hikitsuke were effectively made obsolete and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Yuhitsu.html">Yuhitsu</a> (amanuensis, secretary) were stationed at places such as the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Mandokoro.html">Mandokoro</a> (Administrative Board), the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Samuraidokoro.html">Samuraidokoro</a> (Board of Retainers), <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Monchujo.html">Monchujo</a> (Board of Inquiry) and Onshokata (department that handled reward duties). </p>
<p>A number of Bugyonin were appointed to a post in charge of special assignments and were referred to as 'Betsu-bugyo' (extra <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Bugyo.html">bugyo</a>). </p>
<p>Influential figures among the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Yuhitsu.html">Yuhitsu</a> were called Gozenbugyonin (also <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Gozenshu.html">Gozenshu</a>, Gozensatashu and Onshokatashu) and were allowed to participate in Gozensata (Shogunal hearings) that were presided over by the seii taishogun (literally, "great general who subdues the barbarians"). Gozensata, primarily set up at the Onshokata, had the characteristics of being the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a>'s private meetings when compared to conferences consisting of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Hyojoshu (government post).html">Hyojoshu</a> (members of the Council of State) and Hikitsukeshu (also called <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Naidanshu (judges).html">Naidanshu</a>) (a line-up of officials who practiced trial and litigation for the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>). Within Gozensata meetings, Bugyonin initially held the position of preparing drafts for judicial decisions called ikenjo (reports submitted by underlings to answer the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a>'s inquiries), but Gozenbugyonin were later personally authorized by the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> to participate in Gozensata and state their opinions directly. <h3>The Yoshinori Era</h3>
</p>
<p>As it became the era of Yoshinari ASHIKAGA, the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> began making important decisions at Gozensata meetings in order to control officers of lesser or equal rank to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kanrei.html">Kanrei</a> (Shogunal deputy); Gozenbugyonin, who were well versed in legislation, precedents and Yusoku kojitsu (court and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> rules of ceremony and etiquette), formally handled drafting and putting the seal on the hosho (papers) (Bugyonin hosho) that had the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a>'s mandates. Under such circumstances, their opinions at Gozensata meetings began to have a serious influence on the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a>'s decisions and they gradually established themselves as private consultants of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a>. </p>
<p>Of particular note was the highest-ranking Gozenbugyonin, referred to as Kuninbugyo, who together with having control of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Yuhitsu.html">Yuhitsu</a> and Bugyonin became a member of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Hyojoshu (government post).html">Hyojoshu</a>. Following suit were several high-ranking Gozenbugyo who also received treatment equal to that of the Hikitsukeshu (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Naidanshu (judges).html">Naidanshu</a>). In this period, the Saito, Matsuda, Iio and Fuse clans made it a family tradition to pass on the knowledge learned from the descendents of the Ota and Miyoshi clans, who were the Bugyonin of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period, generation after generation through a limited ancestry and came to dominate the positions of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Yuhitsu.html">Yuhitsu</a> and Bugyonin in addition to forming the groups of Bugyoshu and Yuhitsukata. In spite of the importance of their role, they could only be promoted up to Kaigo (Deputy Chief of the office) or Shitsujidai (deputy steward), which were equivalent to an assistant director of an organization within the formal structure of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>. In addition, Bugyonin (Gozensatashu), who were no higher than Gozenbugyonin, were collectively called Gozenmisanshu. </p>
<p>Furthermore, there were a number of individuals within these families who were unable to assume an official <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> post, but there were also a few who were employed by influential <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> (provincial military governors becoming <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> (Japanese feudal lords)) and demonstrated their abilities within the fields of justice and document preparation. It is believed that one of these individuals was Tsunehisa IIO (Hikoroku <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Saemon no jo (Government Post).html">Saemon no jo</a>), who served the Hosokawa clan <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a> (governor) of Awa Province and composed a poem depicting <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> in burnt ruins after the Onin war. <h3>For further interest</h3>
</p>
<p>Even after the Yoshinori Era, the Bugyoshu increased its influence within the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>, and while <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshimasa ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshimasa ASHIKAGA</a> was the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>, for all practical purposes the Bugyoshu constituted the virtually supreme advisory board of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> in place of existing official posts such as the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Hyojoshu (government post).html">Hyojoshu</a>. Under these circumstances, a clash occurred between the Bugyoshu and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Hokoshu.html">Hokoshu</a> in 1485. </p>
<p>While the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Hokoshu.html">Hokoshu</a> as a group of military officers were dissolved by the Coup of Meio due to the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kanrei.html">Kanrei</a> aiming to take over the authority of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>, the value of the Bugyoshu, who were in charge of preparing documents and judicial matters, continued to exist as long as the structure of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> existed. Entering the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Sengoku Period (period of warring states) (Japan).html">Sengoku Period</a> (Period of Warring States) (Japan) when <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshitane ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshitane ASHIKAGA</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshizumi ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshizumi ASHIKAGA</a> both stood as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>, the Bugyoshu divided as well and mutually existed in both <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> structures. The <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> seldom attended Gozensata during this period and the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Naidanshu (judges).html">Naidanshu</a> (Assistants for Council) (denchu <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Moshitsugi.html">moshitsugi</a> (transmitter or transmitting of messages of the palaces), <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Naidankata.html">Naidankata</a>), reorganized by close associates to the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>, transmitted decisions made by the Bugyoshu to the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> and obtained approval. It believed that it was in this manner that the Bugyoshu continued to exist as an entity that supported the administrative structure of the Muromachi <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> until its collapse. </p>
