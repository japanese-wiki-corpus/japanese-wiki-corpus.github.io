<p></p>
<p>"Jusanmi" (Junior Third Rank) is a rank in court ranks and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Shinkai.html">shinkai</a> (ranks granted to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> gods). </p>
<p>It ranked below <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shosanmi.html">Shosanmi</a> (Senior Third Rank) and above <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shoshii (Senior Fourth Rank).html">Shoshii</a> (Senior Fourth Rank) (Shoshiinojo (Senior Fourth Rank, Upper Grade)). Under the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Ritsuryo.html">Ritsuryo</a> system (a system of centralized government based on the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Ritsuryo.html">ritsuryo</a> code), those ranked Ninsangi and Jusanmi or higher were called <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kugyo.html">kugyo</a> (court noble). In case of posthumous honor, it was called Zojusanmi (posthumous Jusanmi). </p>
<p>Jusanmi<br/>
Under the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Ritsuryo.html">ritsuryo</a> system, Jusanmi or higher ranks were called "ki" (literally, noble) or star ranks, and were court ranks for senior <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kizoku (nobles).html">kizoku</a> (noble). When contrasted with kunto (Order of Merit), it corresponds to Kunnito (Order of Second Class), and those with Shoshiinojo <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Sangi.html">Sangi</a> (councilor) and Jusanmi or higher court ranks were considered <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kugyo.html">kugyo</a> or kandachime (court noble). </p>
<p>Under the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Ritsuryo.html">ritsuryo</a> system, those with ranks Shoshiinojo <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Sangi.html">Sangi</a>, Jusanmi, or higher added 'Ason' (second highest of the eight hereditary titles) under their family names and a title of honor, 'kyo,' was added under their first names (imina (real name)), while those who served as a minister were given a title of honor, 'ko.'<br/>
Instead, those who were <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Jushii.html">Jushii</a> (Junior Fourth Rank) or higher, but not a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kugyo.html">kugyo</a>, added 'Ason' under their family names and imina. Additionally, when a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kugyo.html">kugyo</a> ranking Sanmi or higher died, the term <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/building/Kokyo.html">kokyo</a> was used, as was the case with the imperial family, to describe their death. 
<br/>Furthermore, in later years, they were referred to as 'Sanmi-dono' or 'Sanmi-sama.'<br/>
</p>
<p>In addition, those ranking Sanmi or higher were allowed to establish a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Mandokoro.html">mandokoro</a> (administrative division of a high-rank family) as an agency for the household, and had Shikiji Jusanmi Karei (butler), Shoshoinoge Shikiji Sanmi Keshori as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Keishi (household superintendent).html">keishi</a> (personnel in charge of household affairs). </p>
<p>In kani soto (corresponding relationship between court ranks of government officials and government posts), the corresponding government officials for Jusanmi are <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Dazai no sochi (also known as Dazai no sotsu) (Head of Dazaifu).html">Dazai no sochi</a> (Governor-General of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Dazai-fu (local government office in Kyushu region).html">Dazai-fu</a> offices, danjoin (President of the Board of Censors), <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Chunagon.html">Chunagon</a> (Vice-councilor of state), left and right Konoe-Daisho (commander of the inner palace guard division), etc., but in reality, the Imperial Prince often served as the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Dazai no sochi (also known as Dazai no sotsu) (Head of Dazaifu).html">Dazai no sochi</a>, Konoe-Daisho was routinely doubled by the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Sadaijin (Minister of the Left).html">Sadaijin</a> (minister of the left) and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Udaijin (Minister of the Right).html">Udaijin</a> (minister of the right), and those with Sanmi often became left or right Konoe-Chujo (lieutenant general of the inner palace guard division). Therefore, those who serve as Chujo despite being Sanmi were called Sanmi-Chujo (Third Rank assistant director). </p>
<p>In the Heian period, until <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/TAIRA no Kiyomori.html">TAIRA no Kiyomori</a> became the first <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> to become <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kugyo.html">kugyo</a>, the highest rank for both <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Seiwa-Genji (Minamoto clan).html">Seiwa-Genji</a> (Minamoto clan) and Kanmu-Heishi (Taira clan) was <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shoshii (Senior Fourth Rank).html">Shoshii</a>. Thus, when <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Yorimasa.html">MINAMOTO no Yorimasa</a> of Settsu-Genji (Minamoto clan), who had become a tributary of the Minamoto clan at that time, became the first from the Minamoto clan to be promoted to Jusanmi, after the Taira family were granted Sanmi and higher ranks, it was considered exceptional and was referred to as Genzanmi. </p>
<p>From the Muromachi period onward, the rank of Jusanmi was granted to successive generations of members of the Ashikaga Shogunate and the Kamakura Shogunate, as well as to Yoshishige SHIBA and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshitoshi SHIBA.html">Yoshitoshi SHIBA</a> of the Shiba clan, members of whom held the position of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kanrei.html">kanrei</a> (deputy to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>). Additionally, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Mochikuni HATAKEYAMA.html">Mochikuni HATAKEYAMA</a> who supported the shogunate as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kanrei.html">kanrei</a> was also promoted to Jusanmi, and there are cases of the rank being granted to powerful members of the Ashikaga family. Furthermore, in the late Muromachi period, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Masanori AKAMATSU.html">Masanori AKAMATSU</a>, a powerful <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shugo.html">Shugo</a> (provincial constable), was granted the rank, and gradually, dominant <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> (feudal lord) other than the Ashikaga clan began to be granted the rank. In particular, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Appointment (Ninkan).html">appointment</a> of the rank from the beginning to the middle of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Sengoku Period (period of warring states) (Japan).html">Sengoku Period</a> (Period of Warring States) includes <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshioki OUCHI.html">Yoshioki OUCHI</a> who prospered as kanreidai (deputy <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Kanrei.html">kanrei</a>), <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Motonobu TAKEDA.html">Motonobu TAKEDA</a> of Wakasa Province, and Yoshisuke ITO of Hyuga Province. Among <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> other than tenkabito (person becoming the ruler of the country) and their families, Jusanmi was the highest rank, but <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshitaka OUCHI.html">Yoshitaka OUCHI</a> was promoted from Jusanmi to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Junii (Junior Second Rank).html">Junii</a> (Junior Second Rank), and with time, there were more cases going beyond Jusanmi. <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Nobunaga ODA.html">Nobunaga ODA</a>, who later becomes <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Udaijin (Minister of the Right).html">Udaijin</a> also at one time held this rank, and his eldest son <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Nobutada ODA.html">Nobutada ODA</a>'s rank was Jusanmi Sakone no chujo (Middle Captain of the Left Division of Inner Palace Guards). After <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI.html">Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI</a>, who became the first Kanpaku (chief advisor to the Emperor) from a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> family, conquered the country, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> were increasingly promoted to high ranks, and Sanmi was granted to the clan and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> such as Kagemasa UESUGI and Terumoto MORI. Under the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Edo bakufu.html">Edo bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>), the inheriting grandson of the seii taishogun (literally, "great general who subdues the barbarians"), Tokugawa gosanke (three privileged branches of Tokugawa family), the gosankyo (three Tokugawa clan families who separated from the clan), and the lord of Kaga Domain who wedded the daughter of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> were granted the rank. </p>
<p>In modern days, Jusanmi corresponds to Shishaku (viscount) in <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Shakui.html">shakui</a> (the rank of nobility), and ranks granted to bukekazoku (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> families from the Edo period becoming nobles in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period) who had many Shishaku were notable. In the ranks for military personnel, it corresponded to Army General. Today, it is commonly granted posthumously to persons who made similar achievements as former Diet members, prefectural governors, or scholars who received conferment of the Kunnito (Order of Second Class). </p>
