<h1>Obanyaku (大番役)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Obanyaku was the post assigned to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> from non-capital areas to maintain the security of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> during the later Heian to early Muromachi period or to maintain the security of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> city during the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period. </p>
<p>When <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Goseibai-shikimoku (code of conduct for samurai).html">Goseibai-shikimoku</a> (code of conduct for <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a>) was establshed during the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period, it was explicitly written in Taibon sankajo (three basic rights of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a>, provincial constable) that obanyaku was a post to be assumed by <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Gokenin.html">gokenin</a> (an immediate vassal of the shogunate in the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> and Muromachi through Edo periods). During the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> and later periods, the post was assigned to each province, and shogo in each province was responsible for selecting the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Gokenin.html">gokenin</a> to assume the post in the province (oban saisoku). In the period of the Northern and Southern Courts (Japan), it became almost extinct. </p>
<p><a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> obanyaku<br/>
The post to guard the palace and the residences of special imperial family members (and later those of the Fujiwara clan) in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> was called Kyoto Obanyaku. With the length of the duty being three years during the Heian period, it was a large burden on <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> in non-capital regions, and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/MINAMOTO no Yoritomo.html">MINAMOTO no Yoritomo</a> reduced it to half a year, being further reduced to three months in the middle of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> period when the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> side became more influential than the kuge (court noble) side. </p>
<p>However, towards the end of the Heian period, it gave a chance fo <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> from non-capital provinces to gain a connection with kuge in the capital, and some <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> could obtain an official rank through their connections. In other words, there was the following merit in assuming the post: A person at the obanyaku post could be assigned to the post of suke (provisional governor), gon-no-suke (provisional vice governor) or jo (secretary of provincial offices) in his original province, gaining a position in the imperial court and having his control right backed by the authority of the imperial court. 
<br/>Also, some at the post learned culture in the capital, such as making waka poems and brought it back to their original provinces<br/>
</p>
<p>There were also some demerits: For example, the post of obanyaku was sometimes assumed not by the head of a clan but by his son, and in such a case, when the head of the clan died while his son was in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, it sometimes happened that the postion of head was deprived of by his younger brother or his uncle (an example: <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Hirotsune KAZUSA.html">Hirotsune KAZUSA</a>). In addition, it also happened that, while a father, the head of a clan, was in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and his son in his original province, the father could not speedily handle disturbances that occurred in the province (an example: Shigetada HATAKEYAMA). </p>
<p><a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> obanyaku<br/>
The post for guarding the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>) in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> was called <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> obanyaku. It is concerned with the service of favors and services. In the feaudal system based on favors and services, it became a natural post for the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Gokenin.html">gokenin</a> who served the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>. </p>
