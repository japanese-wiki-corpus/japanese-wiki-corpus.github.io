<h1>Sobayonin (lord chamberlain) (側用人)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Sobayonin was a post in the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> and domains in the Edo period. The official post name was Osoba-goyonin. </p>
<p><h3>Sobayonin in domains</h3>
</p>
<p>The Sobayonin placed in domains was sometimes called Osoba for short. For lords, there were the public sphere and the private sphere, and Karo managed whole domain administration, while the Sobayonin managed the family affairs of the lord family and played a role of a secretary of the lord and his heir. However, the name and jobs of the Sobayonin were not universal, and importance of the post depended on the domain. </p>
<p>In the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>, the Sobayonin sometimes gained more power than Roju (the second highest post in the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> government or a person (s) in the post), but in domains, such an example scarcely existed. However, because of the characteristics of the post, a person from a low social standing family was often appointed to the Sobayonin post when he was a competent close confidant trusted deeply by the lord, so the load of the post was invariably heavy. In some domains, a Sobayonin officer was also provided with the title of Osoba-goyo-toritsugi, and in this case, the function of the officer was almost the same as those of a Sobayonin officer in the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>. </p>
<p>The Sobayonin officer in domains are generally selected from at least <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Kyujin.html">Kyujin</a> (lower-ranked one of the upper class retainers) or upper class retainers ranked at <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Moshitsugi.html">moshitsugi</a> (or toritsugi) (an official for conveying a message). 
<br/>Furthermore, in many domains throughout the nation, heirs of senior retainers served as <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Kosho.html">Kosho</a> (pages) or Sobayonin officers when they were in the heyazumi status (living in their parents' houses) before inherited their family head positions<br/>
The Sobayonin post was mostly placed under the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Yonin (steward).html">Yonin</a> post, but in some domains, for example, the Mito domain and the Kaga domain, it was placed above the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Yonin (steward).html">Yonin</a> post. Compared to the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Yonin (steward).html">Yonin</a> post and the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Banto.html">Banto</a> post, the status level depended on the domain. <h3>Sobayonin in the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Edo bakufu.html">Edo bakufu</a></h3>
</p>
<p>Sobayonin officers in the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Edo bakufu.html">Edo bakufu</a> were close confidants of seii taishogun (literally, "the great general who was to subdue the barbarians"), and played a role of informing Roju or other officers of instructions from <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a>. A rice yield of 10,000 koku (approx. 180 liters/koku) was given to the post. Famous Sobayonin officers were Yoshiyasu YANAGISAWA in the era of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Tsunayoshi TOKUGAWA.html">Tsunayoshi TOKUGAWA</a>, the fifth <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>; <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Akifusa MANABE.html">Akifusa MANABE</a> in the eras of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Ienobu TOKUGAWA.html">Ienobu TOKUGAWA</a>, the sixth <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Ietsugu TOKUGAWA.html">Ietsugu TOKUGAWA</a>, the seventh <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>; Tadamitsu OKA in the era of Ieshige TOKUGAWA, the ninth <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>; <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Okitsugu TANUMA.html">Okitsugu TANUMA</a> in the era of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Ieharu TOKUGAWA.html">Ieharu TOKUGAWA</a>, the tenth <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>; and Tadaakira MIZUNO in the era of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Ienari TOKUGAWA.html">Ienari TOKUGAWA</a>, the eleventh <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>. </p>
<p>In the early Edo period, officers in this post, called kinju shuttoyaku (an attendant to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a>) at that time, were selected from 5000-koku class <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Hatamoto (direct retainers of shogun).html">hatamoto</a> (direct retainers of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>) who were involved in important affairs as close aides of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a>, and in particular, played a role of relaying important matters. After becoming the fifth <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>, Yoshitsuna made Narisada MAKINO, who was Karo (chief retainer) of the Tatebayashi domain at that time, succeed the former kinju shuttoyaku post as the newly named 'Sobayonin' post, converting his status to Fudai <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> (a <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> who had belonged to the Tokugawa group before the Battle of Sekigahara), and made him handle important matters, preparing for dictatorship. </p>
<p>In 1684, Masatoshi HOTTA, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Tairo (chief minister).html">Tairo</a> (the highest post in the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> government to the person in the post) was slain with a sword in the Edo castle by Masayasu INABA, his cousin and a <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Wakadoshiyori.html">wakadoshiyori</a> officer. This incident led the goyobeya room (office room) of Roju to be moved to a place far away from the residence of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>, in the pretext of worrying about his safety. Therefore, power of the Sobayonin officer, who mediated between the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> and the Roju and played the role of relaying instructions from <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> to Roju, increased suddenly. The politics style which the government was operated by Sobayonin rather than by Roju was called 'Sobayonin seiji' (Sobayonin-based politics) by historians in later eras. <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> exercised dictatorship through the Sobayonin officer, and the officer came to be used by <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> as a means of containing power of Roju. </p>
<p>After Narisada MAKINO retired, Tsunayoshi appointed Yoshiyasu YANAGISAWA, who had been MAKINO's close aide since MAKINO was Karo of the Tatebayashi domain, and showed more favor to Yoshiyasu than to Makino. In addition, around this time, Tsunayoshi started losing enthusiasm for politics, and the intention of Yanagisawa was sometimes conveyed as that of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>. Furthermore, it became custom that the Sobayonin officer could refuse a matter which Roju requested to relay to the shobun but the Sobayonin officer was against it. Although having never been appointed to Roju, Yanagisawa was given Kamiza (seat of honor) of Roju and the title of Roju-kau (Roju level), occupying the highest post of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> government both in name and reality. Although no such a title was provided for <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Akifusa MANABE.html">Akifusa MANABE</a> in the next generation, he possessed more power than Roju accutually. In the Tsunayoshi era and later, the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> operation was conducted mainly through Sobayonin (or Goyotoritsugi), completing the political style called dictatorship by <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>. </p>
<p>The eighth <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Yoshimune TOKUGAWA.html">Yoshimune TOKUGAWA</a>, who adopted as his slogan 'Everything should be done as <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Ieyasu TOKUGAWA.html">Ieyasu TOKUGAWA</a> specified,' abolished this system, which did not exist when the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> started, immediately after he assumed the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> post, gaining the confidence of Fudai <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a>. However, he established the Osoba-goyotoritsugi post for relaying messages between <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a> and Roju to appoint Hisamichi KANO and Ujinori ARIMA, his confidants who accompanied Yoshimune from the Kishu domain and became retainers of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Hatamoto (direct retainers of shogun).html">Hatamoto</a>), to the post, and operated the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> through them, retaining the 'Sobayonin seiji' effectively. However, Yoshimune did not make them <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> immediately after appointing them to the new post, and did not permit them to deliver political remarks that were allowed for Roju nor to refuse relaying messages from Roju to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a>. </p>
<p>When the ninth shogun,Ieshige, who is said to have suffered from speech disorder, became the ninth <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>, only his confidants who had been his attendantspersons could understand his ambiguous speech. Therefore, Tadamitsu OOKA, one of his confidants, became in charge of important matters, restoring the sobayonin system. However, Ieshege and Ieharu, the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> who succeeded the Ieshige, did not want to be involved in political matters actively, therefore, it can also be said that the Sobayonin officers, such as OOKA and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Okitsugu TANUMA.html">Okitsugu TANUMA</a>, came to have strong power naturally. Of them, Tanuma was the first person who officially assumed Roju from Sobayonin through Roju-kaku. </p>
