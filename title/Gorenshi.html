<h1>Gorenshi (御連枝)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Gorenshi refers to brothers of prestigious families such as the Imperial Family and families of kuge (court nobles) and seii taishogun (literally, "great general who subdues the barbarians"), and so on. </p>
<p>Especially in the Edo period, it referred to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> (a feudal lord) who moved out from the Tokugawa gosanke (three privileged branch families of Tokugawa) and founded its own domain. Families of gorenshi used the surname of Matsudaira. When gosanke did not have an heir, a new lord of the gosanke was sometimes selected from this gorenshi. </p>
