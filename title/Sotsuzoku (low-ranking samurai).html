<h1>Sotsuzoku (low-ranking samurai) (卒族)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Sotsuzoku was a name of social status in the early Meiji period. Low-ranking samurai called differently as Doshin or Ashigaru (a foot soldier) in each domain, who did not have the status of samurai, were examples. In 1870, the designation started; however, it was abolished two years later. </p>
<p>In the abolition of Sotsuzoku, the hereditary Sotsuzoku was incorporated into Shizoku (the samurai class), and the one-off generation of Sotsuzoku into Heimin (commoner). </p>
