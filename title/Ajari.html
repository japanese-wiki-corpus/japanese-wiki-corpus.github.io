<h1>Ajari (阿闍梨)</h1>
<p>Ajari (also Azari, Sanskrit: acarya, also transliterated as Ajariya) means a "model/example" in Sanskrit, and is a master who is an example to his disciples and teaches the dharma. </p>
<p>In the vedic religion, this term referred to a leader who instructed his followers using examples from the vedas, while in Nikaya Buddhism, it referred to a high-ranking monk who led monks in training and instructed them in doctrine; so while the exact meaning varied according to the particular religion, the term Ajari was used in several instances in the sense of leadership. </p>
<p>In esoteric Buddhism, it sometimes refers to Vairocana and the other Buddhas, but in general it is a title for priests in a high position who should be an example for the other monks; in Japan in the Tendai and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Shingon.html">Shingon</a> sects, it is a position given to noble monks, especially to those who conduct rites in ceremonies involving the emperor. </p>
<p>Among the monks called Ajari in Japan are:<br/>
Kyoju Ajari – Teaches the Dharma;<br/>
</p>
<p>Demp Ajari - Those who have received a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/Buddhism/Kanjo.html">kanjo</a> (a ceremony to be the successor) of the denpo (all of the necessary elements for preservation and development of the techniques and sutras). </p>

</p>
<p><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>'s famous sweets, Ajari-mochi, are so named because they resemble the wicker hats worn by the Ajari doing the 1000-day circumambulation at Enryaku-ji temple on <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Mt. Hiei.html">Mt. Hiei</a>. </p>
