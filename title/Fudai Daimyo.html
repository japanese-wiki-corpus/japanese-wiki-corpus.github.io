<p></p>
<p>Fudai <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> were a class of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> (Japanese feudal lords) in the Edo period defined according to their ancestry. </p>
<p>Originally called 'fudai-no-shin (hereditary vassals),' fudai <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> were <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> who had been vassals of the Tokugawa clan for generations (the reason these <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> were given this name was that a fudai, which can be written as 譜第 or 譜代 in Japanese, is a written genealogy proving one's ancestry), and were involved in all aspects of managing their master's affairs, from running his household to the supervision of estates and commerce within his territory. Fudai <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> had a strong vassal relationship with their master, so they were often reproached if they switched allegiance to a new master in the event of their master losing power. </p>
<p>Summary<br/>
The origin of fudai <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> comes from the fact that <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Ieyasu TOKUGAWA.html">Ieyasu TOKUGAWA</a>, when transferred to Kanto region under the TOYOTOMI regime, granted land to build a castle and a position of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> to his major military commanders in the hereditary vassalage, thus making them serve as hanpei (the guarding wall of the sovereign) to support the TOKUGAWA clan. On the other hand, the other vassals were regrouped to be the direct controlled army of the TOKUGAWA clan, thus becoming the roots of the later-established <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Hatamoto (direct retainers of shogun).html">hatamoto</a> (bannermen, or direct retainers of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a>, with the privilege to have an audience with the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a>), <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Gokenin.html">gokenin</a> (housemen, or direct retainers of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>, without the privilege to have an audience with the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a>) and early-modern <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Gokenin.html">gokenin</a>. </p>
<p>Definition of Fudai <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">Daimyo</a><br/>
</p>
<p>Fudai <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> were the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a>, whom the TOKUGAWA clan had promoted, except <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/family/Shinpan (Tokugawas relatives).html">shinpan</a> (TOKUGAWA's blood relatives), tozama <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> and their branch domains (branch families). </p>
<p>Fudai <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> were the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a>, whom the TOKUGAWA clan had promoted from among the TOKUGAWA vassals at the service from before the Battle of Sekigahara (Sekigahara no Kassen). </p>
<p>Fudai <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> were those who were eligible for a key post of the shogunate. </p>
<p>For <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Hatamoto (direct retainers of shogun).html">hatamoto</a> who were granted a larger stipend to become <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> or those who were newly promoted by the Shogunate to become <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a>—such as the leaders of the HOTTA, INABA and YANAGISAWA clans and Ujinori ARIMA, all of whom were born <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Baishin (indirect vassal).html">baishin</a> (indirect vassals)—the first definition above applies, so they were classified as fudai <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a>. On the other hand, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> who belonged to a branch family of tozama <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> or those who had originally been tozama <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> but had been stripped of their position, privileges, and property due to a sanction called <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kaieki.html">kaieki</a> and then regained power later, such as Muneshige TACHIBANA and Naoyori SHINJO, were classified as tozama. Families founded by Ieyasu's patrilineal descendants were in principle called <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/family/Shinpan (Tokugawas relatives).html">shinpan</a>, but not fudai. </p>
<p>Another example shows that, as in the case of the Aizu-Matsudaiara family and the Takatsukasa-Matsudaira family, some families which should have been classified as fudai <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> could irregularly be classified as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/family/Shinpan (Tokugawas relatives).html">shinpan</a> because of being the TOKUGAWA's blood relatives. By contrast, Narihiro HACHISUKA, a biological son of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>, was adopted by tozama, and so remained his status. When illegitimate children of Gosanke (the three privileged branches of the TOKUGAWA family including the OWARI, KII and MITO families) and Gosankyo (the three privileged branches of the TOKUGAWA family including the TAYASU, HITOTSUBASHI and SHIMIZU families) were adopted by fudai <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a>, they did not become <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/family/Shinpan (Tokugawas relatives).html">shinpan</a> in terms of status, but they were often treated as equally well as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/family/Shinpan (Tokugawas relatives).html">shinpan</a>. </p>
<p>Besides, some families which were originally tozama <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> could irregularly be treated as fudai because of blood relationship or great achievements for the shogunate. They were called "negai-fudai (jun-fudai <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> or quasi fudai <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a>)." Examples of the negai-fudai included the WAKISAKA clan, Naeki domain, the TOZAWA clan, the ARIMA clan, the HORI clan, the SOMA clan, the KATO clan in Yoshiakira KATO's line, and the AKITA clan. </p>
<p>At Edo-jo castle, the aforementioned <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> attended shikoseki (anteroom seats for feudal lords and direct retainers of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> at Edo-jo castle) which were selected in accordance with kakaku (family status), including "tamari-no-ma" chamber, "teikan-no-ma" chamber, "kari-no-ma" chamber, and "kiku-no-ma hiro-en (kiku no ma enkyo)" chamber. </p>
<p><h3>Narrowly-Defined TOKUGAWA Fudai</h3>
</p>
<p>Narrowly-defined TOKUGAWA fudai consisted of the families that had been in hereditary vassalage to the MATSUDAIRA family, and the families that were promoted by <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Ieyasu TOKUGAWA.html">Ieyasu TOKUGAWA</a>. 
<br/>Those families were further divided according to the length of vassalage period into the 'Anjo fudai (fudai <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> who had been serving Ieyasu since he was in Anjo castle),' the 'Okazaki-jo fudai (fudai <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> who had been serving Ieyasu since he was in Okazaki-jo castle)' and the 'Sunpu-jo fudai (fudai <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> who had been serving Ieyasu since he was in Sunpu-jo castle.'<br/>
</p>
<p>As the longest-serving fudai, the Anjo fudai were favorably treated at the shikoseki, and in case they should have been sanctioned, their family names were in many cases restored in some form soon. However, Yasunaga ISHIKAWA and Yasukatsu ISHIKAWA of the Anjo-fudai born ISHIKAWA clan ended in tozama <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> due to their background that they had betrayed Ieyasu once and switched the sides before finally joining the Ieyasu's Eastern Army. </p>
<p>Various Theories of Classifying Fudai<br/>
</p>
<p>"Ryuei <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Hikan (low ranking clerks).html">hikan</a>" (a series of books giving an account of political annual events, custom, bylaw, formality, historical events, precedent and ritual complied in the mid-eighteenth century) divided the TOKUGAWA fudai into three groups of the Anjo fudai (consisting of seven families), the Okazaki fudai (consisting of sixteen families) and the Suruga fudai, and later, into four groups with an additional family. </p>
<p>"Mikawa <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Monogatari.html">Monogatari</a> (Mikawa Stories)" written by Hikozaemon OKUBO referred to the classification of the fudai into three groups of the Anjo fudai, the Yamanaka fudai and the Okazaki fudai, wherein as with the "Ryuei <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Hikan (low ranking clerks).html">hikan</a>," the longest-serving Anjo fudai was said to have served Nobumitsu MATSUDAIRA, Chikatada MATSUDAIRA, Nobutada MATSUDAIRA, Kiyoyasu MATSUDAIRA and Hirotada MATSUDAIRA. In addition, the Yamanaka fudai and the Okazaki fudai had entered vassal relationship to the MATSUDAIRA since the time Kiyoyasu had captured Yamanaka-jo Castle and Okazaki-jo Castle to be made his honryo (the main domain). </p>
<p>"Mikawa Go <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/Shinto/Fudoki (description of regional climate, culture, etc.).html">Fudoki</a> (The Topographical Records of Mikawa Province)" had an article under the heading of Kiyoyasu MATSUDAIRA with the description of the 'seven Anjo fudai families or the fudai of Okazaki and Yamanaka.'<br/>
</p>
<p>Incidentally, other than the above, some studies by the scholars of the later generations occasionally used the terms 'Matsudaira-go (Matsudaira village) fudai' and 'Iwatsu fudai,' but these were not found in either "Ryuei <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Hikan (low ranking clerks).html">hikan</a>" or "Mikawa <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/literature/Monogatari.html">Monogatari</a>." Since the parent of the TOKUGAWA family was the ANJO-MATSUDAIRA family, vassals having served the ANJO-MATSUDAIRA family were historically regarded as the longest-serving, who were followed by vassals having served the other cadet branches of the house of MATSUDAIRA. The terms 'Matsudaira-go fudai' and 'Iwatsu fudai' were both newly created by a scholar taking into consideration of the whole Matsudaira clan including the Anjo-Matsudaira family, thereby failing to be a historical term. </p>
<p>The Role of Fudai <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">Daimyo</a><br/>
First, fudai <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> are characterized by being eligible to an important post of the cabinet officials of the shogunate including the posts of roju (senior councilors in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Edo bakufu.html">Edo bakufu</a>) and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Wakadoshiyori.html">wakadoshiyori</a> (a managerial position in the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Edo bakufu.html">Edo bakufu</a>). As the shogunate was supposedly the household manager of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> family, there was such a strictly abided unwritten rule that all important posts of the shogunate went to fudai <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a>, except for the cases of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Bakumatsu.html">bakumatsu</a> period (the last days of the shogunate) and the Ochi-Matsudaira family. It is a major characteristic of the TOKUGAWA regime to appoint members from <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/family/Shinpan (Tokugawas relatives).html">shinpan</a> to the posts of the shogunate, and to avoid some powerful tozama <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> with a large domain from joining the politics of the shogunate as a political adviser. </p>
<p>Some points out that it was an exception that Masayuki HOSHINA served the fourth <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Ietsuna TOKUGAWA.html">Ietsuna TOKUGAWA</a> as his koken (the guardian), but this guardianship was unofficial because Masayuki was not appointed to any post of the shogunate. 
<br/>(A likely explanation is that Masayuki was appointed to the post of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Tairo (chief minister).html">tairo</a> or the official post of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>'s guardian, but this is not applicable to the case of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/family/Shinpan (Tokugawas relatives).html">shinpan</a> <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> becoming a cabinet official of the shogunate, because the Hoshina family, which became the Aizu-Matsudaira family later, was not a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/family/Shinpan (Tokugawas relatives).html">shinpan</a> yet at that time.)<br/>
</p>
<p>Another role of fudai <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> was to keep a close watch on tozama <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a>. When tozama <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> and fudai <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> were stationed in the same province, the fudai <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> were not required to stay in Edo under the sankin kotai system (the alternate residence system), but instead had to remain at their residence (in their hometown). However, if a tozama <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> was the 'lord of the province' and possessed the entire province as his fiefdom, a neighboring fudai <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> or <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/family/Shinpan (Tokugawas relatives).html">shinpan</a> would perform his role during his absence. </p>
<p>The Eighteen Matsudaira families and the Hisamatsu-Matsudaira<br/>
According to the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Edo bakufu.html">Edo bakufu</a>, when a member from the eighteen Matsudaira families which were <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Ieyasu TOKUGAWA.html">Ieyasu TOKUGAWA</a>'s patrilineal relatives became <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a>, he was not a '<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/family/Shinpan (Tokugawas relatives).html">shinpan</a>' but 'fudai <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a>.'<br/>
The eighteen Matsudaira families had had the same roots and split into branches by the time of Kiyoyasu MATSUDAIRA, who was Ieyasu's grandfather. </p>
<p>The Hisamatsu-Matsudaira family of Ieyasu's younger maternal half-brother was, needless to say, a fudai <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> but not a <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/family/Shinpan (Tokugawas relatives).html">shinpan</a>. Sadanobu MATSUDAIRA, who was a grandchild of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshimune TOKUGAWA.html">Yoshimune TOKUGAWA</a>, was adopted by the Hisamatsu-Matsudaira family of Shirakawa Domain of Mutsu Province, and therefore, Sadanobu carried out the Kansei Reform as a roju from fudai <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a>. </p>
<p>Among the members of the Hisamatsu-Matsudaira family, the family line including the dominant lord of Iyo-Matsuyama Domain of Iyo Province and the lord of Kuwana Domain of Ise Province (who was transferred from Takada han to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/geographical/Shirakawa (the surroundings of the old capital, Kyoto).html">Shirakawa</a> han temporarily) was fudai <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a>, but treated as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/family/Shinpan (Tokugawas relatives).html">shinpan</a> because the both lord's families adopted sons from Munetake TAYASU as their lords, respectively. The other domains related to the Hisamatsu-Matsudaira family (<1. Ogaki Domain of Mino Province => Komoro Domain of Shinano Province => Nasu Domain of Shimotsuke Province=> Nagashima Domain of Ise Province; transfer due to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Kaieki.html">kaieki</a>> 2. Imabari Domain of Iyo Province; 3. Tako Domain of Shimofusa Province had fudai <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> as their lords. <h3>A List of Fudai <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">Daimyo</a></h3>
</p>
<p>The following ordering other than that of the MATSUDAIRA clan complies with "Ryuei <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Hikan (low ranking clerks).html">hikan</a>":<br/>
(See above for a description of Jun-fudai <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> [not distinguished from fudai in the Edo period].)<br/>
