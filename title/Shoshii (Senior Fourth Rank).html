<h1>Shoshii (Senior Fourth Rank) (正四位)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Shoshii (Senior Fourth Rank) is one of the ranks in the ranking order (ikai) and the ranking order of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> gods (<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Shinto/Shinkai.html">shinkai</a>) in Japan. </p>
<p>It is the rank below Jusanminoge (Lower Grade Junior Third Rank) and Jushiinojo (Upper Junior Fourth Rank). In the case of posthumous honors, it is called Zoshoshii (Zo Senior Fourth Rank). </p>
<p>Shoshii (Senior Fourth Rank)<br/>
Shoshii was divided into upper and lower, and ranked below <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Jusanmi.html">Jusanmi</a> no ge and above Jushiinojo under the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Ritsuryo.html">Ritsuryo</a> system. With regard to the order of merit, it is equivalent to the Third Order of Merit, while with regard to official ranks, Shoshiinojo (Upper Grade Fourth Rank) was equivalent to Nakatsukasasho (Inner Ministry) and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Sangi.html">Sangi</a> (advisor), and Shoshiinoge (Lower Grade Fourth Rank) was equivalent to the posts of Kotaishinofu (one of the teachers of the crown prince) and Kyo (Minister) who was the head of the 8 Ministries - Ministry of Ministry of Administration (Shikibusho), Ministry of the Ceremonies (Jibusho), Ministry of Registration (Minbusho), Ministry of the Military (<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Hyobusho (Ministry of Military).html">Hyobusho</a>), Ministry of Justice (Gyobusho), Ministry of Finance (Okurasho), Minister of the Imperial Palace (Kunaikyo). </p>
<p>As with <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Jushii.html">Jushii</a> (Junior Fourth Rank), it is fundamental that the title of respect, "ason," of those who are ranked in Shii (Fourth Rank) is put after their surname and imina, as done by the self-declared ason (a prestigious title in the Nara period). One example of this was Shoshiinoge Iyo no kami MINAMOTO no Yoriyoshi Ason. </p>
<p>However, even if they were ranked Shoshii, when they became <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Sangi.html">sangi</a>, and were raised to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Kugyo.html">kugyo</a>, the title of respect was 'ason' after their surname and 'kyo' after their imina. </p>
<p>Shoshii was the peak rank, i.e. the highest rank, for a family which was not permitted to ascend to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Kugyo.html">kugyo</a>, and many leading warriors of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Seiwa-Genji (Minamoto clan).html">Seiwa-Genji</a> (Minamoto clan) and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Kawachi-Genji.html">Kawachi-Genji</a> (Minamoto clan) were prominent. In the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Seiwa-Genji (Minamoto clan).html">Seiwa-Genji</a>, MINAMOTO no Mitsunaka who was a son of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/MINAMOTO no Tsunemoto.html">MINAMOTO no Tsunemoto</a>, and Mitsunaka's eldest son, the leader of the Settsu-Genji (Minamoto clan), <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/MINAMOTO no Yorimitsu.html">MINAMOTO no Yorimitsu</a>, and Mitsunaka's fourth son, the leader of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Kawachi-Genji.html">Kawachi-Genji</a>, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/MINAMOTO no Yorinobu.html">MINAMOTO no Yorinobu</a>, as well as leaders of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Kawachi-Genji.html">Kawachi-Genji</a> such as <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/MINAMOTO no Yoriyoshi.html">MINAMOTO no Yoriyoshi</a> and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/MINAMOTO no Yoshiie.html">MINAMOTO no Yoshiie</a> ascended to that rank. In the Kanmu-Heishi (Taira clan), <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/TAIRA no Tadamori.html">TAIRA no Tadamori</a> from the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Ise-Heishi (Taira clan).html">Ise-Heishi</a> (Taira clan) ascended to Shoshii and was named Gyobukyo (official of the Ministry of Justice). </p>
<p>Moreover, as it became a custom that <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Konoe no daisho.html">Konoe no daisho</a> (Major Captain of Palace Guard) who was originally supposed to be ranked as <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Jusanmi.html">Jusanmi</a> (Junior Third Rank) also held the post of Minister, it also became a rule that someone ranked as <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Jusanmi.html">Jusanmi</a> (Junior Third Rank) was named Konoe no chujo (Middle Captain of Palace Guard) and became Sanmi chujo (Third Rank Middle Captain), and someone ranked as Shoshii (Senior Fourth Rank) often came to be named Konoe shosho (Minor Captain of Palace Guard) such as Hideyasu YUKI. </p>
<p>In the Edo period, the following <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> families were allowed to ascend to the rank: the head of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/family/Mito Tokugawa family.html">Mito Tokugawa family</a> of Mito Domain from three branch families, Echizen Matsudaira family of the Fukui Domain (4 out of 15 heads of family) from the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Kamon (family).html">kamon</a> <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a>, Ii clan of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Hikone Domain.html">Hikone Domain</a> from the fudai <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> (3 out of 17 heads of family), Maeda clan of Kaga Domain and Shimazu clan of Satsuma Domain from the tozama <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> (only Narinobu SHIMAZU of 12 heads of family), and DATE clan of Sendai Domain (only Yoshikuni DATE of successive daimyos). </p>
<p>After the beginning of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period, Shoshii (Senior Fourth Rank) was conferred as a posthumous honor on those who had accomplished a great deed, except for those who had already received a rank above <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Jusanmi.html">Jusanmi</a> (Junior Third Rank), <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/family/Kazoku.html">kazoku</a> (new nobility) such as <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Kugyo.html">kugyo</a> and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a>, and especially on people of merit who had died during the 'Revere the Emperor, Expel the Barbarian'-Period and the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Meiji Restoration (Meiji-ishin).html">Meiji Restoration</a>. </p>
<p>The government regarded Shoshii (Senior Fourth Rank) as the first rank awarded to the deputy secretary and those of the rank of General (taisho) in the Japanese Imperial Army and Navy. In addition, there are many examples where Diet members were awarded a rank between <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Juichii.html">Juichii</a> (Junior First Rank) and Shoshii (Senior Fourth Rank) according to their careers and achievements. </p>
<p>Under the current Honors System, when those credited with the Second Order of Merit die, they are awarded the rank.. Major examples are members of the House of Councilors and university professor with great achievements. </p>
