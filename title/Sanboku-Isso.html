<h1>Sanboku-Isso (三木一草)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>"Sanboku-Isso" was the name given to the four meritorious retainers who received the Emperor Godaigo's favor under the Kemmu Restoration. Their names were <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Masashige KUSUNOKI.html">Masashige KUSUNOKI</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Chikamitsu YUKI.html">Chikamitsu YUKI</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Nagatoshi NAWA.html">Nagatoshi NAWA</a> and Tadaaki CHIKUSA, and the title of Sanboku-Isso came from all of their names collectively. </p>
<p>The characters used for Masashige's family name were"楠木"(camphor tree) which are read as "kusuno-ki." The characters for Chikamitsu's family name were"結城" and are read as "yu-ki." Nagatoshi was nicknamed "ho-ki" being that he was from Hoki Province. Characters for Tadaaki's family name were "千種" and are read as "chi-gusa" ("gusa" having the same pronunciation as "kusa" which means "grass" in Japanese); their title "Sanboku-Isso" was coined after their names as the character "木" (boku) is also read as "ki" which means "tree," leading to "Sanboku-Isso" which literally means "three trees and one grass." </p>
<p>Common points of the four Sanboku-Isso:<br/>
Under the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>) system, they would not have succeeded due to their origins. </p>
<p>All four rose to high ranks by winning the "Emperor's favor." </p>
<p>Their periods of prosperity were extremely short. (All four lost their lives during the Kenmu Era in the battle with Ashikaga clan in 1336). </p>
<p>Losing the lives of the four Sanboku-Isso military commanders at an early stage in the battle between the Southern and Northern Dynasties led to an extreme military disadvantage for the Southern Dynasty. </p>
