<h1>Kyoto Shoshidai (京都所司代)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>When Nobunaga ODA went to the capital with Yoshiaki ASHIKAGA in hand and put Kyoto under his dominion, he made his vassal Sadakatsu MURAI the Kyoto Shoshidai, in charge of maintaining the peace in Kyoto, imitating the organization of the Muromachi Shogunate. Sadakatsu died in battle at Nijo-jo Castle along with Nobunaga's heir, Nobutada ODA, in the Incident at Honnoji, in which Mitsuhide AKECHI killed Nobunaga on June 2, 1582. While Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI ruled Kyoto after Nobunaga's death, Sadanari KUWABARA, Ietsugu SUGIHARA, and Nagamasa ASANO (all three in the period from 1582 to 1583), and later Geni MAEDA served as Kyoto Shoshidai. It had been alternated to both Mitsunari ISHIDA and Nagamori MASITA in around 1954 (Letter from Sakihisa KONOE to Nobusuke KONOE in August of the same year, in the collection of Yomei Bunko). This was in keeping with the Muromachi Shogunate's titles. </p>
<p>Kyoto Shoshidai was the department that was responsible for keeping the peace in Kyoto in the Edo period. That is the main subject of this article. </p>
<p>Kyoto Shoshidai was the post that was responsible for keeping the peace in Kyoto in the Edo period. </p>
<p>Shoshi<br/>
Originally, a Shoshi was the leader of a Samurai-dokoro and a Shoshidai was his agent; but the Edo Shogunate did not have any Samurai-dokoro. </p>
<p>Edo Period Shoshidai were set up after the pattern of Rokuhara Tandai in the Kamakura Shogunate, or the Shoshidai of the Muromachi Shogunate (under command of the Samurai-dokoro, in charge of security in Kyoto). </p>
<p>The Shoshidai's offices and residence were set up on the north side of Nijo-jo Castle, and did not use Nijo-jo Castle. The Kyoto Gundai was also put in place to govern Kyoto and the surrounding area, but later split into the Kyoto Machibugyo, which was responsible for the city, and the Kyoto Daikan, which managed the surrounding area, the Imperial Household territory, and the Court Noble territory there. </p>
<p>Although he was the overall boss of government officials in Kyoto, and officials such as the Kyoto Machibugyo, in charge of Kyoto city government, and the Kinritsuki, who supervised the Imperial Court and palace, ordinarily followed the Shoshidai's commands, he was under the jurisdiction of the Roju. </p>
<p>Because it was difficult for the Shoshidai to keep the peace in the capital by himself during the period of upheaval at the end of the Edo era, the Kyoto Shugoshoku was put at the highest level of the organization; and the Shoshidai was subordinate to him. </p>
