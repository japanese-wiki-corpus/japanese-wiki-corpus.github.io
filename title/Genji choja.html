<h1>Genji <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Choja.html">choja</a> (源氏長者)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>"Genji <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Choja.html">choja</a>" means the head of the Minamoto clan. In principle, a person who had the highest court rank among the persons of Minamoto clan became Genji <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Choja.html">choja</a>. In the Minamoto clan, Genji <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Choja.html">choja</a> had various authorities relating to religious service, summons, litigations and recommendation of promotion. It is generally believed that Genji <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Choja.html">choja</a> concurrently assumed the position of the betto (superintendent) of both <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/building/Shogakuin.html">Shogakuin</a> (a private school of the Ariwara Family) and Junnain (a family school named for the Summer Palace of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Junna.html">Emperor Junna</a>). However, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Chikafusa KITABATAKE.html">Chikafusa KITABATAKE</a>, who was Genji <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Choja.html">choja</a>, explained in his book "Shokugensho" that being the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/building/Shogakuin.html">Shogakuin</a> betto satisfied the requirement to become Genji <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Choja.html">choja</a> (in this case, the deputy becomes the Junnain betto). </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>Originally, Genji <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Choja.html">choja</a> came from the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Saga-Genji.html">Saga-Genji</a> (Minamoto clan). The first Genji <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Choja.html">choja</a> is believed to have been <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Sadaijin (Minister of the Left).html">Sadaijin</a> (minister of the left) <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/MINAMOTO no Makoto (noble).html">MINAMOTO no Makoto</a> (court noble). However, judging from the fact that the post of Junnain betto was created in 881 and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/building/Shogakuin.html">Shogakuin</a> itself was founded in the same year, it is presumed that either <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/MINAMOTO no Toru.html">MINAMOTO no Toru</a>, who was then the highest-ranking court noble among the people of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Saga-Genji.html">Saga-Genji</a> as well as the whole of Minamoto clan, or his son MINAMOTO no Noboru was the first person who concurrently assumed the betto of both schools and Genji <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Choja.html">choja</a>. Provided, however, that as <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/building/Shogakuin.html">Shogakuin</a> itself was the facility for all of kobetsu-shizoku (families branched out from the Imperial family), there is a possibility that its betto was not Genji <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Choja.html">choja</a> but the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Choja.html">choja</a> of all such families including the Taira clan and the Ariwara clan. In other words, there is a possibility that Genji <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Choja.html">choja</a> was not identical with the betto of both <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/building/Shogakuin.html">Shogakuin</a> and Junnain. 
<br/>(according to "Shigenki" (dated August 1, 1188), <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/MINAMOTO no Michichika.html">MINAMOTO no Michichika</a> mentioned that there were cases where persons whose maternal grandfather belonged to the Minamoto clan were appointed to the betto (of both schools or of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/building/Shogakuin.html">Shogakuin</a>), and cited the name of FUJIWARA no Tasumoto and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/FUJIWARA no Yukinari.html">FUJIWARA no Yukinari</a> as examples. They may have been Genji <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Choja.html">choja</a> concurrently, but there is no firm evidence)<br/>
Further, Genji <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Choja.html">choja</a> in early times were limited to being the court noble of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Saga-Genji.html">Saga-Genji</a> ("<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Saikyuki.html">Saikyuki</a>" volume 13), and the court nobles of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Saga-Genji.html">Saga-Genji</a> dominated this position up to the last court noble of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Saga-Genji.html">Saga-Genji</a>, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/MINAMOTO no Hitoshi.html">MINAMOTO no Hitoshi</a> (provided that FUJIWARA no Tasumoto once assumed this position concurrently with the In no betto (chief administrator of the Retired Emperor's Office). Later, Imperial prince Shigeaki and MINAMOTO no Takaaki (Daigo-Genji), whose maternal grandfather was a person of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Saga-Genji.html">Saga-Genji</a>, were appointed to Genji <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Choja.html">choja</a>. Since then, persons of Daigo-Genji typified by MINAMOTO no Takaaki and those of Uda-Genji typified by <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/MINAMOTO no Masanobu.html">MINAMOTO no Masanobu</a> were appointed to this position alternately. </p>
<p>Thereafter, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/literature/MINAMOTO no Morofusa.html">MINAMOTO no Morofusa</a> (adopted son of kanpaku (chief adviser to the Emperor) <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/FUJIWARA no Yorimichi.html">FUJIWARA no Yorimichi</a>) of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/family/Murakami-Genji (Minamoto clan).html">Murakami-Genji</a> was appointed as Genji <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Choja.html">choja</a>, and since then, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/MINAMOTO no Masasada.html">MINAMOTO no Masasada</a> and his descendants, namely persons of the Koga family, the Horikawa family, the Tsuchimikado family and the Nakanoin family who were deemed as the direct descendants of Morofusa, inherited this position. 
<br/>(except for the case where Michisuke KARAHASHI, a son of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/MINAMOTO no Michichika.html">MINAMOTO no Michichika</a>, and Masanori KARAHASHI, Michisuke's son, were appointed after the death of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/MINAMOTO no Michichika.html">MINAMOTO no Michichika</a>, the case where <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Michiteru KOGA.html">Michiteru KOGA</a>'s son Masatada NAKANOIN (a different family from the Nakanoin family) was appointed in the era of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Kameyama.html">Emperor Kameyama</a>, the case where <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Chikafusa KITABATAKE.html">Chikafusa KITABATAKE</a> of Kitabatake family, a branch family of Nakanoin family, was appointed in the era of the Emperor Godaigo due to the lack of appropriate person in the four families, and the case where Arimitsu ROKUJO of Rokujo family, a branch family of the Koga family, was appointed in the era of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Emperor Komyo.html">Emperor Komyo</a>)<br/>
In 1288, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Michimoto KOGA.html">Michimoto KOGA</a> was appointed to Genji <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Choja.html">choja</a> for the first time. Thanks to the extinction of both families of Horikawa and Tsuchimikado, the decline of Nakanoin family and the political maneuver by Arimitsu ROKUJO, who had a sense of crisis for the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Appointment (Ninkan).html">appointment</a> of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Chikafusa KITABATAKE.html">Chikafusa KITABATAKE</a> and Arimitsu ROKUJO, the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Monopolization.html">monopolization</a> of Genji <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Choja.html">Choja</a> by the Koga family of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/family/Murakami-Genji (Minamoto clan).html">Murakami-Genji</a> became firm in the Muromachi period. </p>
<p><a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Yoshimitsu ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshimitsu ASHIKAGA</a> of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Seiwa-Genji (Minamoto clan).html">Seiwa-Genji</a> became Genji chaja for the first time as Buke-Genji (Minamoto clan as <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> families). The Ashikaga Shogunal family and the Tokugawa Shogunal family starting from <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Ieyasu TOKUGAWA.html">Ieyasu TOKUGAWA</a> became Genji <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Choja.html">choja</a> while being <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> family (they insisted that they were the descendants of the Nitta family of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Seiwa-Genji (Minamoto clan).html">Seiwa-Genji</a>). After Yoshimitsu, however, only four of the Ashikaga <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> were appointed to Genji <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Choja.html">choja</a>, namely <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Yoshimochi ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshimochi ASHIKAGA</a>, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Yoshinori ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshinori ASHIKAGA</a>, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Yoshimasa ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshimasa ASHIKAGA</a> and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Yoshitane ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshitane ASHIKAGA</a>, and the total number was five persons inclusive of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Yoshihisa ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshihisa ASHIKAGA</a>, who was de facto <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Choja.html">choja</a> (He served as the betto of both Junnain and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/building/Shogakuin.html">Shogakuin</a>. Some people asserts that he served as Genji-choja as well). Actually, Ashikaga family of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/emperor/Seiwa-Genji (Minamoto clan).html">Seiwa-Genji</a> and Koga family of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/family/Murakami-Genji (Minamoto clan).html">Murakami-Genji</a> served as Genji <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Choja.html">choja</a> alternately (the former's tenure was longer than that of the latter). In the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Sengoku Period (period of warring states) (Japan).html">Sengoku Period</a> (Period of Warring States), persons from the Koga family of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/family/Murakami-Genji (Minamoto clan).html">Murakami-Genji</a> were appointed to Genji <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Choja.html">choja</a>. The Tokugawa family monopolized the position of Genji <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Choja.html">choja</a> beginning with <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Ieyasu TOKUGAWA.html">Ieyasu TOKUGAWA</a>. Provided that Tomohiko OKANO presumes that Tatemichi KOGA once became Genji <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Choja.html">choja</a> at the time of disorder in the end of Edo period. </p>
<p>Genji <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Choja.html">choja</a> was merely the highest title among Minamoto clans after the collapse of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Ritsuryo.html">Ritsuryo</a> system. On the other hand, there is a theory, which is based on the theory of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Yoshimitsu ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshimitsu ASHIKAGA</a> equals the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/King of Japan (Nihon Kokuo).html">King of Japan</a>, that <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Ieyasu TOKUGAWA.html">Ieyasu TOKUGAWA</a> saw the advantage of its authority, and changed himself from Fujiwara cognomen to Minamoto cognomen, obtaining power equivalent to that of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/King of Japan (Nihon Kokuo).html">King of Japan</a> by becoming both seii taishogun (literally, great general who subdues the barbarians) and Genji <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Buddhism/Choja.html">choja</a> and used such power for controlling both court nobles and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> families (Tomohiko OKANO). However, the above theory is not accepted commonly. </p>
