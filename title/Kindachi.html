<h1>Kindachi (公達)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The term "kindachi" in a wide sense refers to Shoo (princes without imperial proclamation), but, in a more limited sense, it is used as a term referring to imperial princes and the children of Sekke (the family of regents and advisers), or the Seiga family (the important family next to Sekke). Later, the children of the Taira family also came to be called kindachi. </p>
