<h1>Zuryomei (Honorary titles) (受領名)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Zuryomei were unofficial names for government posts. </p>
<p>They were unofficial names for government posts which the Imperial Court and temples allowed merchants and traders, coming in and going out of the Court and temples, to use. </p>
<p>Mainly over the Muromachi period and the Sengoku period (period of warring states), they were granted as an unofficial name of government post to vassals who had made military exploits and achievements by <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a> <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> (<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a> were Japanese provincial military governors, that became <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a>, which were Japanese feudal lords) and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> (Japanese territorial lord) in the Sengoku period. </p>
<p>Zuryomei given by the Imperial Court and temples<br/>
</p>
<p>In <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, only merchants, traders and performers, who had businesses with the Imperial Court, Gosho (Imperial Palace) and temples, were granted the Zuryomei such as Kami (Governor), Suke (Vice Governor) and Jo (Provincial Governor), and a privileged position to increase their prestige for the social standing and family business. Merchandise dealt by merchants and traders with the Zuryomei was more valuable as a brand and traded at the most extraordinary price among the merchandise made by craftsmen in the same industry. Therefore, many merchants and traders sought the Zuryomei for their honor and prosperous trade. </p>
<p>Especially for the Imperial Court and temples which were exhausted by maelstroms of war and grabs for <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Shoen.html">Shoen</a> (manor in medieval Japan) made by <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> families, to grant official rank and the Zuryomei was an essential source of income. </p>
<p>Zuryomei in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> families<br/>
</p>
<p>After the Muromachi period, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a> <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> started the custom of granting unofficial names of government post without official Ikai (Court rank) and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Jimoku (ceremony for appointing officials).html">Jimoku</a> (<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Appointment (Ninkan).html">appointment</a> ceremonies) from the Imperial Court, to vassals and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Hikan (low ranking clerks).html">hikan</a> (low-level bureaucrats) who had made military exploits. These unofficial names were the Zuryomei. In many cases, the Zuryomei was given to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Kokujin.html">Kokujin</a> (local <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a>) and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Busho.html">Busho</a> (Japanese military commanders) who were under the control of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> (Japanese feudal lords) and also had a castle, territory and military strength. The custom later changed into a state in which the naming such as jikan (official name which <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> called himself without the Imperial Court's involvement), hyakkan na (a name taken after his/her or family's official rank) and azuma hyakkan (titles conferred on <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a>) became popular among <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a>. When the Zuryomei was given by a lord, written <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Appointment (Ninkan).html">appointment</a> to a government service called kanto no kakidashi, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Zuryo (The Head of The Provincial Governors).html">zuryo</a> no kakidashi, kantojo or the like was issued, which was respected as an honor representing a social status and fame of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> family. </p>
