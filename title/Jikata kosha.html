<h1>Jikata kosha (地方巧者)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Jikata kosha was an Edo Period bureaucrat overseeing domain agriculture who had extensive knowledge of regional affairs. After the Kyoho era when hatamoto (bakufu retainers) and gokenin (retainers of the Kamakura bakufu) were organized into the bakufu bureaucracy, jikata kosha posts were often granted to ordinary citizens, and due to the fact that these appointees authored guides to domain administration, they were commonly called jikata kosha. </p>
