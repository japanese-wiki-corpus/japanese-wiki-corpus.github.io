<h1>Moshitsugishu (申次衆)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>"Moshitsugishu" was the name of a post in Muromachi <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>). </p>
<p><a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Moshitsugi.html">Moshitsugi</a>, also called sosha/soja, originally referred to a person in charge of conveying messages to the Emperor or <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Daijo Tenno.html">Daijo Tenno</a> (the Retired Emperor), and in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> and Muromachi <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> it also referred to a person conveying messages to the seii taishogun (literally, "great general who subdues the barbarians"). <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Moshitsugi.html">Moshitsugi</a> in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> also carried out miscellaneous tasks, informed the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> of the names of people who sought an audience with him, and ushered them to the audience. During the period of the sixth <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> of the Muromachi <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Yoshinori ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshinori ASHIKAGA</a>, the post was monopolized by the Ise, Ueno, Odachi and Hatakeyama clans, and they took charge of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Moshitsugi.html">Moshitsugi</a> in turn, forming a group composed of several persons working in shifts. They were called Moshitsugishu, and later this became a term referring to the rank of the family, ranked after Oshobanshu (officials who accompany <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>), <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Otomoshu.html">Otomoshu</a> (group who attended the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a> to the ancient capital <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>), Oheyashu (the position in charge of keeping night watch over the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>'s bedchamber). </p>
<p>Nowadays, Moritoki ISE (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Soun HOJO.html">Soun HOJO</a>) is considered to have been one of the Moshitsugishu. </p>
