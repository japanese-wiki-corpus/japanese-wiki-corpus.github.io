<h1>Honkan (品官)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Honkan was a general term of government posts which did not belong to the system for <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shitokan (four classifications of bureaucrats ranks).html">shitokan</a> (four classifications of bureaucrats' ranks) of each government official in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ritsuryo.html">ritsuryo</a> system (a system of centralized government based on the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ritsuryo.html">ritsuryo</a> code [historical law system]) of Japan. </p>
<p>Chinese <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ritsuryo.html">ritsuryo</a> system also had a government post called 'honkan' but in this case, it meant all government posts (they were equivalent to shikijikan [a person with an official rank but has no corresponding position] in Japan) which belonged to kanhin (governmental officials classified into nine grades from first honkan to ninth honkan) of over Junior Ninth Rank and honkan in Japan had a completely different definition although the name was derived from Chinese honkan (However, it is said that 'honkan' was also used in the sense of shikijikan in Japan). </p>
<p>Honkan in Japan systemically belonged to some government officials but also constituted Bekkyoku which performed technical official duties <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Apart (Apartment).html">apart</a> from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shitokan (four classifications of bureaucrats ranks).html">shitokan</a> and the kanisoto (the ranks of the bureaucracy system under the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ritsuryo.html">ritsuryo</a> system) was provided by Court ranking law. The representative honkan included jiju (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/emperor/Imperial Household Agency.html">Imperial Household Agency</a> staff), <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Naiki (government posts).html">naiki</a> (secretary of the Ministry of Central Affairs), and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kenmotsu (officials belonging to Nakatsukasasho).html">kenmotsu</a> (a auditor <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/literature/Nakatsukasa.html">Nakatsukasa</a> sho, the Ministry of Civil Affairs), who were belonged to Nakatsukasasho (Ministry of Central Affairs), a judge (in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ritsuryo.html">ritsuryo</a> system) who belonged to Gyobusho (Ministry of Justice) and so on. </p>
<p>Chinese <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ritsuryo.html">ritsuryo</a> system also had Bekkyoku but had a policy of sanhansei which 'hangan' who controlled Bekkyoku was placed under the command of 'kami' (a director) who controlled government officials and 'suke' who played a part of tsuhan (an official supporting a governor), and was supervised by kenkosei (system to inspect management), however, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Shitokan (four classifications of bureaucrats ranks).html">shitokan</a> and honkan in Japan were not in such a relationship. It was because in Japanese <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ritsuryo.html">ritsuryo</a> system, each sho (Ministry), <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shiki (a rank in government offices under ritsuryo system).html">shiki</a> (agency), <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Tsukasa (a rank in government offices).html">tsukasa</a> (office) and ryo (bureau) had a certain independence, in addition, it is said that it arose since government officials (such as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Kenmotsu (officials belonging to Nakatsukasasho).html">kenmotsu</a> and a judge) which had existed and been independent before the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Ritsuryo.html">ritsuryo</a> system were forced to be added into jurisdiction of a specific sho with keeping the traditional independence, and as a result, many honkan gathered especially in the Nakatsukasasho which took charge of general affairs within the Imperial Court. </p>
