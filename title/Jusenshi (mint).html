<h1>Jusenshi (mint) (鋳銭司)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Jusenshi (also referred as Chusenshi) was one of Ryoge no kan (class outside of the Ritsuryo system) established in ancient Japan. It was in charge of minting coins. </p>
<p><h3>Official duties and history</h3>
</p>
<p>Jusenshi was in charge of minting coins. This was established for the first time in the period of Emperor Jito, and was also established continuously while changing its name thereafter. When Wado-kaichin silver coins were minted, Saijusenshi was established. From 819 to 825, Jusenshi (administrative officer who oversaw the minting of coins) was assigned in Nagato Province, and concurrently assumed the duties as Nagato no kuni no kokushi (officer in charge of regional administration in Nagato Province). When the minting of coins was stopped in the late Heian period, Jusenshi (mint) was no longer established. </p>
<p>Mints were established in the Kawachi Province, Suo Province, Nagato Province and so on. <h3>Officials</h3>
