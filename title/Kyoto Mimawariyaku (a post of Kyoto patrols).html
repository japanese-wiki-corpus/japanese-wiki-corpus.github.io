<h1>Kyoto Mimawariyaku (a post of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> patrols) (京都見廻役)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kyoto Mimawariyaku was a post established by the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Edo bakufu.html">Edo bakufu</a> to maintain public order in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> at the end of the Edo period. The Kyoto Mimawariyaku retained Kyoto Mimawariyaku Gumi under it. </p>
<p>The Kyoto Mimawariyaku Gumi was installed on May 31, 1864, and the first personnel were Hirotaka MAITA from the Asao Domain and Yasumasa MATSUDAIRA, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Hatamoto (direct retainers of shogun).html">hatamoto</a> (a direct retainer of a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>). In later years, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Chikayoshi HORI.html">Chikayoshi HORI</a> (Shinano Iida Domain), Choen OGASAWARA (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Hatamoto (direct retainers of shogun).html">hatamoto</a>) and Michinori IWATA (<a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Hatamoto (direct retainers of shogun).html">hatamoto</a>) were appointed. </p>
<p>The rank of the post was Obangashira-jiseki (assistant head of Oban) with 5,000 koku (calculation system based on rice) of yakudaka (an allowance) and 3,000 hyo (sack of rice) of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Yakuryo (executive allowance).html">yakuryo</a> (an allowance.)<br/>
Below the Obangashira-jiseki, there were Mimawarigumi-Kumigashira (the head of Mimawarigumi) (300 hyo of bashodaka and Goshoinban-jiseki) and Mimawarigumi-Tsutomekata (200 hyo of bashodaka and Oban-jiseki), below both of which there was the Kyoto Mimawari Gumi of 200 members consisting of the second and third sons as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>'s retainers. </p>
<p>When Yoshinobu TOKUGAWA moved from <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/building/Nijo-jo Castle.html">Nijo-jo Castle</a> to Osaka-jo Castle after Taiseihokan (restoration of the imperial regime), the Mimawariyaku and personnel of lower posts moved to Osaka for protection, but later the Mimawariyaku naturally disappeared. </p>
