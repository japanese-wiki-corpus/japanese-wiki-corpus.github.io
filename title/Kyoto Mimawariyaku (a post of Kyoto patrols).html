<h1>Kyoto Mimawariyaku (a post of Kyoto patrols) (京都見廻役)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Kyoto Mimawariyaku was a post established by the Edo bakufu to maintain public order in Kyoto at the end of the Edo period. The Kyoto Mimawariyaku retained Kyoto Mimawariyaku Gumi under it. </p>
<p>The Kyoto Mimawariyaku Gumi was installed on May 31, 1864, and the first personnel were Hirotaka MAITA from the Asao Domain and Yasumasa MATSUDAIRA, hatamoto (a direct retainer of a shogun). In later years, Chikayoshi HORI (Shinano Iida Domain), Choen OGASAWARA (hatamoto) and Michinori IWATA (hatamoto) were appointed. </p>
<p>The rank of the post was Obangashira-jiseki (assistant head of Oban) with 5,000 koku (calculation system based on rice) of yakudaka (an allowance) and 3,000 hyo (sack of rice) of yakuryo (an allowance.)<br/>
Below the Obangashira-jiseki, there were Mimawarigumi-Kumigashira (the head of Mimawarigumi) (300 hyo of bashodaka and Goshoinban-jiseki) and Mimawarigumi-Tsutomekata (200 hyo of bashodaka and Oban-jiseki), below both of which there was the Kyoto Mimawari Gumi of 200 members consisting of the second and third sons as shogun's retainers. </p>
<p>When Yoshinobu TOKUGAWA moved from Nijo-jo Castle to Osaka-jo Castle after Taiseihokan (restoration of the imperial regime), the Mimawariyaku and personnel of lower posts moved to Osaka for protection, but later the Mimawariyaku naturally disappeared. </p>
