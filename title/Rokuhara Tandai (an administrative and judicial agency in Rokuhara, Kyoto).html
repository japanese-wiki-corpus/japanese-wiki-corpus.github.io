<p></p>
<p>"Rokuhara <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Tandai.html">Tandai</a>" is a job title in the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> (Japanese feudal government headed by a <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>). They are the branch offices that the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> established in the north and south of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Rokuhara.html">Rokuhara</a>, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> by reorganizing the existing <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shugo.html">shugo</a> (<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> military governor) after the Jokyu War in 1221. They are called Rokuhara Tandai Kitakata (Northern Chief of Rokuhara <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Tandai.html">Tandai</a>) and Rokuhara Tandai Minamikata (Southern Chief of Rokuhara <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Tandai.html">Tandai</a>). </p>
<p><h3>Summary</h3>
</p>
<p>As the postwar settlement after the Jokyu War, the territories of the court nobles and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> who supported the retired Emperor Gotoba were forfeited and redistributed to the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Gokenin.html">gokenin</a> (an immediate vasal of the shogunate in the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> and Muromachi through Edo periods) as rewards. These were <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> (manor in medieval Japan) which were not governed by the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> until then, and many were in the west where <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>'s authority was hard to reach. As a result of the redistribution, jito (manager and lord of manor) were assigned to these <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Shoen.html">shoen</a> as well. Additionally, the bakufu-side had to constantly monitor and control the movement of the Imperial Court. </p>
<p>Therefore, they renovated the old home of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/TAIRA no Kiyomori.html">TAIRA no Kiyomori</a> which was located in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Rokuhara.html">Rokuhara</a>, south of Shirakawa City, where they could instantaneously grasp movements at the Imperial Court, into a government office, and stationed <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Yasutoki HOJO.html">Yasutoki HOJO</a> and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Tokifusa HOJO.html">Tokifusa HOJO</a> in the north and south of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Rokuhara.html">Rokuhara</a> for this task, while <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Gokenin.html">gokenin</a> from the west were reorganized to guard <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, monitor the Imperial Court, perform military operations, etc. This is how the Rokuhara <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Tandai.html">Tandai</a> began. </p>
<p>The <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Tandai.html">Tandai</a> was considered the most important post following <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shikken (regent for the shogun).html">shikken</a> (<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Regent.html">regent</a> for <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>) and rensho (assistant to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shikken (regent for the shogun).html">shikken</a>), and traditionally, one person each was chosen for Kitakata and Minamikata from the Hojo clan to perform government affairs. Young and promising personnel from the Hojo clan were often chosen for <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Tandai.html">Tandai</a>, and many were promoted to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Shikken (regent for the shogun).html">shikken</a> or rensho after returning to <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a>. Additionally, subordinate organizations pursuant to organizations in <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> such as <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Hyojoshu (government post).html">hyojoshu</a> (members of Council of State) were set up under it. </p>
<p>Rokuhara <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Tandai.html">Tandai</a> was under the direct command of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> instead of the Imperial Court, and had a judicial function for dealing with trouble between jito and <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Kokushi.html">kokushi</a> (provincial governor), maintained security in the outskirts of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, monitored the Imperial Court, and acted as agents in the imperial throne decision making. Additionally, in 1275, the year following Bunei Battle, the function of Rokuhara <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Tandai.html">Tandai</a> was further enhanced, and authority for punishing <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Gokenin.html">gokenin</a> and the trial system was enhanced. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, the actual binding power for the authority was not necessarily enough in some aspects. Occasionally, the government official punishing dominant temples and shrines received punishment such as banishment due to pressure from monk soldiers who were gaining power at the time, and for example in 1229, the jinin (associates of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/Shinto/Shinto (Shinto religion).html">Shinto</a> shrines) engaging in illegal activities at Hiyoshi-jinja Shrine, which was under the umbrella of <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Enryaku-ji Temple.html">Enryaku-ji Temple</a>, ignored the restraint order by Tamekiyo MIYOSHI (三善為清), who served under <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Tokiuji HOJO.html">Tokiuji HOJO</a> of Tandai North, and was killed by Tamekiyo's subordinate. <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Enryaku-ji Temple.html">Enryaku-ji Temple</a> made a protest to the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> about this, and Rokuhara <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Tandai.html">Tandai</a> presented evidence to show there was no negligence on the part of Tamekiyo and the subordinate, but the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> condemned Tamekiyo to banishment to avoid confrontation with <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Enryaku-ji Temple.html">Enryaku-ji Temple</a>. </p>
<p>Additionally, special envoys called "<a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Toshi (messenger from the Kamakura bakufu to the Imperial Court in Kyoto).html">toshi</a>" (messenger from the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kamakura.html">Kamakura</a> <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>), who were directly sent from the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>, were in some cases, granted authority to directly negotiate with the Imperial Court or to command the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Tandai.html">Tandai</a>, and such authority was constantly restrained by the central power of the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>. Therefore, those familiar with the situation, did not favor a post at the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/history/Rokuhara.html">Rokuhara</a>. </p>
<p>In 1333, when the Genko War erupted from Emperor Godaigo's anti-shogunate movement, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Takauji ASHIKAGA.html">Takauji ASHIKAGA</a>, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Doyo SASAKI.html">Doyo SASAKI</a>, and Enshin AKAMATSU responded to the Emperor's order and attacked <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>. Thus, <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/person/Nakatoki HOJO.html">Nakatoki HOJO</a>, the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Tandai.html">Tandai</a> at the time, and others were forced to leave <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>, and Rokuhara <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/title/Tandai.html">Tandai</a> vanished. Kyoto City Rokuhara Elementary School stands now in its location, and there is the <a href="https://japanese-wiki-corpus.github.io/shrines/Rokuharamitsu-ji Temple.html">Rokuharamitsu-ji Temple</a> nearby. </p>
