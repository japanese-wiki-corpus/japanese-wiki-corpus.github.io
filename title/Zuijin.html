<h1>Zuijin (随身)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Zuijin (also called as zuishin) was a government official in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Konoefu (Headquarters of the Inner Palace Guards).html">Konoefu</a> (the Headquarters of the Inner Palace Guards) during and after the Heian period; zuijin followed nobles to guard them when they went out. 
<br/>Zuijin also refers to the statues which are dressed in zuijin's clothes and enshrined on the left and right sides of shrine gates (zuijinmon) as shrine guards; in this case, zuijin can also be written as '随神.'<br/>
