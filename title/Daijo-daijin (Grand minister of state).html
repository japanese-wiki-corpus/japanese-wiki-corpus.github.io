<p></p>
<p>Positioned above the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Sadaijin (Minister of the Left).html">Sadaijin</a> (minister of the left) and the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Udaijin (Minister of the Right).html">Udaijin</a> (minister of the right), the Daijo-daijin (grand minister of state, also known as Dajo-daijin) was the highest official post in the Daijokan (Grand Council of State) under the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Ritsuryo.html">Ritsuryo</a> system. The Japanese reading is "omatsurigotonomaetsugimi." Equivalent Chinese posts are Shokoku, Daijosho and Taishi. </p>
<p>Summary<br/>
With no particular duties, people such as an emperor's teacher (top instructor) were appointed, so it was not always filled, only when an appropriate person was available. For that reason, it was called a "sokketsu post" ("ketsu" means "absent"). Also, it was the only one exempted from danso (indictment for illegal activities) by the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Danjodai (Board of Censors).html">danjodai</a> (Board of Censors). A post at the rank of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shoichii.html">Shoichii</a> (Senior First Rank), <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Juichii.html">Juichii</a> (Junior First Rank). </p>
<p>Beginning in 671, during the reign of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Tenchi (Tenji).html">Emperor Tenchi</a>, it was abolished with the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/culture/Meiji.html">Meiji</a> period's <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Sanetomi SANJO.html">Sanetomi SANJO</a> (1871-1885) as the last. </p>
<p>In the early years of the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Ritsuryo.html">Ritsuryo</a> system it was treated as a post that could not be filled lightly, and instead an equivalent Chidajokanji was established, to be filled only by members of the imperial family, but later their retainers came to be appointed to Daijo-daijin. Although these conditions lead to a custom of <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Sadaijin (Minister of the Left).html">Sadaijin</a> managing Daijokan in place of Daijo-daijin, later on when <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/FUJIWARA no Yoshifusa.html">FUJIWARA no Yoshifusa</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/FUJIWARA no Mototsune.html">FUJIWARA no Mototsune</a> served as both Daijo-daijin and Sessho (<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Regent.html">regent</a>), there arose some confusion as to the difference in the duties of Daijo-daijin and Sessho, and who would control Daijokan when there were both Daijo-daijin and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Sadaijin (Minister of the Left).html">Sadaijin</a> at the same time. That is when, on June 5, 884, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/emperor/Emperor Koko.html">Emperor Koko</a> invited scholars <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/SUGAWARA no Michizane.html">SUGAWARA no Michizane</a> and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/OKURA no Yoshiyuki.html">OKURA no Yoshiyuki</a> to give their opinions of the authority of Daijo-daijin. As a result, it was decided that, as Daijo-daijin was ultimately the Emperor's teacher, a virtuous person who had rendered distinguished service should be appointed, and he would not have political power, and would not get involved in political affairs of Daijokan (however, when also serving as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Regent.html">Regent</a> or Kanpaku,chief adviser to the Emperor), he would have political power consequent to that position). 
<br/>"<a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Nihon Sandai Jitsuroku.html">Nihon Sandai Jitsuroku</a>"(sixth of the six classical Japanese history texts)<br/>
</p>
<p>As the influence of the Northern House of the Fujiwara clan extended, for the 250 year period from <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/FUJIWARA no Yoshifusa.html">FUJIWARA no Yoshifusa</a> (served 857-872) until <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/MINAMOTO no Masazane.html">MINAMOTO no Masazane</a> (served 1122-1124), the Fujiwara clan maintained a monopoly. </p>
<p>After the end of the Heian period, as a rule only members of Sekke (line of regents and advisers) or the Seiga family (one of the highest court noble families in Japan at that time) were qualified to serve, but in the Edo period it seems that only former Sessho and Kanpaku were appointed to Daijodaijin. </p>
<p>The six Daijo-daijin from <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> families were <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/TAIRA no Kiyomori.html">TAIRA no Kiyomori</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Yoshimitsu ASHIKAGA.html">Yoshimitsu ASHIKAGA</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI.html">Hideyoshi TOYOTOMI</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Ieyasu TOKUGAWA.html">Ieyasu TOKUGAWA</a>, <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Hidetada TOKUGAWA.html">Hidetada TOKUGAWA</a>, and <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Ienari TOKUGAWA.html">Ienari TOKUGAWA</a>. </p>
<p>Investiture of Daijo-daijin while living was rare, but as a posthumous honor, it was sometimes given to Sessho and Kanpaku, to maternal grandfathers of the emperor, and to Seii taishogun (literally, "great general who subdues the barbarians") in the Edo period<br/>
When the post of Daijo-daijin was given after death for meritorious service performed in life, it was "Zo Daijo-daijin" (the Grand Minister, posthumously conferred). There are also cases of people who were de facto regents to the <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shogun.html">Shogun</a>, such as <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/person/Nobunaga ODA.html">Nobunaga ODA</a>, who died without being invested with the title but were given it in a later era (the Taisho period); in fact, immediately after his death he was given the title Juichii Daijo-daijin, but this was changed to <a href="https://www.japanese-wiki-corpus.org/title/Shoichii.html">Shoichii</a> in the Taisho period. </p>
