<h1>Seijisosaishoku (president of political affairs) (政事総裁職)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Seijisosaishoku was one of the three most important posts in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Edo bakufu.html">Edo bakufu</a>, which was newly established towards the end of the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> system in the late Edo period, together with <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun-kokenshoku.html">Shogun-kokenshoku</a> (the post for the guardian of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun.html">shogun</a>) and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> shugoshoku (the military governor of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a>). </p>
<p>In 1862, the Imperial court in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> and the Satsuma domain pressured the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> so as to appoint Yoshinaga MATSUDAIRA, the lord of the Fukui domain of Echigo Province, to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Tairo (chief minister).html">Tairo</a> (the highest post in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> government) and Yoshinobu HITOTSUBASHI to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Shogun-kokenshoku.html">Shogun-kokenshoku</a>. For this, the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> decided to pardon the lords of the Hitotsubashi group, including Yoshinaga and Yoshinobu, on May 23 and appointed Yoshinaga to Seijisosaishoku, on August 4. It is said that this measure was taken because there was no precedent which a lord of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/family/Shinpan (Tokugawas relatives).html">Shinpan</a> (the domains whose lords were male descendents of <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Ieyasu TOKUGAWA.html">Ieyasu TOKUGAWA</a>) assumed <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Tairo (chief minister).html">Tairo</a> (the highest position in the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a> government). Yoshinaga, together with Yoshinobu, conducted the reformation of shogunate administration in the Bunkyu era(1861 - 1864). However, while staying in <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> to arrange a visit to <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/geographical/Kyoto.html">Kyoto</a> by <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Iemochi TOKUGAWA.html">Iemochi TOKUGAWA</a> in 1863, seii taishogun (literally, "the great general who was to subdue the barbarians"), Yoshinaga suffered from confrontation between the Imperial court and the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>, and returned to Echizen, his own domain, after his resignation from his post submitted on April 19, was turned down. For this, he was placed in confinement on May 12, and was dismissed from the Seijisosaishoku post. After that, on November 21, Naokatsu MATSUDAIRA, the lord of the Kawagoe Domain, was appointed as his successor and endeavored to coordinate opinions of the Sanyo-kaigi (councilors' meetings) and the <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Bakufu.html">bakufu</a>. However, the post was abolished on July 25, 1864. </p>
