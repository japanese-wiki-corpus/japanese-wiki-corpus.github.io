<h1>Fushin bugyo (普請奉行)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>The fushin bugyo was a post held by hatamoto (direct retainers of the bakufu, which is a form of Japanese feudal government headed by a shogun) during the Edo period. 
<br/>Shodayu-yaku<br/>
It was also known as gofushin bugyo. "Fushin" here means ' general public laber services' in Buddhist terminology. </p>
<p>The duty was to maintain castle stone walls and its components, as well as its layout. The number of fushin dayu was commonly two. The post was accompanied by salary of 2000-koku rice yield. The subordinates included the shimo-bugyo, aratame-yaku and fushin-kata. </p>
<p>Together with the sakuji bugyo (commissioner of buildings) and kofushin bugyo, these three posts were known as shimosan bugyo (the three commissioners in charge of repair and management). </p>
