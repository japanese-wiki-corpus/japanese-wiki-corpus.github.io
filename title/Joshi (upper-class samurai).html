<h1>Joshi (upper-class <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a>) (上士)</h1>
<p></p>
<p>Joshi was an upper-class feudal retainer in the Edo period. When <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a> were classified from the upper to lower classes as Joshi, Heishi, and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Goshi (country samurai).html">Goshi</a>, Joshi was the highest social standing among them. </p>
<p><h3>Tosa Domain's case</h3>
</p>
<p>The Tosa Domain was known for creating a strict distinction between Joshi and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Goshi (country samurai).html">Goshi</a> (country <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Samurai.html">samurai</a>). When the Yamauchi clan entered the Tosa Province, retainers and followers of the Chosokabe clan, which had ruled the Tosa Province by then, were designated as <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Goshi (country samurai).html">Goshi</a>, and retainers of the Yamauchi clan from the early age as Joshi; this is the beginning of this classification. </p>
<p>The difference is analogous to that between Fudai <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> (a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> in hereditary vassalage to the Tokugawas) and Tozama <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> (a <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Daimyo.html">daimyo</a> who was not a hereditary vassal of the Tokugawa family). </p>
<p>In the Tosa Domain, a strict distinction between Joshi and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Goshi (country samurai).html">Goshi</a> was rigidly maintained; the spectrum of distinction ranged widely such that only Joshi was allowed to wear Tabi (split-toe socks), Geta (a Japanese wooden clog), and Higasa (a parasol). </p>
<p>Hanpeita TAKECHI, who organized the Tosakinno Party in the last days of the Tokugawa shogunate, and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Ryoma SAKAMOTO.html">Ryoma SAKAMOTO</a> were <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/title/Goshi (country samurai).html">Goshi</a> while <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Hisamoto HIJIKATA.html">Hisamoto HIJIKATA</a>, <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Shojiro GOTO.html">Shojiro GOTO</a>, and <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/person/Taisuke ITAGAKI.html">Taisuke ITAGAKI</a>, who assumed key posts after <a href="https://shinsengumi-archives.github.io/japanese-wiki-corpus/history/Meiji Restoration (Meiji-ishin).html">Meiji Restoration</a>, belonged to Joshi. </p>
